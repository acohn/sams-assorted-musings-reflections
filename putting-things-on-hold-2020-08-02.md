No, I'm not really back from being [on hiatus](on-hiatus-2020-07-23).
My muse insisted that I write a followup to help me manage my sanity.
I spent twelve hours working on department matters yesterday
(Saturday).  I started at 7am.  I stopped at 7pm.  Never mind.  I
didn't really stop at 7pm.  But I eased back at 7pm.  Most of my
work had to do with software policy at Grinnell, particularly [the
new guidance on the software review
process](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/IT/SitePages/The%20Software%20Review%20Process.aspx)
[1].  I should not be spending my weekends on that work.  Given the week
I just had, I should not be spending my weeknds on any work.

I'm done.  I can't spend the time on that kind of work any more.  Classes
start in three weeks.  While there are a host of issues of broad concern
that I spend time on, I cannot do so any more.  It's not just that I
cannot write about them any more.  It's just that I can't spend the mental
energy on them.  I guess it's time to make a list.  It's in no
particular order; just the order things came to mind.

1. Support my Tutorial students in selecting courses and in the registration
process.  **Prioritize**.  Registration for first years is next week.

2. Support my returning advisees in handling their fall courses.
**Prioritize**.

3. Read, attempt to comprehend, and respond to software policy on
campus.  **Place on hold.**  I know it feels like others aren't
paying close attention.  I know that my colleagues in the department
want me to prioritize this.  But I can't spend the time or effort.

4. List all the software I rely on in my everyday work (teaching,
research, service, life).  **Place on hold.**  I'll need to cross
my fingers that ITS will not really expect me to check on all this
software.

5. Participate in discussions about balancing support for our students,
particularly our students of color, while also supporting faculty.
**Place on hold.** There's too much anger.  Others are discussing
this matter.  I'll leave it to them.  But for those who worry: _I
do not believe that **anyone** should say the n-word in class._
However, I do believe that there are reasons to use the word in our
classes, such as when faculty in literature or sociology or the
arts select readings or songs or videos or ....  We should find
ways to build inclusive classrooms, using strategies like Dean B's
inclusive syllabus.  Although I am placing this activity, I will
participate in a discussion that one colleague requested.

6. Prepare my tutorial.  **Prioritize**.

7. Work on preparing CSC 151.  **Prioritize**.  Of course, this is
difficult to prioritize given that I don't know what software we
can use [3].  But PM and I can make general plans.  And I can work
more on some of the trouble spots.

8. Participate in the COOL class.  **Unclear**.  I'd like to prioritize
this course.  But so much stuff has been thrown my way and it's
getting too close to classes.

9. Move [my www.cs.grinnell.edu
site](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/).  **Damn!**   I'd
prefer not to prioritize this.  But it needs to be done by the start
of classes, if not sooner.

10. Move and rebuild [the www.cs.grinnell.edu
site](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu).  **Damn!**  I'd prefer not to
prioritize this.  But the site has been on hiatus since last fall,
when ITS took a snapshot.  The data are out of date.  The design
is out of date.  We need to do something.  There are also broader
issues at play, but I will not rant about them here.

11. Continue reporting on the the security, privacy, and FERPA violations
I observe.  **Place on hold**.  Let someone else do it.

12. Oppose repeated incursions on faculty governance.  **Place on hold;
consider giving up**> Let someone else do it.  I'm happy to share
my list if anyone asks [4], but I will no longer raise issues as
they occur.  I've also accepted that it's an increasingly complex
issue: I believe we need to better support staff governance; doing
so may mean giving up some faculty authority [5,6].

13. [7] Challenge Council's critiques of my department.  **Place
on hold**.  I've asked folks to discuss them with my colleagues.
It's off my plate.  But at some time, I'll need to step back up.
Or maybe not; it may be yet another task that consumes my time and
produces no useful results.

14. Reflect on stepping down as chair.  **Place on hold**.  I'm not
sure that anyone can do a better job right now, particularly given
the prior entry.  Right now, it feels like being chair will eventually
damage not only my ability to do the work I most value but also my
psyche.  Maybe by putting enough things on hold, I can fix that.
And, hey, maybe someone will insist that I step down.

15. Work on diversity issues in CS.  **Prioritize**.  First priority: Meet
about GHC (Monday morning).  Next priority: Select book for reading
group.

16. Research project.  **Place on hold.**  My MAP is done.  I've
completed the individual student reports.  I've completed the exit
interviews.  I've reported the grades.  My students are awesome.
I found funding for a few to continue for the next two weeks.  I
can trust them to continue moving MIST forward.  I'll be available
on demand, but that's it.

17. Home and family.  **Prioritize** and then **Prioritize again**.
I'll talk to them about how best to do so.

18. Respond to micro- and macro-aggressions.  **Place on hold**.  They
build.  They build more.  But responding doesn't seem to help.  Maybe
I'll make a list instead.  I need a way for them not to fester [8].

19. Comment on assorted absurdities.  **Place on hold**.  Does anyone
but me care that you can't find the THRIVE principles?  Probably not.

20. Seek counseling.  **Add**.  Given everything above, it seems
necessary.

[1] That document indicates that I may not share any of its content
publicly.  I will not [2].

[2] Will I get in trouble for sharing that note?  I don't think I should.

[3] Calm down, Sam.  It will get resolved.  It may even get resolved
quickly.

[4] President Harris has indicated she will

[5] I wonder how people will react to that comment.

[6] I expect that Middle Son will throw out one of his favorite
quotes from his grandmother: "We don't need to dismantle the
patriachy, we need to mantle the materiarchy."  These days, she'd
probably acknowledge that we need to go beyond gender binaries.

[7] There may never be an endnote #13, but there can be a list item
13.  You all know my favorite quotation about this issue.

[8] No, not Uncle Fester.

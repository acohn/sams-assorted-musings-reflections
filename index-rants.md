[On Grinnell's Completion Rate](completion-rate.html) (Essay #23)

> Grinnell is working hard to increase our six-year completion rate.  
  I reflect a bit on that goal and the way it is being phrased.

[Grinnell's expected student workload](grinnell-workload.html) (Essay #18)

> In spring 2016, Grinnell's Curriculum Committee released [a document
  setting policies for minimum workloads in classes](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/Registrar/Shared%20Documents/semester%20credit%20definition%20RESOLUTION.pdf).
  In this essay, I attempt to reflect on the implications of that 
  document.

[Grinnell's Web Presence](grinnells-web-presence.html) (Essay #54)

> I've spent the past three years complaining about the loss of important
  public information from our Web site.  In this essay, I attempt to tie
  together my various comments on these issues.

Why I complain about software
- *Forthcoming*

> I complain a lot about bad software.  And I think a lot of software
  is bad.  Here I reflect more deeply about these issues.

[Software hammers](software-hammers.html) (Essay #40)

> On the dangers of having too limited a view of software.

On representing dates and times
- *Forthcoming*

> Why I hate things like "12:00 p.m." or "6/12/64".

[Proofpoint: How to make email miserable to use](proofpoint.html) (Essay #21)

> My reaction to Grinnell's installation of Proofpoint.  While I rant
  about bad software in a separate essay, Proofpoint causes me enough
  difficulty that it's worth a separate essay.

Why Grinnell staff with Ph.D's should be allowed to teach.
- *Forthcoming*

> I thought we allowed our Ph.D.-level staff to teach the occasional
  course.  Then I learned that it's only in very specific situations.
  These are my attempts to think through the matter.

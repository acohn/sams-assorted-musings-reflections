I write like ...
================

The other day in English 295, _Lighting the Page_, we were starting to
look at programs that analyze text.  One of the students brought up the
site "[I Write Like](https://iwl.me/)", whose tag line is

> Check which famous writer you write like with this statistical analysis
tool, which analyzes your word choice and writing style and compares
them with those of the famous writers.

I have a lot of samples of my writing available and so I thought it would
be fun to try the service.  I had just written [a fairly extreme rant about
criticizing faculty proposals](criticizing-faculty-proposals), so I started
there.  For that musing, it appears that I write like noted science fiction
writer [Arthur C. Clarke](https://iwl.me/b/a19b4b4).  But that's not the
only musing I've written recently, nor is it the only genre of musing I write.
So let's see who else I write like.

* In [a subsequent rant-like musing on expanding the
  faculty](expanding-the-faculty), I write like noted mystery novelist
  [Agatha Christie](https://iwl.me/b/813f51e6).  However, if I don't
  include the endnotes, it appears that I write like Arthur C. Clarke.
* In [last night's rant-like reflection on the common reading], I write
  like Arthur C. Clarke.  If I don't include the endnotes, I also write
  like Arthur C. Clarke.
* Right before the three rants, I wrote [a profile of my valued colleague,
  Elaine Marzluff](elaine-marzluff).  In that musing, I write like
  Agatha Christie.  If you skip the endnotes, I write like 
  [Anne Rice](https://iwl.me/b/fdfaad03).  I guess it's good to know that
  I don't just write like people who've been honored by the British Empire.
* In [my commentary on ways in which toys that promote one group can
  potentially damage others](mixed-messages-2018-04-11), I write like Arthur
  C. Clarke.
* In [a more positive essay on free book tables](free-book-tables), I still
  write like Arthur C. Clarke.  I'm sensing a pattern here.
* In [a commentary on college visits](https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/two-cultures-revisited) it appears that I write like [David Foster
  Wallace](https://iwl.me/b/d7939cdb) [1].  If I remove the endnotes,
  I write like [Cory Doctorow](https://iwl.me/b/31398c21).  If I remove
  the line that says "Topics/tags: Rants, short, higher ed" but leave
  the endnotes, I write like Arthur C. Clarke again [2].  
* Let's switch genres a bit.  How about my [extended musing on my
  research](annotating-the-web)?  Anne Rice.  Without the topics/tags
  and disclaimer?  Still Anne Rice.  Without the endnotes?  Arthur C.
  Clarke [3].

These are all recent musings.  Has my writing changed over time?  Let's
see.

* My [thank-you note to donors](donor-thank-you), which was my fourth
  musing, is like the style of Agatha Christie.
* My [ode to convocation](convocation), which was my ninth musing,
  is like Arthur C. Clarke.
* My [description of the individually advised curriculum](individually-advised-curriculum) is also like Arthur C. Clarke.  I'm sensing a pattern.

But my profile of Elaine was different.  What about my other profiles?

* [Adrienne Hardin](adrienne-hardin): Anne Rice.  That seems appropriate.
* [Monessa Cummins](monessa-cummins): Agatha Christie.  Perhaps Dame
  Christie's archaeological work is like my writing about MC, or
  vice versa.
* [Doug Caulking](doug-caulkins): Arthur Clarke. 
* [Sarah Purcell](sarah-purcell): Anne Rice.
* [Erik Simpson](erik-simpson): Arthur C. Clarke.

Interesting.  When I write about women, I tend to write more in the
style of women writers.  Let's consider one or two others.

* In writing about [Terry Bisson](terry-bisson), I write like
  [Terry Bisson](http://www.terrybisson.com/).  No, not really.  Let's see
  ... that one is like Arthur C. Clarke.  If we don't count the endnotes,
  I write like [Kurt Vonnegut](https://iwl.me/b/8ccf5154) [4].
* [Grant Gale](grant-gale)?  Arthur C. Clarke.  Without endnotes?  
  Vonnegut.  Interesting.
* [Hallie Flanagan '11](hallie-flanagan)?  Arthur Clarke.  Without
  endnotes?  David Foster Wallace.  It seems wrong that removing
  endnotes makes me more like Wallace.

Okay.  I'm done.  I assume you were done a half a page ago.  But just
in case you're still reading, I do have a few more notes.

It strikes me as a bit strange that I write like fiction writers,
primarily genre writers [5].  I wonder how many essayists and other
non-fiction writers are in the database.  Even though I read way too
much genre fiction as a young adult, I also read a reasonable amount
of non-fiction.  Certainly, you think that I'd be influenced by some of
those writers.  Shouldn't I write more like Mike Royko [6], Bob Greene
[7,8], George Plimpton [9], Greil Marcus [10], Pauline Kael [11], or
Cecil Adams [12]?  Who else did I read regularly back then?  I
can't remember [14].

I also wonder whether we'd see a difference if the algorithm could pay
attention to some of the things I consider part of my personal style,
such as the excessive use of endnotes [15].  Oh well.

I write like Samuel A. Rebelsky.

I write like I write.

I write like myself.

I write.

Postscript: It may not surprise you that [I Write Like](https://iwl.me/)
reports that in this musing, I write like Arthur C. Clarke.

---

[1] I am both saddened and amused to see that the musing that is like
Wallace is one in which I have only two endnotes.

[2] This statistical matching is clearly a highly precise instrument.

[3] I wonder if it's an issue of  paragraph length.  My endnotes are
usually short.

[4] Wait!  I thought that removing endnotes made me *more* like Sir Clarke,
not less.

[5] Doctorow seems to be the one exception, as he writes a lot of non-fiction. 

[6] I'm probably not Chicagoan enough.

[7] No, not the exercise guru.

[8] I'm probably not midwestern enough.

[9] I'm not literary enough.  I'm also not athletic enough.

[10] Not obscure enough?  Insufficiently artistic?

[11] I'm definitely not that brilliant.  I'm not that careful in my
writing.  And I don't write about film.

[12] My essays aren't illustrated.  I'm also not writing informative
essays in response to assorted questions.  That rules out [David Feldman
'71](david-feldman).

[14] I'll let you fill in your own summary of the commonality of those
writers.

[15] I can't remember what this endnote was supposed to say.  I created
the reference and forgot to add the referent.

This weekend, Grinnell's Board of Trustees had their winter meeting on
campus [1].  Among the issues they discussed was the partial expansion
of the [Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers](https://www.ugsdw.org/)
to include some other positions, such as the mailroom [2].  The
Trustees [voted not to permit the
expansion](https://www.grinnell.edu/campus-life/conversations/student-union-expansion).
Michael Kahn '74, Vice Chair of the BOT and Chair of the Trustee
and Administration Working Group on the Expansion, also released
[a nice letter explaining their
rationale](https://www.grinnell.edu/campus-life/conversations/student-union-expansion).
On Saturday afternoon, Board Chair David Maxwell '66, Michael Kahn
'74, and Trustee Angela Onwuachi-Willig â€™94, chair of the Trustee
Task Force on Student Financial Support and Success, hosted a
discussion session about the deliberations and decisions [3].

The session was not nearly as well attended as I had expected it
would be.  As far as I could tell, were fewer than a half-dozen
students (although one was a union leader) a similar number of
faculty, a similar number of trustees, and a bit more staff and
administrators.  A few factors may have led to the lower attendance.
The prior announcement of the decision may have led some folks to
feel that there was little point in attending.  The Trustees had
also just met with the union leadership [4] and that leadership was
off meeting together, or perhaps with other students.  

I'm glad I attended.  While there's a lot of detail in the original
notification and the letter, it was helpful to hear a summary and
some particularly important points.  I appreciate their statement
that "Students shouldn't have to negotiate to afford their Grinnell
education" [5]; that is, union bargaining should not be the thing
that decides whether students can have enough money to thrive at
Grinnell.  I also sympathize with the suggestion that NLRB regulations
can get in the way of productive conversations; I certainly felt
limited in what I could say during the period in which the union
had petitioned to the NLRB for full expansion.

Although the union lost this partial expansion bid, it does sound
like they won in some ways.  The Trustees noted that they expect
to meet with the union leadership each time they are in town, just
like they meet with the SGA leadership.  I even think I heard them
say that they'd tend to talk to the union, rather than the SGA,
about issues of student employment.  I have mixed feelings about
that and raised them at the meeting.  On the one hand, the union
has played an important role in helping the Trustees understand the
financial struggles many Grinnell students face and in raising
issues of inequitable treatment of student workers.  On the other,
they are only tasked with representing one segment of the student-worker
population.  I did hear from the Trustees that they are also open
to meeting with leadership from other student groups.

The Trustees seem very committed to helping all Grinnell students
afford not only to attend Grinnell but also the other things that
go with being a college student.  They were very concerned that
some students could not afford to go home, could not afford their
textbooks, could not afford to eat when they stayed on campus during
breaks [6].

What else did I hear?  They repeatedly noted that Grinnell spends
a greater percentage of its budget on financial aid than almost any
other institution [7].  They seem committed to continuing to support
the UGSDW, albeit only in its role of representing the student
dining workers.  They seem very proud that we have the first
undergraduate-only union in the country.

I look forward to seeing what happens next.

**_Postscript_**: I had mixed feelings about writing and sharing
this musing.  Since so few people were there, it seemed good to
share the information more broadly.  I don't think I've revealed
anything private and the session was open to the campus community.

**_Postscript_**: It may not surprise you to hear that I asked the
first question.  George Drake commented that it wasn't surprising.
I didn't ask about the union.  Rather, I asked about something
related to student work and affordability.  More precisely, I asked
about summer work.  MAP stipends have not changed since 2012 or
before.  And students are expected to pay not only for their living
expenses out of those stipends but also their expected contribution
to their education.  It's even worse for students on Grinnell-supported
internships.  They get funding only for their living expenses and
travel; nothing that they can use toward the expected contribution.
I realize that the funding allows students to pursue unpaid internships
without paying their own cost of living, but the need to come up
with their expected contribution likely makes it less available to
many students.  I asked that the trustees revisit the idea of
allowing high- and middle-need students to opt out of one or two
summers of expected contributions.  It sounds like they are already
thinking about these kinds of issues.  Dean Harris also noted that
they are doing a study about who does and does not take advantage of
these kinds of opportunities.  I just hope that they'll go beyond
the basic data to include interviews; I know some high-need students
who've taken advantage of opportunities, even though it's stretched
them financially.

[1] At least I think it was their winter meeting.  I'm pretty sure
that they are on campus once in the fall, once in the winter, and
once in the spring.  In some years, they also have extra retreats
in the summer and winter.

[2] At least that's what I think the expansion was supposed to include.

[3] Can I call her "Potential Future President Onwuachi-Willig"?  I'd
love to see her in that position.  I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only
one.

[4] I think I heard someone say that the union leadership was not
notified of that meeting before it was announced in an all-campus
memo.  As I've noted before, Grinnell needs to work on its
communication.

[5] That quotation is approximate.

[6] We allow students to stay on campus during breaks, including
winter break.  I know that many institutions kick students out.

[7] Can you say that Berea, and other tuition-free institutions, spend
a higher percentage on student financial aid?  I'm not sure.

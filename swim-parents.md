Scientifically illiterate swim parents
======================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

On Saturday, the Grinnell/BGM swim team hosted a multi-team invite in
Grinnell College's Osgood Natatorium.  For those who haven't been there,
the "Nat", as some refer to it, is a pretty awesome swimming facility.
The pool has ten 25-yard lanes going in one direction and, with some
reconfiguration, can support some number of 50-meter lanes [1,2].
There's an upper-deck of stands, where the fans sit, on two sides.
It feels pretty spacious, but someone told me that we made it just a
bit too small for some state competition that I can't remember.

Like most pools, the Nat is warm, perhaps even hot.  That's appropriate.
You don't want the swimmers to get cold.  Is it hotter than other pools?
I don't think so, but sometimes it feels that way.  I'm pretty sure that
there are regulations on how warm it has to be.  Let's me see.
Article 12 of Section 3 of the [NCAA Rules](https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Swimming%20and%20Diving%20Pool%20Diagram.pdf) say that 

> The  water  temperature  should  be  between  79  and  81  degrees
Fahrenheit  [26°  and  27°C]  for  competition.  When  possible,
the  air  temperature at  deck  level  shall  not  be  more  than  four
degrees  Fahrenheit  below  the  water temperature. 

That means that the temperature at deck level should be a bit warmer
than 75 degrees, which is warmer than most people keep their spaces.
However, as we learned in science class, hot air rises.  So I assume
that it's a bit warmer in the stands than it is on the deck.  And,
it's a wet heat rather than a dry heat.

Here's the problem.  To deal with the heat, some parents decide
that it makes sense to prop open a door to the stands to let in some
cool air.  But, well, cooler air falls.  So when they let in cool air,
the deck area gets cooler, the heaters kick on, and everything gets
hotter again.  For the folks not near the open doors, it's even hotter [3].
Propping open the doors is a selfish move; while it may make it cooler
near you, it makes it hotter near everyone else, and it wastes energy.

I try to tell people that when I remove the garbage cans that they've
used to prop the door.  But when I walk away, someone else decides to
prop it open again.

Perhaps I should make signs:  _Prop a door, contribute to local and global
warming_.  Signs that need explanations are rarely helpful.  But maybe with
a short paragraph.

> When you prop the door open, cold air enters the area and falls to
pool level.  The thermostat is at pool level, so the heater then kick on, 
making the room hotter.  Please don't prop the doors!

It's a thought.

Postscript: I had some difficulty naming this musing.  The first version
was "clueless swim parents".  But that's a bit broad.  The next was "annoying 
swim parents".  And they are.  But swim parents can we annoying for many
reasons.  So I've settled on a more precise description.

[1] As far as I know, NCAA Division III and high-school competitions
generally use 25-yard lanes and the Olympics uses 50-meter lanes.

[2] The 50-meter lanes have been useful for the Grinnellians who train
for the Olympic Games or the Commonwealth Games.

[3] I'm beginning to worry about Grammarly.  It suggested "more heated"
as a replacement for "hotter" because I used "hotter" too much.

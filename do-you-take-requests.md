"Do you take requests?"
=======================

*Forthcoming.*

---

Notes:

It appears that I've now gathered enough of an audience that I'm starting
to get requests.  "Sam, will you write about the election?"  "Sam, will
you write about Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize?"  "Sam, will you write about me?"
"Sam, will you re-write your Posse essay?"  I'm now faced with an important
question: Should I take requests?

Two of my favorite performers, Van Morrison and Jonathan Richman, are
known to be relatively hostile to requests, or at least requests that
reflect back on their early careers [1]. ...

Like those performers, I'm generally guided by my muse, rather than by
particular expectations of what I should write.  I've regularly found that
when I sit down to write, my muse convinces me to write something other
than what I'd planned. ...

Many of the requests don't seem to relate to my primary themes, which
are Grinnell, Computer Science, Higher Education, and Myself [2].
I don't write much, if anything, about politics [3].  While I've
written a little bit about music, I haven't written about literature
or poetry.  So why these requests?  I'm not sure.

It may be dangerous to write about political stuff.  FIRE

[1] As he's aged, Morrision seems more willing to sing "Brown Eyed Girl".
And as he's aged, Richman seems more willing to embrace the early Modern
Lovers sound.  But still, it's clear to me that they do what they want,
rather than what their fans request.

[2] I capitalized everything else.  It makes sense for my to capitalize
"Myself".

[3] Well, I write about campus politics.

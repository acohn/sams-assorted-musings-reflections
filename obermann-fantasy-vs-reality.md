The fantasy and reality of my Obermann fellowship
=================================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

As things start to wind down for my Obermann fellowship, I continue to
find myself incredibly grateful to the time and the space the fellowship
afforded me.  Being able to try to focus primarily on the FunDHum materials
is likely to provide many benefits, not only in terms of re-energizing my
teaching and giving us an exciting new version of the 151, but also in
helping me think more broadly about computing and about my approach to
my professional life.

Nonetheless, as I look back to my original plans for the fellowship, I
find that there are some fairly large gaps between what I had hoped for
the fellowship and what I actually accomplished.  I thought it would be
useful to record them so that I can make sure that I make more realistic
plans and so that I can do take advantage of the the opportunities I
do have.

_I will be able to separate myself from Grinnell._

Too many things came up.  Some required me to be on campus.  Some just
interfered with my thought processes.  

_I will travel to the Obermann Center four days per week._

In part because of the things I mentioned above, I ended up at Grinnell
more often than I'd planned.  Hence, most weeks ended up involving only
three days at the center, and a few had only two.

_I will appreciate the time traveling back and forth._

I like driving with NPR.  But not a good fall to listen to the radio.
Books on tape (Michael Perry) helped somewhat, but not enough.

_I will go to talks, movies, and book events in the evening._

Particularly since I was leaving home before 7 a.m. to get to Obermann,
the thought of staying late did not seem as attractive as I thought it
would.  And, on many nights in which there was something particularly
attractive in Iowa City, I had more important family obligations [1].
I had hoped to participate in the talks in the CS department.  However,
those are generally on Fridays.

In spite of those challenges, I did make it to some really good and really
useful talks.

_I will explore the restaurants of Iowa city._

I have gone to a few places.  But my time in Iowa city seems so precious
that I'd rather hang out the center and work than walk downtown and eat.
Being here less often doesn't help.

_I will appreciate being able to stop at Costco, Stuff, the Outlet mall,
and other shopping places._

By the time I leave, I just want to get home.  Darker days have also
not helped.

_I will be able to write the code, reading, a lab for each day of class
in one or two days._

Historical evidence.  But seems less true this time.

_I will read an article or a book chapter each day._

Great idea from a colleague.  Not quite sure why I didn't happen.  I
probably didn't prioritize enough.  Or I'm too distractible.  I do
plan to revisit.

_I will spend time reading in the library, yard, or sunporch._

Once I was in my office, it was hard to get myself out.  I like
my view of sun and trees.  But moving spaces would have been good.

_I will meet with people._

Didn't make enough progress for it to be useful.  Bleh.

More seriously, here are some lessons for the future: 

* Don't say "I will continue my service."  Don't plan to continue service.
* Even if you are in Grinnell, limit your time on campus.
* Things build (or cascade) (or both).  Each compromise in one area
  is likely to affect other areas.  So be careful when you compromise.
* Expect the unexpected.
* Travel time is not free.
* You only have so much mental energy each day.  Use it wisely.
* Dn't sit in one space.

Can I have a do-over?

[1] I consider it a positive step that I now prioritize things like
cross country meets over academic talks.

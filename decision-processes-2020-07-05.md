**_This musing is a DRAFT.  Please do not read it unless you have
been authorized to do so._**

I assume a variety of people are wondering what goes into some of the
decisions that have been made for this coming fall.  At least
I know that I often wonder.  So I thought I'd share a bit of one
small decision process.

Let's start with some background.  Curriculum Committee is charged
with a variety of tasks.  One of those is to determine the cohorts
who will be returning to campus in each term [1].  They've already
made some broad decisions for the fall, such as that first-year
students will be invited for F1 and F2 [2] and that most of the
additional students in F2 will come from the second-year class.  Or
maybe some of those decisions were imposed on them.  It's hard to
tell from the outside.

Now it appears that they are trying to come up with some guidance
about which subset of the second-year class should come for F2.
At first glance, you might say "Well, it should be the lab science
students."  Or maybe you say "It should be the art students."  Or
maybe you say "Students in small seminars."  Curriculum Committee is
clearly considering these matters.  But they're trying to be
collaborative in this process, at least I think they are trying to
be collaborative.  Perhaps they haven't thought about an academic
subgroup that would benefit from being on campus.  So, late Thursday,
I received a message as department chair.

> From: "Curriculum Committee Science Representative" <ccscirep@grinnell.edu>  
> Subject: CSC Student Cohort for F2  
> Date: July 2, 2020 at 8:54:10 PM CDT  
> To: "Rebelsky, Samuel" <REBELSKY@Grinnell.EDU>

> Dear Sam,

> I am seeking input from your department as Science Division representative to the Curriculum Committee.

> As you likely know, the Curriculum Committee has been working to identify a cohort of students to invite to be on campus for the upcoming F2 term. While we have worked out a likely slate of students in courses that plan to meet in person, we are also looking to strengthen the second year cohort by identifying other possible courses that have high numbers of second-year students enrolled, even if those courses are not meeting in person, and inviting those second year students. In this way, the students might still find themselves in an academically profitable situation by being able to form scurries and study groups.)

> With the help of the Registrar’s office, I have identified the following courses as (currently) having high enrollments among second-year students:

> CSC-161-01 (16 students)  
> CSC-207-01 (13 students)  
> CSC-151-02 (12 students)

> I apologize if some of these courses may have ended up being slated into F1; I don’t have that information on hand.

> My question for you is whether you think it would be helpful to your department and the *second-year* students in any one of these courses to be on campus together as part of the F2 cohort.

> I recognize we are entering a long weekend, which I do hope you will utilize to find some respite. If you could please let me know your thoughts by Tuesday morning, I would greatly appreciate it.

> At that point, I will consolidate information from across the Science Division and make  recommendations to the Curriculum Committee.

> Thank you,

> Your Curriculum Committee Representative

I have anonymized names to protect the innocent.

Perhaps I should start with a small rant.  I find it ironic that
the College is officially on a long vacation weekend for Friday through
Monday [3], but we're still supposed to get this to Curriculum Committee by
Tuesday morning.  The new Acting Dean even reinforced the need for a
break in her introductory statement to the College's employees during
a Thursday noon meeting.

But it's hard to rant when I note that the staff of the Registrar's
office are not getting the long weekend off [4].  In comparison, this
task is a relatively small burden.

What else went through my head as I got ready to respond?  The first
thing I noted is that the message has gone to me as Department Chair
[5].  In some models of governance, I would respond without involving
my department.  But I prefer a collaborative department.  So I
forwarded the message along to my colleagues, along with own thoughts
on the matter.  Once I'd recorded my thoughts (and, in doing so,
found myself thinking more about these matters), I decided it would
make a useful musing.  So I added some "wrapper text" and even
learned some new things writing that text.  And now you get to read
this musing.

Before I move on to my reflections, I should provide a little bit more
context on the three courses mentioned in the email.  

CSC-151 is our introductory course in CS, intended as both a general
education course and as the first course in the major.  We are
planning two online sections of CSC-151, each with thirty-six
students [6].  One section will be held in Fall Term 1 and one will
be held in Fall term 2.  We have somewhere between eighteen and
twenty-four returning students enrolled right now.  A few of the
second-year students are prospective majors; the remaining returning
students are taking the course out of general interest [7].  Given
past history, we expect both sections to fill.

CSC-161 is the second course in our introductory sequence.  The majority
of the students taking it are considering a CS major.  But there are also
a variety of other students who are taking it, most often because they 
are enjoying CS and want more or because they see value in the material
for their major (e.g., Physics, Applied Math) or graduate plans.  We are
teaching two sections of CS-161 this fall, one in each term.  It is capped 
at 24 students.  Section 2, to be offered in Fall Term 1 [8], has 
twenty-four students enrolled.  Section 1, to be offered in Fall Term
2, is over-enrolled with twenty-eight students [9].

CSC-207 is the third course in our introductory sequence.  It has
a similar population to CSC-161, although perhaps with fewer of
those students who are not planning on CS majors.  We are offering
two sections, one each term [10].  Both have a capacity of twenty-four
students.  I thought both were full, but I see that Section 1
currently has four open slots.

We teach all of these classes using what we refer to as "workshop-style
pedagogy".  On most days, students come to class having done a short
reading in advance and spend their time working in pairs on a series
of problems we have assigned while the class mentor [11] and faculty
member wander through the room, looking over shoulders, asking and
answering questions.  Some might apply the term "flipped classroom",
but there's a question as to whether flipped classrooms expect
students to prepare by watching a video rather than reading a text.
In any case, we think students learn best by doing, and by doing
in pairs.  How we're going to do that online is a subject for another
musing [12].

That pedagogy will not translate well to the socially distanced
classroom.  And, as you might have noted, these classes have
relatively large capacities, at least for Grinnell, and we expect
them to be full.  Hence, we plan to offer all of our classes online
this fall.  Having large classes at capacity also limits our agility.

What else do you need to know to understand my thought processes below?
In no particular order, here are a few notes that may be of use in
decoding my thoughts.

* A "scurry" is a group of students who are expected to be together and
  do not have to maintain social distance.
* There are rumors that if all the students in a class are in the same 
  scurry, those students will not have to maintain social distance [14].
* There are rumors that there will be some attempts to form scurries based
  on the classes students are taking.
* The CS major is one of the largest majors on campus, graduating
  approximately sixty students each year.
* Grinnell has about 20% international students.
* The CS major has about 40% international students.
* As I understand it, international students currently residing
  outside the US are unlikely to be able to return to the US this fall.
* As I understand it, international students currently residing in the
  US are likely to be on campus this fall.
* About half of our majors come from students who take 151 in the
  fall of their first year.  About half come from students who take 
  151 in the spring of their first year.  There are also a few who
  start in their second year.  And a few who place out of 151 [15].
* Since we have a set introductory sequence (CSC-151, CSC-161, CSC-207),
  the students who start in fall often seem to form one cohort of 
  students and those who start in the spring form another.  In the
  third year, we see the cohorts mixing much more.
* The CS department is (mostly) housed on the third floor of Noyce.
* In normal years, we have open labs available in the evening with
  "Evening Tutors" available to answer questions.  We encourage
  students to work in our labs.  From what I can tell, because we
  have a lot of students working on Noyce Third, and because Grinnell
  students are generous in their willingness to help each other,
  Noyce Third builds community.

With that out of the way, let's move on to my thought processes, at least
as I developed and documented them in an email message to my colleagues. 

---

I'm not sure that I have a good answer to CC's question, in part because we don't have access to the broader context.  But I'm going to do the best I can to think through the issues.

Some reasons to have students on campus: If they are (i) on campus, (ii) in the same scurry, and (iii) the only students in that section, and (iv) social distancing in classrooms is not required for students from the same scurry, then (a) we could have a reasonable-sized in-person class, (b) they could work together on assignments in person, and (c) we can build community in the major.  Of course, postcondition a also requires that (v) the instructor is willing to teach in person in that situation, and postcondition b requires that (vi) we are able to make our lab open to these students at other hours.  Ideally, it also benefits from (vii) having a class mentor in the scurry to help them in the lab.  That mentor could also be someone who is immune to the novel coronavirus/Covid-19.  (Do we have such students?)

Some corresponding challenges (other than the preconditions I just mentioned): These classes will all have at least twenty-four students.  So would either have to (viii) add a section of these courses [almost certainly necessary for 151, since the other section would be first-years], (ix) swap enough F1 students into F2 and F2 students into F1 to make the F2 sections 24 on-campus students or at least all of the second-year students in those multiple sections (the latter case is for 151), (x) make sure the students are in the same scurry, or (xi) accept that not all students who have signed up for these courses will get them.

Some corresponding problems: For 161 or 207, we would be dividing the second-year cohort into two different groups: Those who got to be on campus in F2 and those who did not.  I worry about the effect of that on the department culture as a whole.  We already have a bit of a split between those who take 151 in the fall and those who take 151 in the spring; this will further divide one or more of those groups.  On the other hand, we're already dividing the F1's from the F2's, so who knows.

Given that our major is about 40% international students, I would expect that a reasonably large proportion of the 161 and 207 students scheduled for the spring sections will not be able to be in the US.  I don't know what that does about the divide.

Then there's the question of the benefit of having students on campus even if the class does not meet in person.  The primary benefits I see are providing a space for collaborative homework (as before: If they are in the same scurry, if the space can be made available, and, optionally, if we can get a class mentor into the space/scurry).  That still has the corresponding problem of dividing the "haves" (those on campus) from the "have nots" (those not on campus).

Now that I've thought this through (by writing all of the above), my sense is that the only model that I think would work would be something like the following:

* All/most second-year students who are enrolled in 151 are on-campus in F2; the remainder must take 151 online in F1 (assuming we are offering 151 online in F1; there are a lot of moving pieces here).
* All of those students are in the same scurry.
* The instructor is willing/able to teach that class in person.
* We can give that scurry access (perhaps exclusive) to 3813 or 3815.
* We add a second F2 section of 151 for either (a) online first-year students or (b) a scurry of first-year students.
* If we choose (b) for the second section, it also has similar expectations.

Come to think of it, if we're going with that model, then I'd want the F1 first-year 151 cohort to be in-person, too, so that all of the 151 students get the same in-person experience and we don't have "haves" and "have nots".

That feels like more preconditions than I think we can meet.  And I really worry about the effects of community on creating divides in the department.  I would say that it would not be particularly helpful to our department to have these students on campus as part of the F2 cohort.

But those are just my opinions.  I'd love to hear yours.  Feel free to respond to this email or to start a conversation in Teams.  (I'm still not sure which is better.)  You should also feel free to ignore all of this.  It is, after all, supposed to be time off.

---

And there you have it.  How I thought through the issues.  Or at least
how I started to think through the issues.  Conversation with colleagues
will further shape my thoughts.  Musing has further shaped my thoughts.

I hope reading this too-long musing suggests the complexities that folks
are facing right now.  Here, we're dealing with a small part of just one
decision.  Still, there are a lot of moving pieces and conflicting
priorities to consider.

I appreciate all the work that my colleagues are doing to bring
together for a successful fall, providing the best experience for
our students, and making the best and fairest choices they can not
only for which students will be on campus, but also for the wellness
of employees.  It's hard.

**_Postscript_**: I found myself wondering whether I should post this
musing.  But then I remembered, "Transparency" is part of the T in
"THRIVE". [16]

> Talk to Improve **Transparency**

> Health and Safety

> Re-imagine and reconsider what is possible

> Inclusion requires flexibility

> Value all experiences of vulnerability

> Empathy

Musing is a kind of talking, right?  In any case, transparency is the
ultimate goal.

**_Postscript_**: It was only when I sat down to write the introduction
to this musing that I realized that the request from Curriculum Committee
was not so much a request that we find reasons to invite students so much
as an attempt to figure out the "studio art, music, lab science, *what
else?* question.  Here's how I phrased it to my colleagues.  

> We know why some sets of students should be on campus, such as students in Studio Art or Lab Science.  But there are others we may not be thinking about.  For equity, we should ask all departments.

I wish they'd included that note.  I would have found that version much 
easier to answer.  But it's hard to get things perfect, or even close to
perfect, when you're working at the pace that people need to work.
And perhaps my reading was colored by a Wednesday message asking
about whether we wanted to offer these classes on campus.

---

**_Postscript_**: I don't know whether or not it's worth bringing
up, but I should note that the faculty who are participating in all
of these processes, who are spending their summers rebuilding their
classes for compressed terms and online offerings or socially
distanced classrooms, and who are doing additional training to be
better at these new kinds of training are doing all of this work
as unpaid labor.  We have nine-month contracts.  Our nine months
nominally finish at graduation and don't resume again until the
start of classes.  Our summer labor is a labor of love. But it
comes at some cost, such as cost to research time or time we would
be spending on other professional activities.

Although "Equity" is not explicitly one of the THRIVE principles,
I should note that many, but not all, faculty are comparatively
privileged.  Our jobs pay well.  We can mostly work from home during
these times.  While some of us have explicit other summer commitments,
many of us can find ways to spare the time for this additional work
without affecting our ability to take care of ourselves or our
families.

[1] I'm not sure whether they got to make some of the initial decisions.
However, they are currently making some decisions.

[2] F1 is the first fall term, which will include first-year students as
well as students who Student Affairs has identified as needing to
be on campus.  F2 is the second fall term.

[3] There are still a variety of people who have to work during the
extended weekend, such as those charged with feeding our students or
keeping campus safe.  I appreciate the extra work those folks are
providing.  When you return to the main narrative, you'll see another
group of folks.

[4] Is an extended vacation for most of campus good if it makes
some of our most over-burdened employees feel like they are getting
left out?  I hope they are being compensated in other ways, such as
an extended vacation at some other time and bonus pay.

[5] As of July 1, 2020, I am once again Department Chair.  I am not
sure how long this term will last.  I believe I am unofficially 
committed until June 30, 2023, but there are other issues at play.

[6] We normally have three in-person sections of twenty-four students.

[7] We always hope to grab a few unplanned majors (or at least people who
end up discovering they love CS) from that group, too.

[8] Why is Section 2 in Term 1 and Section 1 in Term 2?  Because the
magic optimization algorithm placed them that way.  

[9] Henry Walker, who was originally scheduled to teach section 2, is
much too generous.

[10] Yup, those were flipped, too.

[11] Think "Teaching Assistant", although it's a bit more complex than
that.

[12] Or more.

[14] The scurry will still be expected to wear masks or face shields
in class.  The faculty and class mentor will still have to maintain
social distance from those students and will also wear masks or
face shields.

[15] I do realize that those numbers don't quite add up.

[16] Or is it "T.H.R.I.V.E."? [17]

[17] Perhaps I should muse about the THRIVE acronym.  We'll leave that
for another day.  Maybe another decade.

title: Preregistration for Spring 2021

tags: [Registration](index-registration), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), assorted data, rambly, long, end-notable
blurb: A musing both expected and unexpected.

_Warning!  This musing has received **no** rewriting and no editing [1].
Writing what you see already took too much of my life._

It's 7:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  I should be in bed.  I'm behind on
sleep [3].  But I had nightmares [4].  So I'm less tired and more wired
than I should be.

Plus I have a lot to do for my class:  grading (wrapping up
mini-project 2), assignments to write (seven sample questions, seven
makeup questions, and seven new questions for the next set of
learning assessments [5]), grading (quizzes), writing ("The Zen of
Booleans", "How to format your Racket code", "Higher-order list
tips and tricks), grading (initial grading of mini-project 3),
and more.

I also have things to do for the department: prep for our meeting with
the Dean about technology policies [6], comments about dealing with the
mess that is preregistration, a long-outstanding response to our external
review [7], some clarification on the upcoming discussion of individual
learning at Grinnell [8], and some other things that I'm forgetting.

Nonetheless, preregistration just ended, and I always muse at the
end of preregistration.  It's also the first (and hopefully only)
preregistration in which we're dealing with terms (semisemesters),
rather than semesters.  It is likely the last preregistration in
which I can refer to the current [summary of course
offerings](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/)
[9]; it's custom ITS software, and I've been told we're discontinuing
both custom ITS software and Web Advisor [10].  It may be the last
time we refer to it as "preregistration"; there's a move to calling
it "open registration".  I anticipate that it will soon be called
"individually advised registration".  And then there's the chance
that the whole process will go away.  President Harris has already
expressed concern about our process and suggested that she will
push to change it [11].  Plus, my readers have been clamoring for
a musing about preregistration [12].  And I haven't had enough
chance to write for fun recently [14].

So, I'm musing about preregistration at Grinnell.  Maybe I'll go back
and take a nap afterwards [16].

## Background: Registration at Grinnell

One of the the longstanding issues at most institutions of higher
education is how you manage the pairing of students with classes,
which is traditionally done in a process known as "registration".
I suppose it must be relatively straightforward at institutions
that do not cap class sizes: just let students register for what
they want.  But at institutions with limited-size classes, there
needs to be a way to decide which of the many students that want,
say, Shakespeare [17] or Film Studies [18] or Introductory Computer
Science [19] can do so.  First-come, first-served is not particularly
fair.  Economic systems in which you bid on classes prioritize
students of a particular mindset.  Other prioritization systems (e.g.,
"seniors first") can make it hard for students to progress in majors
and sometimes lead to five-year degrees.

Most institutions have at least one characteristic that helps them
manage these complexities: general education requirements.  GenEd
requirements provide a useful mechanism for predicting demand.  I
assume they make it easy to shift students ("Oh well, you didn't get
this course that meets this requirement; you can just take one of the
three others.")

But Grinnell has an open curriculum [20] with no general education
requirements.  We can still do some predictions: Students will always
want to take Shakespeare and Film Studies.  But student characteristics
change. It was not long ago that our introductory philosophy courses was
one of the first to fill, and that's no longer the case.  There are even
regularly spaces in introductory economics.

So Grinnell does something different.  We pretend that there are no caps
on classes [22].  Students register [23].  We then look at where things
stand and in a frantic process known as "Cut, Close, Balance" (CCB), we
try to deal with over-enrolled and under-enrolled classes.  Here are
some typical strategies.

* In courses with multiple sections in which one section has high enrollment
  (particularly over enrollment) and one has lower enrollment, we ask the
  Registrar to see which students can move from the too-big section to the
  section with space.  That is, we balance.
* When one course in a department is over-enrolled and another course has
  very low enrollment, we might drop the low-enrollment course,
  add a section of the over-enrolled course and shuffle teaching.
  Shuffling teaching is hard, since not everyone can or should teach
  every course, but we do try to support our students.
* There are also variants of the prior approach that involve combining
  courses and other creative activities.
* When a course in a department is over-enrolled and there is a possibility
  of bringing in another teacher (e.g., a Senior Lecturer who is teaching
  less than a full load or a faculty member in a shared position), we ask
  the Dean to come up with money for another section.
* We cut students from the course.  There are lots of policies for cutting.
    * In CS, we tend prioritize students who most need the course (e.g., seniors
      who need it for graduation; CS majors) and then try to look at the bigger
      picture.  For example, a major taking only one CS course is likely to
      have priority in that one course over a major taking two CS courses.  
    * The Registrar's office will also cut randomly if we ask nicely.
    * Some students believe that sending notes explaining why they should be 
      kept in the class helps.  In some situations, it may.
    * We might survey students or ask them to volunteer to be cut.
    * I always want to cut to below the cap to allow for students who have
      unexpected arguments.  The Registrar's office is not generally
      sympathetic to that approach.
* We allow courses to over-enroll.  That's not a great strategy.
  There's generally a good reason we've set a particular course
  capacity.  Larger courses tend to provide a less good student
  experience and to put significantly more burden on the instructor.

I've been told that the Dean will require departments to cancel
courses below a certain enrollment.  I don't quite understand how
that works.  What does the person teach instead?  I suppose a cut
fall course could lead to an extra spring course, but a faculty
member teaching two in the fall and three in the spring should not
be forced to teach three in the spring.  And I assume that required
courses are held no matter what.

## Background: Terms

That's the process in a normal year.  But this is not a normal year.  This
fall, most of our classes are online.  This spring, most of our classes will
be online [24].  More importantly, it was decided [27] that we would split
our fourteen-week semesters into seven-week "terms" [28].  Rather than taking
four courses in a typical semester, students would take two courses in a 
typical term.  Rather than teaching two or three courses in a typical semester
[30], faculty would teach one or two [31].

Terms permit the College to be more "agile".  Depending on how the pandemic
progresses, we can add students to campus in each term or remove students
from campus.  At least that's the plan.

I'm a big fan of agility.  I teach agile methods in many of our classes.
But I'm not a big fan of terms.  Maybe I'll write about that at some point.
I'll just note that those who made the switch did not predict (and probably
could not have predicted) all of the effects.

The switch to terms---along with some of the followup decisions---has had a 
clear effect on preregistration and on the CCB process.  Here are a few.

* Students have less complete information about course offerings.  Right
  now, it's not clear which courses are synchronous and which are
  asynchronous.  (At least I couldn't figure it out easily.)  So two
  classes that appear to conflict may not.  Because we have slotted
  every course into a fairly large block (approximately ten hours
  per week), it's not possible to tell whether two courses in the
  same block really conflict.  For example, it appears that I am teaching
  two courses at the same time in Spring Two.  But one meets Monday/Wednesday
  and one meets Tuesday/Thursday [33].
* The registration process was more difficult, because we had to
  handle twice as many screens (e.g., two, rather than one, for the
  list of offerings; two, rather than one, to select and register
  for courses).  Usually, I get to check off "It's okay if *this
  student* takes any section of *this course*."  Now I have to check
  it off for two semesters.  Course planning felt harder to me.
* We had different policies for when to offer classes.  Normally,
  there are "popular times" (e.g., 11 a.m.) and "unpopular times"
  (e.g., 8 a.m.) for classes.  The Registrar's office normally
  requires departments to limit the number of courses in popular
  times and to have a minimum number of courses in unpopular times.
  This year, we had no such limits.  But we were encouraged to offer
  multi-section courses in different time slots to give students
  more options [34].  Not all departments followed that guidance.
* There's a new course time: evenings from 7:00-8:50 p.m. Central
  time.
  Students are generally trying to avoid having both 8:00 a.m. and
  7:00 p.m.  classes [35].
* Balancing sections between terms is much more difficult.  The
  Registrar's office won't do it for us (and I don't think they
  should).
* Switching faculty teaching responsibilities is likely to be much
  more difficult.

And there are a host of other issues at play.  We have more students
on voluntary leave than normal.  On the other hand, we have fewer
students studying abroad.  I don't know how that affects overall
enrollment, but it may affect the balance of students and student
interests.  

Then there are other issues that affect course choices.  The economy
may make students and parents even more focused on jobs and their
beliefs about majors and jobs.  Course formats (or assumed formats)
likely play a role in student decisions.  Some students really like
asynchronous classes [36].  Many do not.  Workload is likely an
issue.  While all of our four-credit classes are supposed to require
approximately 24 hours of work per week [37,38], I assume there's
fairly wide variance and that students are good at sharing that
information with each other.  Some courses seem unnatural in a remote
format.  From what I hear, students would much prefer in-person lab
and studio art courses to online versions [39].  And, while there's
a lot of excitement to doing new forms of theatre online, it appears
students are reluctant to step that far outside their comfort zone.

## On to the enrollments

Whoops.  I've written about 2500 words [40] and I haven't even
gotten to the main focus of this piece: The state of enrollments
after preregistration but before CCB.  At least I assume it's before
CCB.  I've grabbed the data on Saturday morning.  I don't think CCB
will start until Monday.  But you never know.  Some faculty are
pretty aggressive about getting these steps done.  I don't even
know when CCB decisions are due.

How should I approach the problem?  In some years, I've done it
alphabetically, but I run out of interest midway through.  In other
years, I've done it by enrollment.  Maybe I'll just look for some
topics of interest and write until I get bored.

### Computer science

How do things stand in CS?  About the same as they always stand.  Many
of our classes are over-enrolled.  Others are full, or close to full.  A
few have less enrollment [41] than we'd expect.  As department chair,
I should probably think through these things in preparation for today's
letter to the department.

**CSC-151**, _Functional Problem Solving_, is over-enrolled by five
students (37 instead of 32) in Spring One and under-enrolled by one
student (31 instead of 32) in Spring Two.  We increased the capacity
of CSC-151 this year from 24 to 32 or 36 [42].  I saw a lot of
shuffling in the Fall 2 section of CSC-151.  I'm teaching the
over-enrolled section.  In a normal year, I'd probably cut the
3rd-year students in 151 and put them on a waiting list.  This year,
I'll probably send a message to the class letting them know that
it's a synchronous class with expected attendance.  If everyone
wants to stay, I'll let them stay.

We also increased the capacity in **CSC-161**, _Imperative Problem
Solving_, from 24 to 32 students.  We have 29 in the Spring One section
and 29 in the Spring Two section.  Cool!  There's a little bit of
slack for students who neglected to enroll and there's no need to
balance.  We would have needed three sections in a normal semester
(or we would have needed to cut students), which I should keep in
mind for spring Two022.  Of course, spring Two022 will also not be a
typical semester.  If students are back, I assume we'll have more
students than normal or at least more first-year students.

**CSC-207**, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving_ [43] _Data Structures,
and Algorithms_ [44],  has 17 students in Spring One and 22 in Spring
Two.  In a normal semester, we'd talk about trying to balance (and
would likely decide not to).  We'll leave these as is.  We do need
to make sure that none of the Spring-Two students are taking CSC-161
in Spring One.  The switch to terms is not intended to allow students
to accelerate their majors.  And if that is to happen, we want students
to have equal or appropriately prioritized [45] access.  I wish I had
access to class lists.  Oh well, I'll get those on Monday.

**CSC/MAT-208**, _Discrete Structures_, has only nine students.  Students
have to take CSC/MAT-208 or MAT-218 for the major.  Is this a sign that
fewer students are planning a CS major or just that lots want to take
MAT-218?  I wish I knew more about patterns of enrollment here.

**CSC-213**, _Operating Systems and Parallel Algorithms_, has 23 in
Spring One and 37 in Spring Two.  The cap is 24.  When I looked on
Thursday, we had fewer in each section and my main worry was switching
students from Spring Two to Spring One.  Now I'm just worried about
cutting thirteen students from the Spring Two section.  Here's another
case in which I wish I had access to the class lists.  It may be that
there are lots of first-years there, and we can easily cut those [46].

**CSC/PSY/TEC-232**, _Human-Computer Interaction_, has thirty-seven
students for twenty-four slots.  I've already received an email message
from someone who failed to register last night but who had talked to me
about the class and needs it to graduate.  Bleh.  I'm going to consult
with my advisory panel, but my current temptation is to offer a second
section of the course. It's a two-credit course that I plan to have
meet two days per week.  I can have one section meet MW and one meet
TuTh.  That will affect students in CSC-282 when I switch it to another
time, but that's life.  I also have to check with the Dean [47].

**CSC-261**, _Artificial Intelligence_, is over-enrolled by four
students, with 28 students and 24 slots.  We'll cut four students.

**CSC-282**, _Thinking in C and Unix_, has nine students.  It's a
one-credit course.  I could cut it to allow the second section of
HCI.  But I love teaching it, and I haven't offered it in a few
years.  If I add the second section of HCI, I'll probably just
try to switch the time, which may affect some students.  Oh well.

**CSC-301**, _Analysis of Algorithms_, is going to be troublesome.
The Spring One section is over-enrolled by fourteen students (34
enrolled for a class of 20).  The Spring Two section has nine slots.
I expect many factors are in play.  The Spring Two section is an
evening class, and some students are trying to avoid evening classes.
The two faculty also have very different approaches to remote
teaching.  We can't shift students across terms, so we'll need to
cut from the Spring One section and then let them add the Spring Two
section.  Should we close the Spring Two section so that we can manage
shifts, or just do a first-come, first-served approach?  I'd prefer
the former, but I'm a control freak.

**CSC-324**, _Software Design and Development_ has twenty-two 
in Spring One and twenty-two in Spring Two.  That would be a nice
balance, except that the course is supposed to have a cap of sixteen.
And then there's the paired course, **CSC-326**, _Software Design
Leadership_.  That has six students in Spring One and five in Spring
Two.  Another reasonable balance, especially with a cap of six.

But 324 and 326 are a weird pairing, an evolution of our software
design curriculum using a less-than-ideal structure brought on by
Deanly opinions and institutional policies. One of the foci of both
courses is that students work in teams of five (I think) to develop
a large software project for a community partner.  The CSC-326
students are alumni of CSC-324 who return to the class in leadership
positions.  That provides an extra learning opportunity for students
with certain interests and also serves as one of the ways we provide
opportunities for research [48].

Whoops.  Those details may not be important right now.  What's important
is that faculty receive teaching credit for CSC-324 but not for CSC-326.
And the idea was that we'd have twenty students total between CSC-324
and CSC-326.  And there's that issue of teams of five [49].  We'll need
to decide whether we allow both sections to over-enroll and how that
works with projects and team sizes.

**CSC-341**, _Automata, Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity_
has ten students enrolled and a cap of twenty.  I'd hope for a few more
students, but that seems reasonable, particularly for an evening class
that is up against AI.  Maybe some of the students we cut from AI will
switch into 341.

And that's it for my department.  I should send an email message to 
my colleagues [50].

### Cross-term balance issues

On Thursday evening, I started looking at other classes that were likely
to have the issue of needing to balance across terms (see CSC-301).  Why?
Because I hoped that my fellow chairs in departments with similar problems
would have worked out solutions.  Amazingly, most of those problems
resolved themselves the same way as CSC-213.  That is, the section that
looked like it had room filled.  Still, I wonder where things stand.

**STA-209**, _Applied Statistics_, is overenrolled in Spring One (39/36).
In Spring Two, section 1 is incredibly over-enrolled (63/36) and section
2 has only one slot.  That would normally be a situation in which you
find a way to add another section.  But who would teach that?  And
why do we still have classes with a cap of 36 [51]?  Statistics is a
long-term issue at the College.  We've relied on visitors for five
years or more.  We really need to address that issue.

**PSY-113**, _Introduction to Psychology_, is over-enrolled by
twelve students in Spring Two and has eight open slots in Spring
One.  Hmmm ... Both are also at 8:00 a.m.  Did they not get the
memo?  The schedule for morning lab-science courses [52] is awesome.
MWF 8:00 a.m. to 11:50 a.m., TuTh 8:00 a.m. to 11:15 a.m.  I had
at least one Tutorial student look at that and say "Um, I don't think
I'll take lab science this year."  

But I was supposed to be writing about balancing.  It's Psychology.
I wonder if they run experiments to decide who gets to switch.  And
even if students switch, there aren't enough total slots.  Who gets
prioritized?  I'd prioritize first-years, who are prospective majors.

As long as we're on the subject of Psychology, it appears that
**PSY-248**, _Abnormal Psychology_, is over-enrolled by three
students, section 1 of **PSY-495**, _Senior Seminar_, is over-enrolled
by three students, and section 2 of PSY-495 is over-enrolled by
four students.  In Spring 2, **PSY-232**, _Human Computer Interaction_,
is over-enrolled by thirteen students and *PSY-345** Psychopharmacology,
is over-enrolled by seven.  I'm amazed that we offer Psychopharmacology
at all; I have nightmares about Grinnell students experimenting on
each other or using it as a first step in creating their own
substances [53].

I assume that they find three students to cut from Abnormal.  I
wonder if it's normal to cut from Abnormal.  I assume they allow
Senior Seminar to over-enroll.  What's the alternative?  "Sorry,
there wasn't room for you in Senior Seminar.  I guess you won't
graduate." I've covered HCI already, since it's cross-listed with
CS.  And Psychopharm?  I have no idea.  I assume they push students
to other psych courses, which have a bit of space.

Returning to other courses that need cross-term balancing,I see
that the Spring Two section of PHI-111 is over-enrolled by sixteen
students (41/25) and the Spring One section has four open slots.
That's much more of a gap than I recall from Thursday night [54].
It's good to see Philosophy getting more popular.  I wonder who they
will keep, who they will cut, and how they will shift.

Chemistry and Biological Chemistry have an interesting pairing of
what were cross-term balancing needs.  On Thursday evening, I saw
that BCM-262 was over-enrolled in Spring Two with space in Spring
One and CHM-222 was over-enrolled in Spring One with space in Spring
Two.  That makes some sense, as CHM-222 is officially a prerequisite
for BCM-262.  But the search schedule of courses info for BCM-262
in Spring One does say "Students may take the prerequisite for BCM-262
of CHM222 in S1 or S2, but if they want to take CHM222 in S2, they
need to contact the Registrar to get permission."  I wonder why
there are two sections of CHM-222 in Spring Two rather than Spring One.
Probably because of other restrictions on faculty time.  And didn't
we decide to use "Spring 1" and "Spring 2" rather than "S1" and "S2"?
There's an accessibility issue at play---"F" and "S" sound almost
identical for those of us with high-end hearing loss.  Plus, "F1"
sounds too much like that thing Trump tried to eliminate.

Where do things stand now? [55]  The Spring One section of BCM-262
has five available slots.  The Spring Two section of BCM-262 is
over-enrolled by ten students.  The Spring One section of CHM-222
is over-enrolled by a whopping twenty-one students while the Spring
Two sections have thirteen and four slots, respectively.  And it's
not the instructors.  That chemist with a theme song and traditionally
high enrollments is teaching both terms.

These are chemists.  They don't like to cut students.  I assume
that they'll encourage students to switch between semesters and
permit a bit of over-enrollment.  Or will that work with labs?  I
don't know.  It may depend on whether or not we can have in-person
labs.  But I expect that most students will survive.

Is that it for the balancing issues?  I think so.  Good luck to
everyone who has to deal with these!

### Classics

While I was looking at the balancing issues above, I saw that another
[Monessa Cummins](monessa-cummins) course was over-enrolled.  Which one?
**CLS-250**, _Roman Archaeology and Art_.  But it's over-enrolled by
only seven students.  You'd think that one of the top faculty in
America would get more [56].

I wonder how the rest of Classics is doing, particularly given the
snarky comments about Classics yesterday's otherwise excellent speaker
gave.  What was it, "If the Humanities aren't careful, we'll end up
like Classics" [58]?  I thought Classics was one of the Humanities . 

Let's see ... **LAT-222**, _Intermediate Latin_, has fifteen students.
That's pretty good, especially since rumor has it that our Elementary
[59] Latin course covers what other schools cover in two semesters.
**LAT-395**, _ST: Plautus_, only has six.  I wonder what the prereqs
are.  **GRE-222**, _Intermediate Greek_, has seven.  Not as good
as Latin.  Not as good as 100 years ago at Grinnell.  But not bad.
And I'd expect that all of those students plan to major.  **GRE-303**,
Greek Drama, has fourteen.  Cool.  Let's hope that the students
didn't misread the title and think that it's a course on "Geek
Drama" [60,61].  **CLS-395**, _ST: Greek Ethical Thought_, has
eleven.  Not bad for a 300-level seminar!  But why are some Greek
courses *GRE* and some *CLS*?  I suppose I should know.  And what's
the relationship between the Classics and Careers, Life, and Service?
Ah, maybe that's how you get more people into the Classics [62].
Another Classics special topic, **CLS-395**, _ST: Indo-Euro Poetry
& Myth_, has thirteen.  A nice, healthy seminar size.  Finally,
**CLS-495**, the Senior Seminar, has nine.  That's a good size.

I shouldn't be surprised at the health of our Classics department.
They are awesome faculty.

### Shakespeare and Film Studies

Remember these?  They are the ones I classify as traditionally
over-enrolled classes.  That's in part because I look back to my
days at the UofC when Shakespeare with Bevington and Film with Mast
were the classes people camped out for in Chicago's strange variant
of first-come, first-served.  (You camped out to set up appointments
with your advisor.  After that, it was FCFS.  So there were two
factors: How many students your advisor had who wanted early
appointments and how quickly you could make the appointment with
your advisor.)  But Shakespeare with Garrison is also an over-enrolled
class, and I'd expect it to be more so because he'll be off at the
Newberry [64] in Fall 2021 [65].  Film Studies has not been a regular
class, but with the addition of a new position in Film and a potential
concentration in Media Studies, I hope it will be.

Strangely enough, there are still three open spaces in the Spring
1 section of Garrison's _Introduction to Shakespeare_.  Why is that
strange?  Because I'm used to seeing Garrison classes, particularly
Shakespeare, over-enrolled by a factor of two.  But there are four
sections of Shakespeare this year, if we include Garrison's 
**ENG-195**, _ST: Shakespeare Behind Bars_, which is over-enrolled
by three and has a larger cap (25) than the normal intro (20).
I was going to suggest that students were thinking about the bars
that serve alcohol [66], but then the class would see more enrollment.
Perhaps 85 slots in Shakespeare per year, rather than 40, would
regularly satisfy demand.

**ART-195**, _ST: Intro to Film Studies_, is over-enrolled by about
a factor of two, with 39 students in a class capped at 20.  Poor
Prof. Tavares; while it's great to have that much interest in your
discipline, it's awful to have to tell students "no".  There is
room in **ART-295**, _ST: Fundamentals of Video Production_, so
perhaps some students can study film through making.  I see that
there are also twenty-seven students in **GWS-295**, _ST: Trans
Film and Media_, suggesting interest in both film and a particular
context for film.  The class is capped at 30 (*why?*), so all of
the students will get to be there.  In any case, I see student
demand for the Media Studies concentration.  Let's hope that once
things settle down, we see forward progress on that [67].

### English

Looking at Shakespeare and Film got me thinking about English.
Let's see how things stand there.  In Spring One, there seem to be
five over-enrolled courses: **ENG-120**, _Literary Analysis_ (there's
space in the early-morning section); **ENG-195**, _Poetry and
Performance_; **ENG-206**, _The Craft of Poetry_ (regularly
over-enrolled), **ENG-329**, _Studies in African American Literature_;
and **ENG-390**, _Literary Theory_.  Literary Theory, in particular,
is over-enrolled by nine students.  What was someone saying about
the death of the humanities?  Not here.

What else do I see in Spring One?  I see Ralph is teaching a special
topic on Neurohumanities [68].  It has strong enrollment.  I've seen
the titles a few times, but I hadn't realized that we had regular
courses on _Reading & Writing Youth Culture_ and _Feminism and
Difference_.  Both sound interesting.  

I'm surprised that Ralph's _Craft of Creative Nonfiction_ doesn't
have more students.  Although you may not be able to tell it from
this musing, I learned a lot in that class.  Perhaps it's that it's
at 8:00 a.m. [69]. Perhaps it's because students don't know what
to make of a 2.0-credit version of the course.  My assumption was
that it was split between terms, but the enrollment is not the same
in each term, so maybe not.  Or maybe our system just can't handle
such issues.

And that brings us to Spring Two.  Or at least it brings us to
English in Spring Two.  There's another over-enrolled section of
**ENG-120**, _Literary Analysis_, but there's also another section
with space.  I've already mentioned that **ENG-195**, _Shakespeare
Behind Bars_, is over-enrolled.  Another 195 course, **ENG-195**,
_Introduction to Freelance Journalism_, is also overenrolled (28/20).
If there's that much demand for the course, I wonder if we could
get someone in the College community to teach it regularly [71].
**ENG-231**, _American Literary Traditions III_, is over-enrolled
by a whopping sixteen students (41/25).  And, once again, **ENG-390**,
_Literary Theory_, is over-enrolled by nine students.  Oh, that's
because it's split between terms.

I wonder what English is going to do about that over-enrollment in
Literary Theory.

Beyond that?  These enrollments seem pretty good.  What's that about
the death of the humanities?  It's good to see them living on here.

### Other Humanities

On that note, I should look at other Humanities.  Since the rest
of the world classifies History as one of the core humanistic
disciplines, I suppose I should look there next.  One really small
enrollment course, and it's an upper-level 300-course with an
"arranged" time".  The rest look fairly solid.  **HIS-295**, _ST:
Foundations of US Popular Culture_, is over-enrolled by nine students
(34/25).  **HIS-223**, _Health & Medicine in American History_, is
over-enrolled by twelve students (37/25).  **HIS-295**, _ST:
Surveillance in Modern History**, is over-enrolled by two (27/25).
**HIS-327**, _The Civil Rights Movement_, is over-enrolled by seven
(19/12).

Conveniently, our **HUM** prefix falls right after history.
**HUM-101**, _Humanities I: The Ancient Greek World_, is over-enrolled
by eight (28/20).  The special topics in the general humanities
are less strong, but that may be because it's hard to advertise
these kinds of courses.

Well, that's about as far as my attention span will go today.  There
are too many humanistic disciplines to look at them all and still 
finish this musing in a reasonable amount of time [73].  I'm not even
going to look at what's happening in Studio Art (always a popular
topic) or Theatre and Dance (one of my favorite departments).

### Mathematics and Statistics

But that doesn't mean I won't look at my former home department before
giving up on this musing.  How is Math/Stats doing?

It appears that Mathematics chose an interesting strategy for
multi-section courses.  Unlike CS, which increased enrollments in
individual sections but cut total sections, Math seems to have
followed what I think of as "The Econ Strategy" for spring: In many
cases, both sections of a course are taught by the same faculty
member and are offered at the same time [74].  That leads to
some interesting pairing.  For example, Section 1 of **MAT-133**,
_Calculus II_, in Spring One, is over-enrolled by nine people, while
Section 2, offered at exactly the same time and with the same
instructor, has thirty-one open slots.  Something similar happens
with Calc II in Spring Two: Section 2 has twenty-two slots,
while section 1 is over-enrolled by eleven [75].

What else do I see in Math?  **MAT-218**, _Graph Theory_ (Spring
One), is slightly over-enrolled, while **MAT-218**, _Elementary
Number Theory_ (Spring Two), has some open spaces.  I missed this
issue when I was looking at cross-term balancing.  I suppose that
has to happen here.  I wonder if Math will check for prospective
CS majors and prioritize them for the Graph Theory version of
MAT-218 [76].

Ah!  Here's what I had recalled.  Spring Two brings way too
much over-enrollment in 300-level courses.  **MAT-316**,
_Foundations of Analysis_, is over-enrolled by three (23/20).
**MAT-321**, _Foundations of Abstract Algebra_, is over-enrolled
by seven (27/20).  **MAT-322**, _Computational Algebraic
Geometry_, is over-enrolled by fifteen (27/12).  I don't envy
the department in figuring out those issues.

Of course, there is a member of the department who taught Tutorial
and a moderately large course (28 students) in Fall One while also
chairing two important committees [79].  Maybe they'll take on
an overload [80].

### Some other over-enrolled courses

I'm running out of energy.  I'm going to call out a few more
courses and then call it a day, or at least a musing.

**POL-219**, _Constitutional Law and Politics_ (Spring One), is
over-enrolled by a whopping thirty-four students (59/25), which may
be the high this year.  I don't think it's ever over-enrolled by
that much, even when the legendary Ira Strauber taught it.  Congrats
PH!  I wonder if the popularity is due to our students' experience
with a president who doesn't seem to have read the constitution
[81].  I do see that **POL-395**, _Democratic Decline_ is also
over-enrolled, although not by nearly as much.

**HUM-195**, _ST: I/Robot_ (Spring One), is over-enrolled by thirty
students (60/30).  It's not a surprise.  It's a cool and timely
topic.  It's one of the most popular faculty members at the College
[82], who is also writing a book on the topic.  I just hope Karla
keeps in the CS majors, who will benefit highly from thinking about
the implications of their work [83].  I also wonder if there's a
way we can slowly steal Karla over to our department.  Teach her a
little CS.  Add more required and optional courses in CS and Society.
Boost her pay.  It could be awesome.  And Sociology already has its
share of amazing faculty [84].

**BIO-375**, _Principles of Pharmacology_ (Spring One), is over-enrolled by
twenty-one students (33/12).  I have the same worries about this
course that I have about Psychopharmacology.  But students haven't
been arrested yet.  Anyway, I wonder where Bio will move
those students.  Other Spring-One 300-level classes also seem
to be over-enrolled (20/12 in **BIO-365**, _Microbiology_ and
20/12 in **BIO-395**, _ST: Ornithology_).

**BIO-345**, _Advanced Genetics_ (Spring Two), is over-enrolled by
nineteen students (31/12).  It's always over-enrolled by about nineteen
students.  We need another geneticist [85].  I assume they have a
plan for BIO-345 over-enrolling, but I also think the normal plan
involves Vida teaching extra students and, given the extra workload
associated with being faculty chair, I don't think she should take
on that load.  I also assume that, given the need for social
distancing, if this is offered in person there's no way to
expand the labs.

**ENV-145**, _Nations and the Global Environment_ (Spring One), is
over-enrolled by eighteen students.  It's always over-enrolled.
It has David Campbell.  I'd take the class if I could.  (Hmmm ...
maybe I'll add it to my list of courses to take the next time I
take courses.)

**CHM-129**, _General Chemistry_ (Spring Two), is over-enrolled by
sixteen students.  That seems to be enough for another section.
But who would teach it?  I don't think our Dean has the time.

**SOC-395**, _ST: Regimes and Resistance_, is over-enrolled by
fourteen students.  It sounds like a great topic, particularly
given the state of our country [86].

**CHM-363**, _Physical Chemistry I_, (Spring One) is over-enrolled
by twelve students (28/16).  That seems like another case in which
another section is needed.  One can be a Dean and teach, right?

**PCS-101**, _Introduction to Peace and Conflict Studies_, is
over-enrolled by ten (35/25).  I'm not surprised.  It's a particularly
important topic.  It has a popular teacher (see SOC-395 above).
And some portion of Grinnell students probably interpret **PCS**
as "Pharmacological Studies" [87].

I feel a bit bad about leaving out those whose courses are "only"
over-enrolled by single digits, particularly since many sound
really interesting [88].  But I have to stop somewhere.

### A few other things

It appears that it's harder to stop than I thought it would be.  A
few more notes that came up along the way

I'm amused that **ENV-240**, _Environmental Chemistry_, is listed
as blank over blank ( / ).  But I see that it also appears in Chemistry
(7/24).

This may be the first time in recent memory that **PHE-202**,
_Coaching Methods_, is not over-enrolled.  I wonder whether that's
because students are worried about the lack of in-person opportunities.

I'm surprised at how large some of the special topics courses are.
I generally think of holding special topics courses at lower caps
because they are new topics that require extra effort, but I see
a lot of fairly large special topics classes, including _I/Robot_
and _Shakespeare in Bars_ [89].

How do we have _Bowling_ this spring?  And why did I forget about
it?  Bowling is one of my favorite classes.  I enroll every chance
I have.  But I scheduled my classes this spring.  We also seem
to have _Rock Climbing_, _Indoor Soccer_, _Beginning_, and
more.  Wellness is great (and something I encourage all of my
advisees to consider), but can we really do in-person courses?

Why are only eleven students enrolled in **PHI-101**, _Logic_?  Do
prospective lawyers no longer come to Grinnell?  Or perhaps I should
say "Only eleven students are enrolled in logic.  That explains
so much." [90]

Well, that's what I have for this preregistration period.  I'll
see you again in the spring for the individually-advised-registration
period [93,95,97].

---

[1] It's almost like I didn't take _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_ [2].

[2] Sorry Ralph!

[3] The traditional sleep study question: "How long does it take you to
fall asleep after your head hits the pillow."  My answer, during the week,
during the day (which is when I'm most tired)?  "About a minute."

[4] I dreamt that I was an adjunct in a time of Covid.  Academicians 
will understand.

[5] If I ever have time to restart regular musing, I'll write about the
mastery learning model I borrowed/adapted from one of my colleagues.

[6] As I've said, I both respect and sympathize with the ITS staff.  But
institutional technology policies, which may not come from ITS, cause
endless problems.

[7] I inherited this one.  I probably won't get it done until winter
break.  _C'est la vie_.

[8] That link requires sign.  Also, as you will soon learn, it may
disappear before the end of the year.  And I bet it doesn't get archived
on archive.org.

[9] Interestingly, individual learning also includes small group learning.

[10] On a positive note, when I've talked to ITS staff about my use cases,
they've been good at thinking through how they can support those use cases
in the new system.

[11] At least I recall her saying that.

[12] Well, one reader asked.  But they are an influential reader.

[14] That's not quite true.  I enjoy writing for CSC 151 and I've been
doing a lot of that.  Perhaps "I haven't had enough chance to write
non-pedagogical materials for fun."  That also cuts out the fun writing
I did about the primacy of LOLcats in a modern liberal education, which
was mostly as a template for my Tutorial students [15].

[15] It took me a week or two to learn that the current generation of
first-year college students knows as little about LOLcats as I did when
they were popular.

[16] This endnote is a placeholder for what I decide to do.  I wonder
if I'll remember to fill it in

[17] A course that was popular at my _alma mater_ when I was an undergraduate
and is usually as popular at Grinnell

[18] The same.

[19] Only an issue in recent years.  And perhaps three decades ago.

[20] Officially, it's an "individually advised curriculum".  But that
name is long.  And most of the other schools that have this kind of 
curriculum call it an "open curriculum".  So I'm sticking with that.  Tenure
is a wonderful thing [21].

[21] See the nightmare that opened this piece.

[22] In reality, we pretend that there are caps of 100, which ends up being
mostly the same thing.

[23] Well, students pre-register.  Or maybe students open register.

[24] In case anyone is reading this in the far future [25], 2020-21
was a time of a pandemic.  Grinnell decided that in-person classes were
not safe for Fall One and that any classes offered in person for the rest
of the year needed to have significant social distancing.

[25] Not that that will happen. [26]

[26] Yes, Grammarly, I do intend to write "that" twice in a row.

[27] Not by vote of the faculty.

[28] I prefer the term "semisemester".  My first-year students call
them "quarters".  Since we have four during the academic year and may
have one during the summer "fifths" might be better.  Perhaps "quinticeps".
I'll need to check with a classicist [29].

[29] While looking for a good Latinate form, I discovered "quintate", which,
while not an appropriate term for a semisemester, does echo the real meaning
of "decimate".  When we quintate, we remove one fifth, just as when we
decimate, we remove one tenth.  At least if we take the terms seriously.

[30] In some cases, two-and-a-half or three-and-a-half courses.

[31] I'm not a big fan of the idea of two-course terms; it strikes me
as a much bigger teaching load than we're accustomed to, particularly
given the other aspects of online seven-week courses.  Perhaps that's
a topic for another musing [32].

[32] If I ever have time to restart musing.

[33] That may change.  Read on, Dear Reader.

[34] Because the CS department has a large number of students who currently
reside in a time zone about 12--14 hours ahead of the U.S., we tried to make
sure that one section of every multi-section course was offered at either
8:00 a.m. Central time or 7:00 p.m. Central time.

[35] The pairing may actually support students who want to work during
the day.  I hope that not too many of our students need to work full-time
day jobs.  The recent switch of most loans to grants may help.

[36] Or perhaps their technology is such that only asynchronous classes work.

[37] Scary, isn't it?

[38] I still don't have answers to my questions of "For whom?" and "For what
grade?"

[39] On the other hand, my students in the remote intro studio course are
raving about the awesome set of supplies Grinnell sent to them.  I'm glad
I'm at an institution that considers it appropriate to provide supplies rather
than to force students to purchase them.

[40] Including endnotes.

[41] Fewer students enrolled.

[42] Don't worry, we paired that with a way of cutting other kinds of faculty
workload.

[43] Do you notice a naming pattern here?

[44] With variation!

[45] E.g., we should prioritize second-year students intending CS majors
over first-year students.

[46] Sorry first-years.  But you would not normally get to take CSC-213 in
the spring.

[48] We consider this a form of Boyer's "Scholarship of Practice".  I have
a musing on these issues somewhere, but I'm too lazy to find it today.

[49] Or is it teams of four?  I think we've used both.

[50] Done.  I also included the SEPC.

[51] Since I capped the fall sections of CSC-151 at 36, I probably
should not ask such questions.

[52] And Studio Art courses, I believe.

[53] I'm joking.  There is no need to write to me to defend the course
or to claim that I am mistaken about Grinnell students.

[54] I forgot to write down the numbers.

[55] No, not for the presidency or F-1 Visas.  For these courses.

[56] Sorry MC [57]!

[57] I really want to refer to Monessa as "MC-Cubed", envisioning
her spinning the platters.  MC Monessa Cummins, Master of Classics.

[58] He also said something about choosing catchier names for
courses.  Should our introduction to classical Greek become "It's
all Greek to me?"

[59] I always think of it as "LMN-try".

[60] I apologize to my classical colleagues for the joke.

[61] Does Buffy count as Geek Drama?  Firefly?  The original Star Trek?
Napoleon Dynamite?  Am I now too old to figure it out?

[62] Apologies again to MC-Cubed, W-Joe, Angelo, and Dustin.  Probably
Anne [63], too, even though she's no longer here.

[63] No, not President Harris.

[64] I keep wanting to spell it "Newbury" because of the bookstore(s) I
used to frequent on Newbury Street.

[65] At least I hope he can be off at the Newberry, even though I'll
miss him.  He'll make a great director for the ACM Newberry program.  

[66] A wonderful place to study Shakespeare.

[67] I'm also fairly out of it.  It may be that the concentration has
already been proposed and approved.

[68] It's listed as "Neurohumanties".  Perhaps it's about ties between
humans and neuroscience.

[69] Yes, Ralph, I recall your story about teaching at 8:00 a.m.  You're
a better man than I [70].

[70] And now I'm hearing that Yardbirds song in my head.

[71] Didn't our Debate Team coach do journalism and write a book
about writing, or something like that? [72]

[72] Should I stop advocating or referencing for individuals in my
musings?  I'm not sure.  Opinions welcome!

[73] I've already far exceeded "a reasonable amount of team".

[74] I will say that these are among the strategies necessary to survive
teaching remotely during accelerated terms.  Without some sort of
adjustment, many of us would burn out.  I know I would.

[75] Is it a sign of a mental defect that I'm happy that "II", "2",
"Two", and "two" all appear in this sentence?

[76] For those surprised that we have the same number for what sound
like very different topics, and for those who took MAT-218 back when
it was entitled _Combinatorics_, there's a lot of back story here.
The short version is: MAT-218 is officially _Discrete Bridges to
Advanced Mathematics_.  Like MAT-222, which I think of as _Continuous
Bridges to Advanced Mathematics_ but appears to be called only
_Bridges to Advanced Mathematics_, it's intended to connects the
basic curriculum in mathematics to the advanced curriculum.  What
do students need in that bridge [77]?  A deep understanding of proof
and proof techniques, the experience of having delved more deeply
into a coherent particular theory, and other things I forget.  While
we figure that CS majors who learn some discrete field get enough related
topics that they can handle the math in CS, we prefer that they choose
bridges more relevant fields, like Graph Theory.

[77] Apparently not continuity [78].

[78] That was a joke about "discrete" vs "continuous".

[79] And you thought I had problems with taking on too much work.

[80] No!  Don't!

[81] As well as some incoming congresscritters.  "We have a tripartite
government: the house, the senate, and the church.  No, the house,
the senate, and the executive.  Something like that."

[82] Hi Karla!

[83] Hint, hint.

[84] I hope that folks feel that CS does, too.  I'm certainly proud
of my colleagues.

[85] I have no idea if Bio wants another geneticist.  But I do know
that Advanced Genetics always over-enrolls by a huge amount.

[86] Did I say that already?

[87] Have I done that one to death yet?

[88] Lots of courses seem interesting.  That's traditionally another
musing.

[89] Whoops.  _Shakespeare Behind Bars_.  At least it's not
_Shakespearean Pharmacology_.

[90] I should probably watch my sarcasm.  Oh well, it's too late now [91].

[91] I've learned my lesson well.  You see, you can't please everyone.
So you've got to please yourself. [92]

[92] Am I alone in finding that random song lyrics pop into my head
when I'm writing or saying something?  And that some are wrong?
Because the preface to that previous endnote should be "It's all
right now."

[93] Whoo!  I made it over ninety endnotes [94].  I should try to end before
100.

[94] At one point, that was endnote 93.  And I'm now in a quandry.
If I add "Made it" as an endnote to "100", then I'll be at 100,
thereby violating the endnote.  I suppose I could at "Failed".  I'll
just leave things as they are.

[95] Did I hyphenate that correctly?  I usually don't hyphenate
adverb-adjective pairs [96], but that seemed necessary.

[96] That one was correctly hyphenated.

[97] I do hope that I will find time to muse again before the next
preregistration period [98].  However, given how long this one took
[99], I'm not sure that I can count on that.

[98] Or whatever we call it.

[99] About seven hours, give or take.

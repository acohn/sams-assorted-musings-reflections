Live music
==========

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

On Thanksgiving, I posted [a list of things for which I am
thankful](thanksgiving-2018).  Somewhere in the middle of the list was
"live music".  While I haven't made it to all the live music I'd hoped
[1], I've made it to a reasonable variety of music recently.

On Saturday the 8th, I saw [Squirrel
Flower's](https://squirrelflower.bandcamp.com/) last concert in
Grinnell before she heads off on her European tour [2].  She opened
up for [Elizabeth Moen](https://elizabethmoen.com/).  There was a
lot to appreciate about both parts of the show.  I'll admit that
I was particularly struck by the covers both did.  Ella did a great
not-quite-acoustic cover of Springsteen's "Tougher Than the Rest";
I wish I'd thought to record it.  Moen and her band did a wonderfully
rockin' version of Simon and Garfunkel's "Kathy's Song" [3].  I know I
can't see Ella any time soon, but Moen's based in Iowa City, so perhaps
there's a chance to see her [4].

On Sunday the 9th, the [Grinnell Singers](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/music/ensembles/grinnell-singers), the Oratorio Society,
and some guest musicians presented [Considering Matthew
Shepard](https://conspirare.org/project/considering-matthew-shepard/).
It's definitely a moving work.  There are many highlights, but one thing
I particularly appreciated was seeing the guest vocalist shake hands
with a local student.  I wonder which parts the Singers will do on their 
spring tour.

On Monday the 10th, the high school had its annual winter concert, with
both the band and choirs performing.  It's hard to believe that it's the
tenth such concert I've attended and that it's the last one in which a
Rebelsky child will perform [5].  For the past few years, I've worried
that "Sleigh Ride" would feel trite after so many listenings.  But I
still enjoy the piece.  It's not so much the nostalgia as the arrangement.
I also enjoyed seeing one of the percussionists swaying to the music.

Here's looking forward to more live music in the near and far future [6]!

[1] Among other things, I missed the Collegium concert of about two
weeks ago, the Jazz band concert a week or so ago, Richard Thompson last
Monday night (conflict with HS concert), the carols at noon last Tuesday
(meeting), and Kris Delmhorst last Wednesday night (too tired to drive
back from CR afterwards).

[2] I'm pretty sure that she's graduating during that time, too.

[3] Browsing her [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-1ZUnL0QOGPqIrnFhJ6ixA), I see that she does a variety of
covers from time to time.  Or at least she has both "[Don't Let Me
Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kbbr5gvA6E)" and "[True Love Will Find You In The End](https://www.facebook.com/elizabethmoenmusic/videos/1100058720134667/)" posted in various places.

[4] She's playing the Mill on December 21.  Unfortunately, that's the same
night as the College holiday party.  The holiday party wins.

[5] Maybe in a few decades, a Rebelsky grandchild will perform.

[6] And here's looking forward to having time and energy to attend!

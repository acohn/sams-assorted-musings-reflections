Preregistration for fall 2018
=============================

_Topics/tags: [Registration](index-registration), [Grinnell](index-grinnell)_

For some reason, I find myself compelled to look at enrollment numbers
at the end of each preregistration period.  You can read a bit more about
Grinnell's interesting approach to preregistration in [my comments on
preregistration for spring 2017](prereg-2017S) and [my comments on
preregistration for fall 2017](prereg-2017F) [1].  In short: Although
courses have listed caps, we allow students to "register" for the courses
even after the cap is filled and we do not distinguish between students
who enroll early and those who enroll late.  After all the students
preregister [2], we figure out who to cut to get courses down to the
appropriate size.  I know that it's not an ideal system.  For example,
it likely prioritizes students who have the know-how or social capital
to contact faculty and say "I realize that your class is likely to be
over-enrolled; here are reasons I hope that you will keep me in the
class."  It also prioritizes students who know how to "play" the system
[3].  But it's the system we have.

Where was I?

Oh, that's right.  At the end of each preregistration period, I like to see
where numbers stand.  It gives me a better sense of what I should talk to
my advisees about in the future [4].  It also feeds my general desire for
exploring data.  Of course, preregistration for the fall is hard because
the incoming students have not yet registered for courses.

So, let's see what patterns we can identify in the preregistration data.
You can look at the [current registration data](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/) if you'd like.  I'm looking at the data as of
Friday, 27 April 2018.

We'll start with over-enrolled courses.

* Katya Gibel Mevorach has 18 students in American Studies 305, _Cultural
  Politics of Fashion_, which is capped at 15.  If I recall correctly,
  that course usually over-enrolls [5].  I'm not sure whether Katya will
  keep all 18 or cut.  Interestingly, American Studies 245, which Katya
  is also teaching, is under-enrolled.  Does time have something to do
  with it?  Cultural Politics of Fashion is in the odd slot of 7:00 p.m.
  to 9:50 p.m. on Monday nights.  American Studies 245 is 1:00 p.m. to
  3:50 p.m. on Monday and Wednesday, which makes it a six-hour-per-week
  course.
* Tess Kultad's Anthropology Special Topic on _Health, Inequality, and
  Social Justice_ is over-enrolled by 9.  I would expect that to be a
  particularly popular topic.
* Section 2 of Art 111, _Introduction to the Studio_ is over-enrolled by
  six.  I assume that they will cut some of those and switch some to
  the other section, which has two slots.  But will they drop more to
  leave some room for first-year students?  Will some students naturally
  migrate to the not-yet-announced 100-level course on filmmaking?
* Art 134, _Drawing_, is over-enrolled by twenty-two students.  That's
  more than a full section.  I wonder if the department will find a
  way to offer a second section.
* Section 1 of the lab for _Introduction to Biological Chemistry_ is
  over-enrolled by 2 students.  But there is room in the other lab section.
  I assume they'll balance that if they can.  Unfortunately, lab section 2
  is Friday 1:00-3:50 which is both an unpopular time for students and a
  time that conflicts with many MWF afternoon classes.
* Section 1 of Biology 251, _Molecules, Cells, and Organisms_ is over-enrolled
  by 5, section 3 is over-enrolled by 4, and section 5 is over-enrolled
  by 2.  There are 3 slots available in section 2 and 10 in section 4.
  They should be able to shuffle those and keep everyone in the course.
* There are a few courses that are over-enrolled by 1.  I'm not going to
  mention those.
* Biology 380, _Molecular Biology_ is over-enrolled by eight students.
  If I recall correctly, that's a hard class to expand because it includes
  lab time.  Will students switch to another 300-level class?  I'm not
  sure.
* Section 2 of Chemistry 221, _Organic Chemistry I_ is over-enrolled by
  17 students and section 3 is over-enrolled by 20.  There are nine slots
  left between the other two sections.  That leaves, um, 28 students
  unaccounted for.  Will Chemistry add another lecture section or just
  a few more labs?  I'm not sure [6].  Why so much demand for Organic
  Chemistry?  I assume that's associated with our large number of
  Biological Chemistry majors.
* The one section of Physical Chemistry I is over-enrolled by nine students.
  Will they keep those students? If so, they'll need to add another lab
  section.  And there's only one section of PChemI in the spring, so they
  may need to let it be a bit larger.
* Monessa Cummins' Classics/History 257, _The Roman Republic_ is
  over-enrolled by 12 students.  That's usually where Monessa's classes
  stand.  Few faculty are better at teaching writing than Monessa.  There
  are also many other things that make her stand out as a faculty member.
* Section 2 of Computer Science 207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving,
  Data Structures, and Algorithms_ is over-enrolled by 11.  We have nine
  slots available in section 1.  I'm guessing that we'll allow each to
  over-enroll slightly.  But students who did not preregister probably
  won't be able to get in.
* Section 1 of CSC 211, _Computing Organization and Architecture_ is
  over-enrolled by nine.  But there are ten slots in section 2.  We should
  be able to balance those.  I do worry what will happen with the one
  section of CSC 213 in the spring.
* CSC 324, _Software Design and Development_ is over-enrolled by six
  students.  We'll need to figure out how many of those we can keep;
  the structure of the class makes it hard to keep that many.
* Economics/Policy Studies 220, _Foundations of Policy Analysis_ is
  over-enrolled by five.  I don't know how Econ and Policy Studies
  cut students, but I expect that they will cut some [7].
* Economics 240, _Resource and Environmental Economics_, is over-enrolled
  by fourteen students.  I feel like that's a common occurrence, but I
  don't see a note to that effect in my past musings.  I wonder if it
  wasn't offered last year.
* Section 2 of Economics 282, Macroeconomic Analysis_ is over-enrolled
  by five students.  But there are twelve slots available in section 1.
  I assume that Econ can balance those two sections.
* Unsurprisingly, Economics 327, _Corporate Finance_ is over-enrolled
  by twelve students.  Why is that not surprising?  because Economics
  is a popular major, because Finance is a popular topic, and because
  it wasn't offered this year [8].  I know that many of my dual CS/Econ
  majors were looking forward to it.
* English 206, _The Craft of Poetry_, is over-enrolled by eleven students.
  Who wouldn't want to study poetry with the legendary Ralph Savarese?
  I expect that English will have an interesting challenge in that
  Ralph's English 207, _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_, has nine slots.
  Will they still offer that class and encourage the prospective poets
  to switch, or will they ask Ralph to switch topics?  If it were me,
  I'd keep _Craft of Creative Nonfiction_.
* English 224, _Traditions of English Literature II_ is over-enrolled by
  four students.  I assume that some of the students in that course will
  have to find another course.
* English 310, _Studies in Shakespeare_, is over-enrolled by eight
  students.  That's a challenge to deal with since it's an upper-level
  seminar that students likely need and it's not something that others
  can teach.  So, even though English 360, _Seminar in Postcolonial
  Literature_, is under-enrolled, there's not really a magic switch that
  can happen, or at least I assume that there's not.
* Global Development Studies 320, _Applied Policy Analysis_ is
  over-enrolled by three.  What will Monty do?  I assume that it will
  depend, a bit, on whether the students are policy studies concentrators.
* History 222, _Women in American History_ is over-enrolled by seven.
  History 223, _Health and Medicine in American History_ is over-enrolled
  by six.  Carolyn will need to cut those two courses down to their caps
  if she is to survive the semester.
* Section 1 of Mathematics 215, _Linear Algebra_, is over-enrolled by
  fifteen students.  There are only nine slots available in section 2.
  That's going to be a hard class to cut, as most students need it
  for their Mathematics major or their Computer Science major [9].
  The course is now in that weird zone in which there don't feel like
  quite enough students to offer another section, yet it's more than
  you can really support in the current sections.  Nonetheless, two
  over-enrolled sections is a lot.  I feel sorry for my student who was
  hoping to add the course late.
* Mathematics 321, _Foundations of Abstract Algebra_, is over-enrolled
  by four students.
* Music 120-01, _Performance: Violin_ is over-enrolled by four students.
  But Nancy Gaub normally takes only two students.  I see that there
  are slots with the other violin teachers.
* Music 120-02, _Performance: Voice_ is over-enrolled by six students.
  Lisa Henderson normally takes twenty-two students.  Music 120-13,
  _Performance: Voice_, is over-enrolled by nine students.  Nicholas
  Miguel normally takes only ten.  There are some slots in Suzanne
  Lommler's voice section and in a section with an unknown instructor
  [10].  It looks like Henderson has a few slots in the _Performance:
  Advanced Voice_, so perhaps she'll switch around. Or maybe the advanced
  sections are mis-capped, since the caps all seem to be twenty.
* Section 1 of the _Modern Physics Lab_ is over-enrolled by three.
  But there are enough slots in the other two sections to make up for it.
* Political Science 257, _Nationalism_, is over-enrolled by five.
  I assume a few students will be asked to switch to other Political
  Science classes.
* Johanna Meehan's Political Science special topics course on _Reading
  Arendt_ is over-enrolled by six.  It makes me feel good that so many
  students want to take that course.  But I'm not sure how Johanna will
  deal with the issue.
* Policy  Studies 320, _Applied Policy Analysis_, is over-enrolled
  by three.  That's one of those courses that all concentrators need and
  that few people who are not concentrators are likely to take.  I assume
  Doug will allow it to over-enroll by a bit, but I could be wrong.
* Sociology 265, _Sociology of Health and Illness_ is over-enrolled
  by fifteen.  Are you seeing a pattern?  Every course on health seems
  to over-enroll.  That's one of the reasons that the Technology Studies
  concentration is evolving into a concentration in Science, Health,
  and Society.
* Sharon Quinsaat's Sociology special topics on _Mass Media and
  Society_ is over-enrolled by five.
* Spanish 312, _Women and Gender in Spanish Literature_ is over-enrolled
  by fifteen students.  I wonder if they'll relieve Mirzam of an
  introductory course to allow her to teach two sections.  I *think*
  that's what I'd try to do.
* Section 1 of Social Studies 125, _Introduction to Geographic Information
  Systems_ is over-enrolled by nine.  Section 2 has 22 open slots.
  I'm pretty sure that section 1 meets for the first half of the
  semester and section 2 meets for the section half of the semester.
  Students should be able to switch.
* Section 1 of Statistics 310, _Statistical Modeling_ is over-enrolled
  by 14.  Section 2 has eight slots available.  Since both have the same
  instructor, this is another case in which you see a strong effect of
  class time.  Section 1 is TuTh morning.  Section 2 is TuTh afternoon.
  I expect that labs in science and seminars in other disciplines make
  the afternoon section less popular.

And there you have it.  The most over-enrolled course at Grinnell is
Studio Art 134, _Drawing_, which really needs another section.  Other ones
that I think will be difficult to accommodate include _Linear Algebra_,
_Studies in Shakespeare_, _Women and Gender in Spanish Literature_,
and _Corporate Finance_.  I hope the College finds ways to offer extra
sections of those courses [11].  In most other cases, students will likely
be able to find appropriate alternatives if they are cut.

I'm somewhat comforted to see that there are three English classes that
are over-enrolled and that three of the particularly high-demand courses
are in the humanities.  It suggests that a reasonable number of students
still see value in core humanities topics.  (I'd prefer that they were
not over-enrolled.  But it beats being under-enrolled.)

I haven't been keeping close enough track of enrollments in the
music performance courses.  I hope that students are taking advantage
of the "free" music lessons.  But that's a task for the Office of
Analytic Support and Institutional Research.

I realize that "over-enrolled by *n*" is not necessarily the best way
to talk about these issues.  For example, it is somewhat different
to have a class with a cap of 28 that is over-enrolled by four and
a class of 12 that is over-enrolled by four.  The percentage is
higher in the latter case, but it may be more of a tipping point
for pedagogy in the former case.  Since I can't find a good way to
consider those issues, I haven't listed caps; you can [look them up
yourself](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/).

Which of my advisees should I now worry about or at least consider
making plans with?  The ones who want to take Finance.  But their
Economics advisors can help them with that issue.  The ones who want to
take Drawing.  I already warned them that that course would over-enroll;
I just didn't realize it would be by quite that much.  The one who really
wanted _Linear Algebra_ but could not pre-register.  There's not much I
can do for them [12].  There are probably a few others but it appears that
SelfService and WebAdvisor are down which makes it impossible to check
[14].

I also have a few who want to take courses that limit enrollment for
upper-level students.  How are those classes doing?  Linguistics 114 has
six slots available.  I assume that they will hold those for first-year
students [15].  There are 52 slots available for _Introduction to
Gender, Women's and Sexuality Studies_.  I assume that my students who
want that can get in if they ask nicely.

What about under-enrolled courses?  Many of them are designed for
first-year students, so it's not an issue in those cases.  The
others?  I don't think it's my job to speculate.  There may also
be courses that need to cut students to permit room for first-year
students.  Again, I won't speculate.

And those over-enrolled courses.  What will happen?  Who will be kept?
Who will be cut?  I don't that access to that information.  However, I
may muse again in a week on what "obvious" things happened (e.g., which
courses stayed over-enrolled, what new sections got added, etc.)  Or
I may not.  We'll see what my muse suggests.  

I wish good luck to the students in those over-enrolled classes.
I express sympathy to my colleagues who have to make hard decisions.
I must admit that I'm glad that it's a semester in which I don't have
to make those hard decisions [16]

---

[1] I [mused briefly on the topic](midway-through-prereg-for-2018S) in the
middle of preregistration for spring 2018.  That was close to the time
when I was feeling particularly overwhelmed and took a hiatus from musing.
It appears I never wrote a followup.

[2] Or at least all of the students who manage to get stuff in order
and remember to click the "Register" button.

[3] For example, if a student is interested in taking one of two courses
that are both likely to close and three other courses, they can pick one
of the three other courses that won't over-enroll and leave it off their
schedule.  That allows them to preregister for both of the "one of two"
courses.  They are less likely to get cut from both and, if they do get
cut from both, they are better able to ask for a spot back ("I got cut from
two classes that I was taking to broaden my education; can you find a way
to allow me back into your class?")

[4] I also look at the numbers along the way.  But enrollment patterns
along the way are weird.  For some reason, large numbers of students
wait until the last day to preregister.

[5] My [notes from last year](prereg-2017F) suggest it was worse last
year; that time, she was over-enrolled by ten.

[6] You think by this time I'd know what their normal process is.  But
I forget.  I *think* they'll have larger classes and just add a lab or
two, but I could be wrong.  It depends, in part, on what human resources
are available to the department.

[7] I hear from some Policy Studies faculty that they try not to cut
people from PST-220.

[8] Or at least I don't think it was offered this year.

[9] Also for their Physics major.  And I hear that Linear Algebra is also 
important for some Chemistry majors.

[10] Unknown to me as it's listed as "Staff".  It could be that the Music
department knows who it is and the system just doesn't list them.

[11] It is, of course, not easy to add an extra section of a course.
We don't have spare faculty and we should not ask faculty to teach
[overloads](overloads).  Hence, the normal approach is to find another
course to cut.  But cutting courses is hard.  And it's not as if
faculty are interchangeable.

[12] They have already been in touch with the instructor.

[14] I suppose that I could call our outsourced-in-the-evening help-desk,
but my general experience is that the folks I call have no knowledge of
our systems and no ability to help.  It's not worth my time.

[15] If not, I'm pretty sure that I have six advisees who would claim them
all.

[16] I'm particularly glad because the decision I make is usually one
that's bad for me: "I'll just take extra students."  I'm not even sure
that that decision is best for the students.

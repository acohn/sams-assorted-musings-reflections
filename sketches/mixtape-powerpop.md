A mix "tape": Powerpop
======================

My children have asked that I make them mixtapes of music that I enjoy.
Of course, almost no one uses cassette tapes any more and this is just
a list of songs, so I'm calling this a mix "tape".

This reflects one of my favorite genres of music, power pop.  I think of
power pop as melody plus volume.  But, well, I do tend to vary a bit.  Some
of the things here are by power-pop bands, but take a somewhat different
approach.

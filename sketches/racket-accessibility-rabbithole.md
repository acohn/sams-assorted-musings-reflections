Falling down the Racket accessibility rabbithole
================================================

We teach our introductory course in Scheme/Racket [1].  I'd like to make
sure that our course is accessible.  Recently, someone on the `racket-users`
mailing list posted a question about accessibility in DrRacket, the 
Program Development Environment we use for Racket.

Today I was writing recommendations for some students who
have applied to Grinnell's innovative new [Global Learning
Program](https://www.grinnell.edu/global/institute/gsp), which
provides courses for first-year students that include a significant
travel abroad experience.

Like many Grinnell-designed forms, it doesn't ask much of the faculty
member: Your name, Student's name, Relationship to student, Cooperation
(one of four choices), Work ethic and motiviation (one of four choices),
and Additional Information, which is optional [1].  That's not atypical
for a Grinnell form.  Other than having to tick a few boxes, almost never
are we required to write more than our relationship and, optionally,
some optional additional information.  Given that I typically feel the
need to write one- or two-page [2] recommendation letters for students,
Grinnell trend strikes me as strange.  I expect that it's because of
faculty pushback about writing a lot when we have to fill in a lot of
these forms.


he "choose one of four" entries have four choices: Below Average, Average, Good, and Excellent.  It strikes me as very awkward to have Average be below Good.  In effect, you seem to have combined two different scales: one of Poor, Fair, Good, and Excellent with one of Below Average, Average, and Above Average.  That seems inappropriate.

For next year, I hope that you would choose one set of consistent terms.  If you want to use four choices and the term "Average", I would suggest "Significantly Below Average, Slightly Below Average, Slightly Above Average, and Significantly Above Average".

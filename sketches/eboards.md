Eboards
=======

I'm not sure what students would say were they asked to characterize my
teaching [1].  However, I expect that in addition to commenting on my
generally sarcastic demeanor and large heart, they would also mention
my tendency to use what I call "eboards".  I consider these eboards a
central part of my teaching, and so it seems appropriate to muse on what
this technique is and why I use it.

What: Live typing.

Why? Provides a record the students.  Students really shouldn't need to 
type everything.  For example, they should not need to copy program 
code.  However, I worry about note-taking, since I know something magic
happens when students take pen to paper.  But the best students know
that they should keep notes.

Provides a record for *me*.  When I come back to a class after a few
years (or even a semester), I can see what I talked about the last time
(or the time before that, or the time before that).

Lets me insert random jokes without saying them out loud.  You may have
to experience that approach to understand it.  (My memory is bad enough that
I can't remember particulars; most often, it seems to be misinterpreting
something a student says and then correcting it.)

Supports my "it's okay to fail" philosophy.  Students know to expect
typos.  Students watch me struggle with the computer.

Encourages a few select students to use `vi`.

Implicitly suggests the power of text formatting systems.  I write
in Markdown.  They know that the eboard will eventually appear as a
Web page.  Also the benefit of what is essentially a "low tech" system.

(Lack of) Communications
========================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), Grinnell*

*This is a (somewhat confidential) draft!*

I value my colleagues in Communications, I really do.  Most of the time that
I work with Communications, I find the people I work with thoughtful,
dedicated to their work, and concerned about the institution that is
Grinnell.  I've mused about a few people in Communications I particularly
appreciate; there are certainly many more.  So I generally think positively
about that department.

But then I crash into the problems.  And there are many.  Communications
is responsible for breaking our Web presence and, multiple years later,
still has not ensured that we have a natural way to post public materials
that don't belong on our "advertise to prospective students and parents"
site.  I know of important instances in which Communications (or perhaps
HR) has failed to appropriately value [1] their own staff members.
But what frustrates me most is when Communications fails to understand
the academic program at Grinnell, since that program is the core of
our institution.  Sometimes the issues are minor, such as the failure
to correctly name departments when we first moved to our new stationary.
But sometimes the issues are at surprising odds with what we do.

This musing is inspired by one of the latter issues.
I found a link to a recent posting about a Technology
Studies concentrator entitled "[The Flexibility of a Tech Studies
Concentration](https://www.grinnell.edu/news/flexibility-tech-studies-concentration)".
The piece is a nice profile of a student.  And it says positive
things about the concentration.  So what' s wrong with the piece?
Most importantly, Grinnell is discontinuing the Technology Studies
concentration.  Students have until preregistration [2] in Fall 2019 to
declare a concentration in Technology Studies.  After that, they will
need to declare a concentration its successor, Science, Medicine, and
Society [3,4,5].  So we probably shouldn't be promoting the concentration.

It reminds me of a similar decision to promote the General Science
major from a few months ago.  Why shouldn't Communications promote
the General Science major?  Two important reasons come to mind.  First,
like many Small Liberal Arts Colleges, Grinnell is already struggling 
with an imbalance in majors that leans toward the sciences.  When I
arrived at Grinnell, about one third of students chose majors in
the sciences, one third chose majors in the social studies, and one
third chose majors in the humanities.  Nearly half of majors are now
in the sciences.  I don't think any faculty member is happy about that,
and most would like to see us return to a better balance [7].  So why
is Communications promoting that major to prospective students?

While I'm glad that the students Communications profiled found the General 
Science major useful, my experience has been that most faculty in the
Science division don't see the major as something that most students should
prioritize.  It was originally designed to accommodate students who were 
planning to go on to secondary or primary science teaching.  And that's
its best use.  But it also serves as a fallback plan for students who hit
a roadblock in completing one of the regular science majors.  I see value
in that role; I'm not sure that everyone does.

If you asked Grinnell faculty "Should we promote the General Science
major?", I'm pretty sure that the near-unanimous answer would be "No".
If you asked only science faculty, I'm pretty sure that the distribution
would be the same. If you asked the faculty what programs we should
promote, I expect that neither would appear on the list.

I don't think that the problem is all with Communications.  As a faculty,
we don't necessarily communicate with them enough, either.  I assume they
asked faculty members about Technology Studies and General Science. It
may be that those faculty didn't say "Technology Studies is going away" or
discuss the issues with promoting General Science.  Perhaps running these
kinds of campaigns through Council would help ensure that everyone is on
the same page.

[1] I know I split an infinitive.  I don't care.

[2] Or whatever it's been renamed to.

[3] I had tried to convince folks to use a more Chicago-like name
for the concentration, such as History, Philosophy, and Social Science
of Science, Technology, and Medicine.

[4] I wish I could link to a page for the new concentration.  But, unlike the
concentration, the page does not yet exist.

[5] I believe that we also hope for another successor concentration with a
name like "Digital Studies" or "Digital Liberal Arts" [6].

[6] If I was more energetic, I could probably look up the details in
my email or in old Division Meeting minutes.

[7] I sincerely hope that the HSSC will encourage more students to select
Grinnell because of the strength of its programs in the Humanities and
Social Studies.

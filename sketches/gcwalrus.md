Current status of #gcwalrus: General burial plot located; unsure if the poor thing is still buried in original spot.

#gcwalrus chatter

[cjacobso] Chris J. made the comment "Great, that's all I need - a walrus ghost haunting the library" while researching #gcwalrus...

[cudneyan] The #gcwalrus story has been documented in a few books about the college history: Pioneering: A photographic and Documentary History of Grinnell College... and Grinnell College in the Nineteenth Century being the two sources I used so far. Again, I'd imagine #gcwalrus was promptly dug back up by college admin and disposed of elsewhere, but I haven't found anything saying that yet.

[westerga] There is a drawing of #gcwalrus from one of the participants. I am working with Special Collections right now to dig that photo up and see if we can get it digitized for Digital Grinnell.

[bailey1] The location is approximate given the textual descriptions and maps of the town from that time. Given that the college had buildings named East College and West College, it'd only make sense that the center of the campus have Central College. Again, I would need to either go to Drake or the courthouse to dig up plot maps from the 1870s to get the exact location, but both Special Collections and I have a sense where the building was located at the time.

Also, glad to find you on [plans], fellow Twitter librarian :cD

[foleya] It is! Also fun, and possibly a good candidate for a MAP if there's a student that wants to dig deeper into this story... or possibly create a tradition with doing a reenactment at the end of Hell Week in the spring semester.

[haggar] Noted! I suspect, though, that the poor thing was evicted from its grave soon after the burial for proper disposal, so it might not be there anymore.

[krugerel] All sources point to a real walrus that was stuffed. There were multiple people involved with the burial, so they at least had the numbers to move #gcwalrus. Again, we don't have documentation stating if it was left in the burial plot or promptly removed for proper disposal, so it's most likely that #gcwalrus met its final *final* fate with college officials removing it from the impromptu resting place.


#gcwalrus updates (dates in ascending order)

Today I learned that in the 1800s a group of Grinnell students gave a badly burnt stuffed walrus a burial that got them into trouble with a faculty member.

I do not know if the walrus is still buried, and, if so, if the location is known.

Perhaps that should be changed. We need to know what came of that poor walrus, if it is still buried on campus, and give it a proper headstone to go with the proper burial it received over a hundred years ago.

(Chatter archive) stone - This came up as I was watching Grinnell Stories, a (20-something year old video) collection of interviews and stories about history of the college. I will need to go to the archives and see if Chris has any further information about #gcwalrus. If I remember correctly, the student leader of the burial plot was a son of a trustee, which meant the professor couldn't expel him from the college. The video made no mention about where the burial was or if they marked the grave, though.

#gcwalrus update - From Wall's Grinnell College in the Nineteenth Century, 168-171:

"The incident involved the stuff carcass of a walrus which the college had been given to be exhibited in Henry Parker's museum. When the building in which the museum was housed was destroyed by fire in 1871, only a portion of the museum's exhibits were saved, but unfortunately the walrus was one of those objects rescued and was placed in the entryway of the college's remaining building. Parker's successor as professor of chemistry and curator of the museum, Henry Carmichael, attempted to restore preservative on the fire-damaged beast in whatever free time he had, but these were rare movements and the work progressed slowly. As the months passed, the carcass began to ripen, and in the warm spring weather, the odor became ever more pungent and reached the top floor where Adams and a few other boys lived.

"Appeals to Professor Carmichael for relief were unavailing, so Henry and his comrades decided to take direct action. On a warm May night, just before the ten o'clock curfew when all students were required to be in bed, these self-appointed undertakers stole out of their rooms, hastily dug a shallow grave and interred the decaying beast. Not content with this simple and necessary burial, Henry suggested that the poor corpse be given a decent farewell. What had originated as a mere act of sanitation quickly became a jolly lark. They placed a crude wooden monument at the head of the grave:

Hic Jacet
Walrus Boanerges
Oft called the iceberg's daughter
A
Member of
Prof. Comical's department
Died Aug. 7 1870

"At the foot of the mound, they placed a card: 'This walrus standing where it did was a public nuisance, offensive to both sight and smell. After bearing it for some time it was thought best to give him a decent burial.'

"The next morning the call went out that the perpetrators of this act should come forward and confess. This all of those involved willingly did. They were charged with four violations of college rules for which apology was required: first, they had broken the ten o'clock rule; second, they had violated the respect due to instructors (it was that reference to 'Prof. Comical's department' that was particularly resented); third, they had no business to meddle with college property; and fourth, they had disturbed the public peace. The boys accepted this bill of indictment and apologized to Magoun."

The next few paragraphs go on to talk about the students' voluntary self-suspension in protest of the president suspending one student from the group.

So, we have a shallow grave. I fear that #gcwalrus might have been dug up afterwards or disturbed in its grave during one of the many building projects on campus. Special Collections is looking more into this, including if there is a location where the burial might have taken place.

Progress on #gcwalrus thanks to Special Collections - From Jones' Pioneering: A photographic and Documentary History of Grinnell College..., p. 29, an excerpt of the letter Henry Carter Adams wrote to his father:

"I do not wish to state this as an excuse for my conduct that it was a public nuisance, although it was such and was the remark of all who saw it. This walrus we buried by the path in front of the new building cellar, picking out this place so that it would not deface college property in the least... We fixed the grave so it would look respectable, mounding it over on top, and placed a monument at his head... Besides this we took the cannon and fired a salute over his grave. This was our 'crime'..."

We now have a slightly better idea what happened at the burial (I'm assuming that the cannon was a hand one? If not, I would say that it would be a sight to see a group of college students fire a larger one); more importantly, we have a location. The fire took place in 1871 and from Wall's account below the burial took place in May 1872. The burial took place "by the path in front of the new building cellar" which means we need to find out which building(s) was considered new around that time. There is a timeline that I can consult in terms of building dates and construction. When I have a chance to check out this timeline, I'll report back what I find in terms of a possible burial location.

We have a general location of the #gcwalrus burial plot! The "new building" referred to in the last entry was Central College, which started construction in 1871 and finished in 1872. However, both Special Collections and I have not been able to locate a map of the campus pre-tornado, making the exact location unknown to us for now. We can guesstimate the burial location, though: somewhere near the north end of Burling and around the Peace Grove. If we were really motivated, we could go to Drake Library or the courthouse to see if they have any plot maps from the 1870s, but I'll leave it at that for now.

This doesn't mean that #gcwalrus is still buried on campus. The most likely outcome of this burial would be digging #gcwalrus back up from its resting place and then disposing it somewhere else. If that didn't happen, then it might have been disturbed in the 100+ years of campus growth and building. This part could be solved if there is any documentation as to the fate of #gcwalrus post-burial, and I'll have to keep an eye out for any clues.

For now, though, when you walk past the front end of Burling and the Peace Grove, take a moment of silence for #gcwalrus.

(Chatter archive) stone aerni - glad you both enjoyed the wild #gcwalrus chase the last couple of days. The story is not over - for instance I'd like to find out if the walrus is still buried in the original burial plot - but we're at a good stopping point for now. :c)

A few forthcoming essays (a not-quite preview)
==============================================

I'm not sure why, but my muse seems to be having trouble helping me
figure out what to write today.  I've thought about a few topics, and
started writing some of them, but ended up discarding each.  I'm not sure
whether it's lack of sleep, an after effect of being out of town, a
natural stage as I'm nearing three hundred essays and running out of 
obvious topics, a side effect of spring break, something else, or
a combination of things.  In any case, no particular topic is really
motivating me today.  So, I'm going back to an approach that I tried

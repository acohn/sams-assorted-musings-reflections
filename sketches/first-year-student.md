Naming class years
==================

A parent on the Grinnell Parents Facebook page asked about the terms
we use for students.  It went something like this.

> I like the terms 1st year, 2nd year, etc. instead of freshman,
sophomore, etc..  Does anyone know how those got started?

I don't know when they got started, but I know why we use them.

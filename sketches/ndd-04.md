Nibbled to death by ducks, Episode four: The ducks strike back
==============================================================

In [our second episode](ndd-02) I had managed to finish most of the
small and medium tasks I'd thought about for the day.  In [our last 
episode](ndd-03), I had been unable to complete most of the tasks.  Will
I be able to catch up?  We will see.

I will note that I am reminded that the tasks impinge upon my life in
multiple ways.  There's the time that it takes to do them [1].  But they
also eat at my brain a bit.  I know that task lists are supposed to
make it better, but I find that many tasks continue to impinge upon
my thoughts until they get done.  It may be fun to have them impinge.
For example, I may have to prepare a lecture on a new topic and I mentally
gather ideas for the lecture throughout the day.  On a different note,
sometimes it's interesting to think about the steps involved in a task
[2].  But they still get in the way.  Oh well, on to the tasks.
Here's what I was left with at the end of yestserday.  Note that this
list is primarily the smaller things that should take under an hour each
and does not include many medium and large tasks, such as the syllabi for
my courses and the various proposals and papers that I am supposed to write.

Yay!  So many fun things to work on.  Let's get going!    I suppose that
the first thing I should do is classify and prioritize a bit.

**Email messages to send**.  Email should be quick, right?  These are messages
that I need to send, most of which are short.

**Delay**.  These are non-critical things that can (and probably should)
wait until next week, or at least the weekend.

**Workshop preparation**.  Our department workshop is next week.  I need
to be ready.  As importantly, I need to have things available for my
colleagues to review in advance.  Many of these will be done
synchronously.  

> 
_Workshop syllabus._
_Exit interviews._

**Other high-priority tasks**.  These are equivalently important things,
some of which are important enough to do before the Workshop prep, some of 
which can be done afterwards.

> _Rebuild CSR._
_Certificates for code camp._

**Should be quick**.  Things that are small enough that I just want to
get them off of the lists.

Email to send
-------------

_Check with colleagues on form for peer educator data._  I am frustrated
by the data we received when we asked for student hours so that we could
do some analysis.  In particular, someone thought it made sense to just
give us a summary of the total number of hours students had worked
throughout the year, even though students worked different jobs each
semester and sometimes multiple jobs in each semester.  I would prefer
as close to "raw data" as I can get.  But I wanted to make sure that
my colleagues agreed.  I planned to send email, but ended up asking in
person.

_Check with students on DSSG paper._ It's time to check in with my
students to see if they want to attend the upcoming conference on Data
Science for Social Good and, if so, whether they'd like me to work on
a paper.  If so, I'll draft it tonight.

_Schedule MAP interviews._  I need to let my students know that we need
to do MAP interviews before they leave.  That should be a quick email.
I may also try to grab students throughout the day.

_Pictures for letter - ask summer students and others._  I'm doing
CS/Math/Stats placements this weekend.  We have a small amount of space
on the second side of the letter and typically use it for interesting
projects from CS, Mathematics, and Statistics classes.  I should check
with this summer's projects to see if they have images they want to
submit.

_Registrar re 151._  One of my colleagues made an agreement with the
high school last year that if the high school offered AP CS Principles,
they would make sure that there were things for students to continue
doing after CSP.  Three freshmen [6] took it.  The agreement suggests
that they should be able to take CSC 151 this fall.  But Grinnell College
thinks that Grinnell College students should have priority.  In the past,
I've reached an agreement with the Registrar to over-enroll slightly in
order to allow high-school students to take the course, and I need to
re-verify that.

Quick tasks
-----------

_Staples._  As part of the broader rearrangement of Noyce 3rd, we have
set up a new printer space.  It looks like the staples disappeared along
the way, so I moved a few of my boxes of staples to that new space.

Other high priority tasks
-------------------------

_Certificates for code camp._  One of the great innovations of this
summer's Code Camp Counselors is to award graduation certificates to
all of the students.  I've promised to make them for this camp [n].
That means finding the old text ('eh; it needs rewriting); finding some
nice certificate stock, rather than the normal paper they used last
time [n]; writing new text; setting up the mail merge; and printing
the certificates.

[n] The campers also receive nicely-drawn appreciation notes.  I do not
have to deal with these notes, except to add a short note of my own.

[n] Amazingly, the certificate stock I purchased in the OfficeMax
closing is nicely filed.

Things that came up during the day
----------------------------------

_Advise ECF faculty member on password rant._  "Sam, who should I write
to about Grinnell's failure to follow modern password guidelines?"  
":DaveR and Rob Buchwald.  But they already know it's an issue.  Change
takes time."

_Respond to questions on photographs from newspaper._  What questions?
I should probably just quote them directly.

> Hi, Sam – thanks for working with us on the coding camp coverage! We
will use the photos you singled out, but I wanted some additional photos
of people working together. Could you please help ID and give a little
info on what might be happening in the following other three photos.
[...]  Oh and we are on deadline for today’s paper – welcome to
our world!

So I dug out the links to the photos, looked at the photos, attempted to
identify the campers, some of whom were at the previous camp, attempted
to identify the activity, and got counselor feedback to make sure that I
was correct.

_Interview students_.

---

[1] And, when I'm using like this, to write about them.

[2] Michelle suggested a new organization for our too many games.  I like
the idea, since it will make it easier to find them than looking in the
ten or so places in which games seem to find themselves [3].  Of course,
it may just be a trick so that she can more easily tell how many games
we have, but I guess I can live with that.  In any case, Here's what
I've been saying to myself.

> If we're putting the games where the SF currently lives, the
SF will have to move somewhere.  One possibility is the shelves in the
second-floor hallway.  I can also box up some of it, as long as I know
where the boxes are.  Now, what about the games.  Will they fit?  Well,
I can gather them up from everywhere [5] or at least count how many I
have.  I can estimate how many will fit by extrapolating from the current
number.  Oh, yeah, I'll need to get some boxes to store the SF books
for now.  Where will the books from the second-floor hallway go?  And
will the SF fit there in any case?

[3] Is it ten?  Let's see ... 1. Basement. 2. Out in the dining room for
game night [4].  3. In the lower-right set of cabinets in the dining
room.  4. In the lower-left set of cabinets in the dining room.  5. Coffee
table in my home office.  6. Top of bookshelves in my home office.  7.
North bookshelves in family room.  8. South bookshelves in family room.
9. Game bookshelf in family room.  10. Behind the couch in the family
room.  11. Games shelf in family room.  12. Middle set of cabinets in
the dining room.  13. Bottom set of shelves in the dining room.

[4] Those are the ones that folks play regularly or that I am thinking of
suggesting for the week.

[5] See end note 3 for information on what "everywhere" might mean.

[6] Although Grinnell College uses the term "first year" and I use
the term "freshling", GHS uses "freshman".

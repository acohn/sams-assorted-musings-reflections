Taskcading, revisited
=====================

As I noted in [a recent musing](taskcading-2017-06-26), I often find that
when I sit down to complete a task, I'm discover that each task leads
to another task, which leads to another task, which leads to another task.
That is, my tasks are taskcading.  Upon reflection, it may also be that
I also have a wide variety of things "on the back burner" and that I'm
easily distractable.  Here's another example.

Drafting a schedule of topics for the new CSC 151.

I decided it would be easiest to do so in the context of the course
Web site.

That meant I needed to think about how to structure that site given
my past experiences with Jekyll.

Lots of copying and moving around.

Oh, yeah, I should fix some of the problems.  

* If Javascript is off, the menus don't work.  I could use a hack, or
  I could choose an elegant solution.  I did the latter.
* No index for the writeups.

It irritates me to see incorrect information.  That means that I should
update the meeting time, list of mentors, and such.  

Oh, I guess I have to figure out my office hours for fall.  That means
putting together my fall schedule.  When are those classes, anyway?
Hmmm ... I promised myself that I'd put grading and catching up on
email on the schedule.  I wonder if I should include evenings in my
schedule?  Bleh.

Oh, yeah, the old site should have a different color.  Where is that
grey stylesheet?

Damn!  We don't have Tuesday classes any more.  Should homework still
be due on Tuesday nights?  (Probably.)  How does that work with the
scripts we wrote for building the syllabus (Better than I expected.)

[Detour: Link cleaning.]

Hiring term faculty
===================

This year, we're looking to hire a few multi-year term faculty
members to help accommodate leaves and support our program.  I've
described some benefits and challenges of term faculty in a [companion
musing](term-faculty).  That's not what this musing is about.  It's about
hiring the term faculty in the first place.

Most of the faculty and administrators I talk to treat the hiring of
term faculty as a straightforward or easy thing.  And that's likely
their experience.  In almost every academic discipline outside of
computer science, the number of interested candidates nationwide [1]
far outstrips the number of available positions.

But that's not my experience.  We generally find it hard to hire a
term faculty member in CS.  And I feel like I have to explain that to
administrators and to colleagues in other departments that again and
again and again.  So, this musing is intended to serve as my point of
reference when I want to explain our concerns.

What is our experience?  In the most recent round of term hires, we were
only able to fill only one of two open multi-year positions [2].  We've
seen little evidence that it will be any easier the next time.

Why do we get so few quality applications?  Because there are so few 
computer scientists who want a career that looks like ours.  Industry is
tempting.  Our top new graduates [3] have six-figure starting salaries and
other perks.  I don't think we pay either our new tenure-line faculty or
our term faculty that much.  I don't think other institutions do, either.

But even within academia, there are a host of other opportunities.
Large numbers look to positions at R1 institutions, either tenure-line
or research track.  For people interested in a more teaching-oriented
career, the growth in student enrollments have led to a number of
"teaching track" positions at R1 universities, many with tenure-like
security of employment.  

So, how many new Ph.D.'s choose positions at places like Grinnell?
It's hard to tell for sure.  What I can tell is that of the 1500 or so
folks who got Ph.D.'s in CS/CE in 2016 and have known destinations [4],
only 27 went to non-Ph.D-granting institutions.  If we optimistically
assume a similar rate for the folks with unknown destinations [5]
and the folks coming off of postdocs [8], we come up with about 40
Ph.D.'s per year [9] who are going to non-Ph.D.-granting institutions.
That includes not just selective liberal arts colleges like Grinnell
[10], but masters granting institutions, community colleges, and more.
With so many options, many of which are tenure line, and so few people,
what chance do we have to hire multiple term faculty with Ph.D.'s in
computer science?

[1] Or worldwide.

[2] We were fortunate to hire an excellent person for that one position.
He is a valued colleague who students love, who has helped develop new 
curricula, and who spent his summer supervising student research.  

[3] with Bachelor of Arts degrees in CS from Grinnell.

[4] I believe about 400 have unknown destinations.

[5] Since it's easy to track folks at academic institutions, I would guess
that those with unknown destinations are outside of academia and perhaps
outside of the country [6].

[6] 60% of new Ph.D.'s in CS are held be people from countries outside of
North America [7]

[8] I expect that folks who get a postdoc are generally looking for a
more research-oriented position.  Most of the candidates we see come
straight from graduate school.

[9] Here's m math.  If we ignore the 200 or so who took postdocs, 27/1286
of new Ph.D.'s, or about 2%, took jobs at non-Ph.D. departments.  2% of
the 200 or so postdocs and under 400 unknown destinations gives us another
11 or 12.  We'll round up to 40.

[10] And Pomona, Carleton, St. Olaf, Wellesley, Washington and Lee,
Amherst, and Macalester, all of whom are hiring for tenure-line
positions this year [11].

[11] I think Amherst, Carleton, and Macalester are all trying to hire
two.

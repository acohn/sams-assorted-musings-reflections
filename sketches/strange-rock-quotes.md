Strange rock quotes
===================

_Disclaimer: This musing represents one of my first attempts to muse
about something I love and know, but is not part of my core expertise:
rock music.  Unlike the [mixtape musings](index-mixtapes), this one
focuses not so much on my reaction to the music as the music itself._

_Disclaimer: I expect that few of my readers have heard of either of these
bands, let alone both.  And it's not just that these are "eighties bands".
If I'd written this piece in the eighties, the same would have been true.
They both should have been bigger.

I was recently listening to a live recording of the Del-Lords [1].
Toward the end of the set, they went into a cover of Springsteen's
"Johnny 99" that, better than even Springsteen's original, covers the
Guthrie-esque populist pain in the song [3].  I hadn't recalled hearing
"Johnny 99" on any of their albums, so I went to the Web to see if I'd
missed anything.

One of the first things I found was a review of a 1986 Del-Lords show
in the Washington post by Geoffrey Himes, a writer I usually enjoy [4].
Himes writes

> Like a New York version of the Blasters, the Del-Lords chewed up rock's
roots in rockabilly and rhythm and blues and produced populist originals
with an immediate urgency.

It's not fair to Himes, but I found myself gnawing on that "New York
version of the Blasters" comment.  The Blasters are one of my favorite
bands: Dave's words and Phil's voice are an unbeatable combination.
And I love the sound and harmony and power of the Del-Lords.  But
is it fair to compare them like that, even with the contextualization?

Both groups have clear populist roots, they care about the Common Man [5]
and it appears in their songs.  

Both grew from punk scenes rooted in large, multicultural cities [n].
Both were part of the their scene and, unlike many of their cohort,
embraced, rather than rejected, the past [n].  The Blasters would never be
mistaken for the Germs nor Agent Orange nor even their closest kin in X.
The Del-Lords would never be mistaken for the speed of the Ramones
nor the angular sounds of Televison nor the poetry of Patti Smith.
But Kempner played a large role in the Dictators.

[n] The Blasters from LA, the Del-Lords from NYC.

[n] That's an unfair simplification that does not do justice to many
of those bands.  Certainly Patti Smith sang Van Morrison and Bruce
Springsteen [n] 

[n] Yeah, I know, Springsteen was also a contemporary.  But he was
clearly not of the scene.

Neither would be mistaken for pop; they are on the Stones side of the
imaginary Stones/Beatles divide.

But the similarities seem to end there.  The Blaster's music draws
from a variety of genres, many of which they detail in "American
Music".

> We got the Louisiana boogie and the delta blues.  We got country, swing
and rockabilly, too.  We got jazz, country-western and Chicago blues.
It's the greatest music that you ever knew.  It's American music [n].

The Del-Lords seem to cover many of the things that are missing from that
quote: Doo Wop, the Brill Building sound, the occasional Spectorian
excess, the swagger of the leather-clad garage bands, and more.
Even without the vocals, you would rarely mistake a Blasters song for
the Del-Lords, or a Del-Lords song for the Blasters; the Blasters are
on the Americana side of rock, the Del-Lords are closer to the
hard-rock side.  There are certainly exceptions: "A Lover's Prayer", 
"Mercenary"
could be by the Blasters (although, if it were, it would probably have 
horns).

too much
would not mistake a Blasters song for 

Both: The personal.

Del Lords: First person.  "I hope wherever you are is a better place
than this 'cause I'm left here alone."  Blasters: Outside observer.  
"One more midnight, her man is still gone.  The nights move too slow."
Not quite fair: Some early Blasters songs are written in the first person.

Then there's the voice.  The Blasters focus on Phil's amazing instrument.
I've never found the right way to describe it.  I thought Greil Marcus
had written about it, but I can't find it in _Stranded_ or on his
Web site.  There's just a hint of twang, but not as extreme as you
normally hear in country or rockabilly.  And, it's clearly also an issue
of phrasing; I just can't quite put it into words.  Here's what his
rother, Dave, says.

> My brother has a really rare voice— especially in this day and
age. He harkens back to the way blues shouters like Big Joe Turner and
Wynonie Harris used to sing. [...] My brother has this big, loud voice
that’s kind of cocky and self-assured, but also very emotional and
evocative. It’s a voice you don’t hear everyday, and that’s a
rare gift [n].

In contrast, the Del-Lords are all about harmonies.  A now-deleted
article in _Variety_ [n] suggests that

> Modeled on British bands of the ‘60s that used several singers –
Kinks, Beatles, the Who - Kempner’s vision was to create an act that
would feature four singers performing his songs, an East Coast Beach Boys,
if you will [n].

[n] Okay, maybe it's just a journalistic trope to compare the Del-Lords to
assorted California bands.  Perhaps I'll find something that says they
were an East-coast Germs or East-coast Eagles [n].

[n] 


One way I think about bands being closely associated is to imagine one doing
the songs of the other.  I can't imagine the Blasters doing Judas Kiss or
Cheyenne [n] or ....  I can't imagine the Del-Lords doing Border Radio [n]

[n] The Blasters don't have to fantasize about the desert or the country;
they're clearly close to it.

[n] It moves too slow.

On the other hand, I can envision both groups singing "Johnny 99".  I'd
love to hear a Del-Lords cover of "Common Man".  (Can I see the Blasters
cover any Del-Lords songs?  I'll have to think about it.)

But no, the Del-Lords are *not* an NYC version of the Blasters.  Both
bands are great.  Both bands are populist, whatever that may mean.  But 
they are so clearly different that the comparison seems ill thought out,
at best.  And I certainly wouldn't call either of them "pop" [n]

[n] I realize that journalists rarely choose their own headlines.

Up soon: A Blasters/Del-Lords mixtape.

great songs.  It's almost certainly required listening right now.

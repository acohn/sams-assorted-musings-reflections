The Union
=========

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), short*

_Sam, what are your opinions about the decision of Grinnell undergraduate student workers to unionize?_

Since I supervise or have supervised students, including research assistants,
peer educators, department assistants, and even the GSP student assistants,
it does not seem appropriate for me to comment in public.

_Do you have any thoughts that you consider it acceptable to share?_

Sure.

I'm surprised that there has not been coverage of the issue in either
_Chronicle of Higher Education_ or _Inside Higher Ed_.  It strikes me
that an issue of this apparent import should get wider coverage.

I feel sorry for Mike Latham, who has stepped in as Interim President
in the midst of this matter and is therefore getting the brunt of some
protests.  I don't think President Kington intended for all this to happen
on his sabbatical, but I expect it's hard on Mike and it's certainly more
than he signed up for.

I admit to some confusion.  I had thought that unions of undergraduate
student workers were rare.  I see that [UGSDW](https://www.ugsdw.org/about/)
is "[t]he first independent undergraduate labor union in the country".
Are there many others, either independent or whatever the alternative
is? [1]

The union has done a much better job than the College of presenting its
side, leading to things like very pro-union articles in _The Des Moines
Register_ and alumni who have no idea why the College would object to
a union.  Maybe if the College paid the union what it pays our marketing
consultants, they could distribute that money to other students and
everyone would be happy [2].

That's about it.  Whatever happens, I'll adapt.  And I'll continue to
advocate for higher pay for student workers, for MAP/MIP students, and
the rest.

[1] I know that there are a reasonable number of graduate student unions.
My questions is about undergraduates.

the union Web site.

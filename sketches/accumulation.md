Accumulating stuff
==================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), rambly*

People who know me know that I accumulate stuff.  A lot of stuff.

The OfficeMax purchase.  It has been so damn useful to have these supplies
around.  Plastic zipper bags.  Stickers.  Business cards.    Some stuff
went to other people.  Kid paints and notebooks to Tilly.  Coin wrappers
to Lee for her multiples course.  Crayons to a supply drive.  Pencils to
the high school.

Psychological issues - a bit of an addiction.  

Underlying thought processes: Don't like to see things go to waste.  Enjoy
finding things cheap.

Might find things that make me happy.  Why do things make me happy?  That's
also an issue for my psychologist.

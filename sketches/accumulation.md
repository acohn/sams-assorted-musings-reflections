Accumulating stuff
==================

The OfficeMax purchase.  It has been so damn useful to have these supplies
around.  Plastic zipper bags.  Stickers.  Business cards.  

Psychologocial issues - a bit of an addiction.  

Underlying thought processes: Don't like to see things go to waste.  Enjoy
finding things cheap.

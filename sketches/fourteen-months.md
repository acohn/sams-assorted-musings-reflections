Fourteen months of daily musings
================================

*Forthcoming*

I have reached fourteen non-consecutive months of daily musings [1].

Observation: One of the negative side effects of these musings is that
I am now tempted to put snarky endnotes in the other things I write:
professional papers [2], readings for class [3], and such.  Fortunately,
I don't seem as tempted to do so in memos and email messages.

[1] A placeholder for this musing appeared on 31 August 2017 so that
I could link to it from [the prior end-of-month musing](thirteen-months).

[2] I may have even included one or two snarky footnotes in [some recent
papers](recovering-from-1-sept-2017).

[3] A student did remind me that I've always been a bit sarcastic in
the readings I write.  For example, a reading on text includes a
commentary, intended as positive, on Mark Schneider's old proposal
for a Tuition-free Grinnell.

Thinking about term faculty
===========================

Over the next few years, we hope to hire a few term faculty in computer
science [1,3].  I've been thinking a lot about term faculty lately,
particularly as we discuss what roles they will play in the department.

There are many things that term faculty can do that benefit the department.

Most obviously, term faculty can teach classes.  However, most of the
term [4] faculty we hire are new to teaching and need some time to get
up to speed.  Since term faculty are for, well, a short term, we don't
have a long opportunity to benefit from the teaching expertise they
develop in their first year at Grinnell.

Some term faculty can and want to supervise research students.
Student-faculty research has been a core part of the Grinnell CS education
for more than a decade.  A year or two ago, the faculty voted to ensure
that all interested students have the opportunity to do research.
The more folks who can support this endeavor, the better [5].

Some term faculty can and want to contribute to department discussions
of curriculum and other issues.

Term faculty can advise students informally about post-graduate plans,
internships, and other similar issues.

Term faculty also bring new ideas and perspectives to the department.
It can be exciting for students to encounter new areas and new ideas.
It can be equally exciting for the faculty to encounter these new ideas
and approaches.

But there are also many things that term faculty can't do, or shouldn't
do, or won't do.

Term faculty cannot and should not serve as advisors.  Given that Grinnell
has an individually advised curriculum, advising at Grinnell is hard.
Advising also requires a broad understanding of the structures, policies,
requirements, and expectations at Grinnell.  It takes some time to develop
that knoweldge.  By the time term faculty develop that knowledge, they
are gone.  

Few term faculty will want to participate in long-term departmental
planning.  It's hard to make plans for the long term when you know that
you are only there for the short term.

Few term faculty serve on faculty committees.

So, does it make sense to hire term faculty?  I think it depends on the
context.  If you're replacing a faculty member on leave, it does not make
sense to replace that faculty member with a tenure-line faculty member [6].
But if you're trying to build a program, then you need people who are
commited to the program for the long haul and who can advise students.

Just a thought [8].

[1] "Term faculty" are faculty hired to work here for a limited amount
of time.  We sometimes refer to them as "visiting faculty".  They teach
a full load and get benefits, which distinguishes them from adjuncts.  As
far as I know, Grinnell makes very little use of adjuncts [2].

[2] I"m glad that we make little use of adjuncts, since adjunct contracts
are generally exploitative.  But I don't know if Grinnell makes limited
use of adjuncts for principled reasons or because we're far from anywhere
from which to draw large numbers adjuncts.  Unfortunately, I suspect that
it's the latter reason, rather than the former.

[3] We also hope to hire tenure-line faculty, but I'm still pushing
on that.

[4] And tenure-line.

[5] We don't require our term faculty to supervise research.  But some
do, and the College does seem to compensate them at the same rate as
regular faculty.

[6] Some would argue that you should staff a department sufficiently that
replacements are not necessary when someone is on leave.  My experience is
that such an approach usually takes too much planning and agreement [7] and
can only work for departments like CS, Mathematics/Statistics, and Physics,
in which we think that every faculty member should be able to teach most of
the undergraduate curriculum.

[7] E.g., when two people have leave in the same year, one must delay.

[8] Or maybe a few thoughts.

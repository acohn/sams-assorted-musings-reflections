Words to live by
================

In some recent exercise, we were asked to come up with a slogan or set
of words we live by or something like that.  My first attempt was a
phrase that I say fairly often.

> The ultimate outcome of a liberal arts education is to be able to
bullshit thoughtfully, clearly, and compellingly about nearly any topic.

But that's more a general thought on my profession than on myself, so I
tried again.

> Change the world.  Be a curmudgeon.  

While that's something I believe.  I don't like how that one flows.  It
also misses some of the more positive aspects of my personality [1].a
Here's my next attempt.

> Embrace your inner curmudgeon.

I kind of like that one.  "Embrace" is a positive word.  And I am 
definitely a curmudgeon.

As I was walking in today, I thought about quotations that come to mind.
Unfortunately, the one that most resonates seems to be from Robert Burns'
"To a Mouse" [2]

> But Mousie, thou art no thy-lane,

> In proving foresight may be vain:

> The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men

> Gang aft agley,

> An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain,

> For promis’d joy!

That's a little gloomy, isn't it?  Nonetheless, it seems correct for the
current stte of the U.S>

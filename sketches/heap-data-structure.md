The heap data structure
=======================

A little bit ago [1], I wrote [a short essay in which I listed potential
forthcoming topics](forthcoming-146).  I ended up writing about some
of them, but not all of them.  One of the topics I never got around to
was heap sort.  I think it's time to get around to it.  But as I think
about heap sort, it probably requires two essays, one on heaps and one
on the sorting algorithm that is based on heaps.

Why write about heaps and heap sort?  There are two main reasons.
One is that the heap is a really cool data structure [2] and heap
sort is an equally cool algorithm that requires the data structure.

[1] Well, about one hundred essays ago.

[2] Yes, it's a data structure, not an ADT [3].

[3] An ADT is an abstract data type.  I generally tell students that
they should think about ADTs as the *what* of a way of a collection
of data and the data structure as the *how* [4].

[4] Okay, I'm not sure that I tell them exactly that, but it's close neough.

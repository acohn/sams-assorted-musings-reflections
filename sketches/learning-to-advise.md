Learning to advise
==================

*Part of an occasional series about advising at Grinnell.*

Introduction

As [I've suggested](week-of-advising-oct-2017), there are a lot of 
different aspects to advising at Grinnell. ...

But we'll start with the most obvious one: Helping students craft their
liberal arts education.  Should start with some understanding [n].  Strengthened
by reading.  We read the College's statement on a liberal arts education
[n].  We read things our colleagues suggest, such as William Cronon's
_Only Connect_.  When I was a young faculty member, we read Martha
Nussbaum's _Cultivating Humanity_.

[n] I would hope that most faculty start with a stronger understanding
than some of our students, to whom liberal education means little more
than "small class sizes and faculty who know my name" [n]

That's not to say that those are not important issues.  They may be 
necessary to a strong liberal arts education, but they are a tool,
not the education itself.

[n] Did Paula write that?  I think so.

Can also be strengthened by writing [n].

[n] One of the essays when I applied to Grinnell was about why CS belongs
in a liberal arts education.  My model then, and partially still, was that
one of the most important aspects of a liberal arts education is that it
lets you think in multiple ways [n].

[n] My model has grown since then.

Learn through experience.  A student

Learn that you shouldn't do it alone.  You can send students to other
resources.  You can use resources yourself; call a colleague (faculty
or staff).  Talk in STaLG or elsewhere.

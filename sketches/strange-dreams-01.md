A Strange Dream, 2016-10-18
===========================

An attempt to gather up a really great strange dream.

1. I buy a book, called something like "_____ the true story of ______'s
_______."  (That is, the true story of some other author's famous book.)

2. Various episodes of me reading the book and the content of the book.
Somewhat fantastic (as in fantasy).  (The details are hard to remember.
I think the main characters (human) keep coming back to the same place
and have one of these fantasy types helping them.  But they fail and
fail agin.  In a fit of frustration, they shoot down a cloth drape of
some sort and discover a party of the real rulers of the fanasy land.
They sneak in, beg for help from the ruler, get invited to stay, and
eventually defeat the bad stuff.  (I can't remember what the bad stuff
was.)  There's of the characters staying overnight and making some joke
about deciding to wear elfin makeup.

3. I'm looking up the original book and this book.  I discover (I think)
that there was no original book, and this book is a prank / hoax /
interesting thing.

4. I'm at a booksale.  Someone (Cecilia Knight?) grabs it from me and
says "We weren't supposed to send this to the sale."  I inisist that
I bought it earlier, and just brought it with me.  She says it doesn't
matter, it belongs to her family and her sister really really wants it.

5. We eventually decide that the sister should have it.  (I extract
promises to get the book if they ever decide to give it up.)  (I also
realize that I have an electronic version.)

6. I talk to the sister (Tammy Nyden?) and she talks about reading it
as a yong adult.  I say something like "Yeah, I can see how this would
be really important to a kid."

7. I'm at the writer's house, talking about the book.

Organization (and lack thereof)
===============================

I like to be organized.  People who have seen my office, lab, car, computer
desktop, and, well, any aspect of my life may have trouble believing that.
But it's true.

Look at end note two of the [fourth episode of "Nibbled to death by ducks"](...).  I like thinking about how to organize.

So why I am not not organized?  I have too much stuff.  I like
accumluating stuff.  I have trouble getting rid of stuff.  And, as most
of my readers know, I have too little time.

Annotating the Web
==================

*Disclaimer: I'm using this musing to reflect on a number of issues.
It may be even less linear and structured than normal.*

Recently, my colleagues in Grinnell's [Center for Teaching, Learning,
and Assessment](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/centers/ctla) have
started using [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) to collaboratively
annotate Web pages.  For example, you can see [some notes on my musing
on measurable course outcomes](https://via.hypothes.is/http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/measurable-course-outcomes).  Their use of web
annotation software got me thinking about my early career at Grinnell.

Arrived at Grinnell with two projects that I collectively referred to
as "violating Web norms".  My students and I worked on projects that
involved gathering data about usage (violating norms of privacy) and
that allowed readers to manipulate the pages they viewed (violating
norms of ownership).

I'll write about why we were tracking users in a subsequent musing.  
This musing is more about what we were doing related to manipulating
pages.  

The Web was young.  Conflict between those just encountering the
technology for the first time and those thinking about it in terms of
a broader context, particularly Vannevar Bush's 1945 article "[As We May
Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)".
Bush's model of hypertext was much richer than that of the early Web.
Among other things, he envisioned people who would put together articles
by finding a sequence of useful pages in different sources, annotating
those pages, inserting a few pages of their own, and linking it all
together.  The Web provided essentially none of the features necessary
for that model.

And so in my arrogance, I had students work on building tools for annotation
and trail blazing.  Good student projects, lots of interesting issues
(pages that change, extracting part of a paage).  Students did a lot and
learned a lot.  Huge detour from my graduate research on functional
programming.

Intellectual property: "Someone just patented a project very similar to mine."
"Grinnell claims no ownership of your patentable material and so provides
you with no resources in situations like this."  (Complications: They should
have, given Bayh Dole act of 1980.)

And the Web got much more complex.  It's much different to deal with a
static page with no separate layout information than a page with CSS 
or a dynamically generated page with Javascript.  It did not seem that
a faculty member teaching five courses per year and a rotating group
of undergraduates could keep up.  And so my research went in other
directions.

Do I think we did useful stuff?  Yes.  Did anyone use it, other than us?
Nope.  Were there significant IP issues, many of which I was not eqiupped
to deal with?  Certainly.  But I did start a side project on how page
authors can provide meta-data on what is and is not reasonable to do
to their page.  Did any of my work have any influence?  Probably not;
most of what I thought should be natural, if you pay enough attention.
I'm just surprised that it took more than a decade for folks to pay
enough attention.

Would I be better known and wealthy if I'd pursued this approach
seriously.?  Perhaps.  People who built new Web technologies did pretty
damn well.  Am I bitter?  Not really.  I love what I do and I'm well
compensated.  But, once in a while, I do wonder what would have happened
if I'd pursued these projects, and others like them [n], more seriously.

[n] Web-based classes in 1994 (including a paper in the 2nd International
WWW conference).  Markdown-like system (Web Raveler) in 1995.  E-commerce
toolkit (for Jessica's Biscuit) in 1996.  Probably a few more I've
forgotten about.

Is there a moral to all this?  Probably not.  I'm just glad that there
are now good annotation toolkits.  I wonder how they deal with pages
that change.  I also wonder if there are good trail-building kits yet.
Does anyone know?

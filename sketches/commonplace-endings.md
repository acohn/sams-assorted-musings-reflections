SamR's Commonplace Page of Endings
==================================

In [an earlier essay](wrapping-up.html), I described my difficulty ending
essays and concluded that I needed to start keeping a Commonplace Book
of endings.  But I lose physical objects.  So I've started a Commonplace
Page of endings.

As I started to pay more attention to endings, I realized that my problem
was not unique.  Strong endings, at least in popular pieces and news articles,
are fairly rare.  Hence, My Commonplace Page includes not only excellent
examples of endings, but also some fairly mediocre endings.

From [an article about dangers of "Smart Cities"](readwrite.com/2016/10/07/unsecured-speeding-cameras-vulnerable-smart-city-hackers-cl4/)

> This follows earlier reports that the U.S. government is increasingly worried that IoT  technology harbors lurking security threats, particularly from terrorists. Various government departments had set up initiatives to assessing the threat posed by this new technology, and to find ways to properly combat next-generation terrorism tactics.

_Should I explain why I find this mediocre?  Let's see ... I'll start
with general issues.  My editor always taught me to avoid "this" as a
pronoun, since it is often ambiguous what "this" refers to.  There's no
direct reference to the reports, so we have no way to check the accuracy
of these claims.  It's not clear whether "Various government had set up
initiatives" is one of the conclusions from the reports, or a separate
claim, or what  In terms of serving as an ending, I worry that it just
seems like the writer just ran out of things to say.  I'd like a more
punchy ending.  "Should we worry?  It seems so."  Or maybe "What
can you do as an individual citizen?  [Securing Smart Cities](https://securingsmartcities.org/) has some resources."  Perhaps that's too much 
advocacy.  But, boy, there has to be something better._

A Van Morrison mixtape
======================

*Topics/tags: [Mixtapes](index-mixtapes)*

At the conclusion of [my short musing about newly-released tapes of
Van Morrison live in 1968](van-boston-1968), I suggested that I should
put together a mixtape of Van songs.  Over a year ago, my kids had asked
taht I start making mixtapes for them.  Unfortunately, I failed at that
endeavor.  But it's worth starting again.  Here goes my attempt at a Van
tape.  It's not close to comprehensive; he has too many years of music
for that.  But it's a start.

1. Something by Them (not just Gloria).  Van got his start in Them.
While "Gloria" was Them's big hit [1]

1. "Madame George" from _Astral Weeks_.  As I mentioned in that prior
musing, I love the way Van repeats words so that they start to lose their
meaning and become more sound patterns or mantras.

1. "Wild Night" from _Tupelo Honey_.  I was tempted to include
"Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)", but I used that
on a prior mixtape.  For some reason, I associate the two songs with
each other, so I'm using this instead.

1. "Brown Eyed Girl" (mono) from _The Authorized Bang Collection_.  In
listening to both the original stereo mix and the original mono mix, I
realize that I prefer the mono mix because it has less of the "claps".

1. Something with the Chieftains.

1. Angeliou

[1] It feels like I should write "their big hit".

A love/hate mix "tape": Things I love that you'll probably hate
===============================================================

My children have asked that I make them mixtapes of music that I enjoy.
Of course, almost no one uses cassette tapes any more and this is just
a list of songs, so I'm calling this a mix "tape".

These are songs that I love that do not naturally fit in the genres of
music that my children like.  Hence, it's a love/hate mixtape.

1. "Los Angeles" by X

1. "That's When I Reach for My Revolver" by Mission of Burma

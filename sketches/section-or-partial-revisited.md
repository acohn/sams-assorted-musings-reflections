Some time ago, I [mused about a design choice for our coverage of
higher-order programming in CSC 151](section-or-partial).  It's
getting close enough to the start of the semester that it's time to
revisit those issues and make a final decision [1].

As you may recall from [a recent musing](compose-or-pipe), I'd been
working on a reading on higher-order procedures intended for the new
version of CSC 151.  Higher-order procedures are procedures that take
other procedures as input, produce procedures as output, or both.  They

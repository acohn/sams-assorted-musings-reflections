Unarchiving some history of CSC 151
===================================

*Topics/tags: [CSC 151](index-151)*

(Sadly, it appears that the series of attacks by ITS and Communications on MathLAN have led Stone to remove his old materials, so I can't find the original.  It used to live at http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~stone/courses/scheme/higher-order-procedures.html.  I thought I might access it through [Walker's site](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~walker/courses/151.sp97/lab-index.html), but that just links to the Stone copy.  [Walker's 1998 version](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~walker/courses/151.fa98/lab-higher-order-proc.html) is around

[Walker's Fall 2000 version](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~walker/courses/151.fa00/lab-higher-order-proc.html) seems different than mine.  Had Stone and Walker started different tracks?

Maybe this is a different musing.  Unarchiving the history of 151.

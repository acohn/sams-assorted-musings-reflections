What do you listen to? part two
===============================

Middle son says _Dad was a hipster before it was cool_.  Let's take
a look at some of the albums and songs I like that almost no one has
heard of.  It's not hard to find things I like that my students have
not heard of.  One of the labs in CSC 151 has the students print out
"Rolling.  Rolling.  Rolling."  I've been known to say both "Rawhide"
and "Rolling on the River" to completely blank looks from my students.

Fire Town

Paul Chastain

Tom Russell (or maybe not)

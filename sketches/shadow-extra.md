Well,
when Middle Son was playing in the yard one day, he broke through the
back door and nearly attacked the boy with whom Middle was playing.
It's only because the kid was incredibly fast and jumped the fence that
he escaped with no more than a bitten hand.  A few weeks later, Shadow
seemed to be walking calmly on the leash.  Then someone came too close
to one of the boys.  No threatening movements.  Nothing.  But Shadow felt
a threat and, well, the person visited the ER.

Tenure line faculty and term faculty, revisited
===============================================

Computer science is doing well at Grinnell.  We're seeing an increase in
the number of majors and, as importantly, in the diversity of the students
who study CS [1].  I increasingly hear about students who choose to attend
Grinnell because of the quality of its CS program [2].

But with success come challenges.  One of our current challenges is
ensuring that we have enough faculty to staff the courses that our
students want or need.  As I've noted elsewhere, getting approval to hire
tenure-line faculty is hard.  The President and Trustees have created a
zero-sum game in which a new tenure-line position in CS means the loss
of a tenure-line position in another department.  Since I value all
of the departments at Grinnell, that proposition is hard to swallow,
no matter how much I'd like a new tenure-line position in my department.
The folks charged with allocating tenure-line positions are also a bit
cautious, since a tenure-line position is essentially a twenty-five-year
commitment [3].

So we're asked to hire folks into term positions.  As [I've noted in a
companion musing](term-faculty), while there are many benefits to term
faculty, most term faculty need some time to get used to teaching at
Grinnell and term faculty cannot serve as academic advisors.  But that's
not what this musing is about.  It's about hiring the term faculty in
the first place.

Most of the folks I talk to treat such hiring as a straightforward or
easy thing.  And that's likely their experience.  In almost every academic
discipline outside of computer science, the number of interested candidates
nationwide [4] far outstrips the number of available positions.  

But that's not our experience.  We generally find it hard to hire a
term faculty member in CS.  And I feel like I have to explain that to
administrators and to colleagues in other departments that again and
again and again

[1] I'm using "diversity" broadly here.  We certainly see embodied diversity
in the genders and other characteristics of our students.  But we also see
important diversity in the multitude of ways that students approach problems
and the discipline in general.

[2] In general, I don't think you should choose to attend a liberal arts
college based on the strength of one program.  But I will also admit that
as a parent of children interested in particular areas, I did consider
how colleges would serve those initial interests while also allowing them
to explore other primary and secondary interests.

[3] That's the party line.  I don't necessarily agree with the party line.
After all, in a healthy department, people are at different levels of
experience, and you can assume that some folks will move on to retirement
or another position in a time that is much less than twenty-five years.

[4] Or worldwide.

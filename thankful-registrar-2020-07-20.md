TL;DR: Our Registrar's Office Staff are amazing.  They've been working
incredibly hard this summer to support our students and our faculty.  
I just want to say **Thank You** to this amazing team.

I added the short note above after writing a much longer musing,
including way too much context.  Here's the original.

This summer has been hard for everyone in academia.  At Grinnell,
we're comparatively fortunate; while we're also worrying about what
the fall will bring, trying to plan for a hybrid college, dealing
with questions from students, families, and colleagues, striving
to maintain the health of our own families, and oh so much more,
we're not (yet) worrying about whether we will continue to be
employed.  I appreciate that Presidents Kington and Harris have
made continued employment of all employees one of their priorities.

Even knowing we'll still be employed, it's been a hard summer, one
that requires a great deal of extra work from everyone.  Faculty
are restructuring courses.  A huge number of people are figuring out
how to prepare for a Grinnell that supports community health with
on-campus students and also gives our remote students a Grinnell-quality
education.  And then there's the switch from semesters to terms,
which is requiring a host of changes and even more communication.

Change is hard.  Change out of your control is worse.  Change amidst
uncertainty is even worse.  And then there's the whole issue of the
pandemic.  A lot of us are grumpy, agitated, frustrated, perhaps
even lashing out from time to time.

I think it's time for us to take a step back and remember that the
others we are working with are also stressed, agitated, frustrated,
more.  And they are working incredibly hard.  So I'm going to add a
few thanks and acknowledgments to my regular mix of rants, musings,
ramblings, and more.

Today I'd like to express my appreciation for the staff of the
Registrar's office.  I don't know all that goes on in a normal
summer at the Registrar's office.  I do know that they have to
gather all the data on the new students and enter it into Colleague.
I know that information comes in and dribs and drabs, so it's
consistent work.  I expect they do a lot of planning.  They probably
handle some questions about spring grades and the effects of spring
grades.

This summer, they've suddenly seen an immense increase in their
workload as they've had to support the transition from semesters
to terms.  Once again, I don't know everything they are doing.  But
I know that they have had to do a lot of immediate planning, to
coordinate with various groups on campus, have needed to gather and
regather data (e.g., "Here's how it looks best to distribute your
classes between Fall 1 and Fall 2; please let us know if you want
to change everything") and enter it in the system, to manage the
complexity of getting the various Ellucian products to deal with a
different model, to safely remove students from the registration
system, to safely switch courses from Fall Semester to Fall Term 1
and Fall Term 2 (delete and re-enter?), and oh so much more.  Soon,
they will have to re-enroll students, paying attention not just to
the courses they were previously enrolled in, but also to how to
manage conflicts.

As far as I can tell, all of that has come at the same time as their
normally busy work dealing with new students.  And they've had to
do it in a compressed timetable, facing the same regular changes
in direction that all of us have faced.  Oh,  yeah, they've also had
to deal with more questions, with angry letters from frustrated faculty,
with confused parents and students, and more.  I do not envy them this
work.  I hope the College has found ways to express its appreciation.

In any case, I'd just like to say a public **Thank You** to the
incredible staff of the Registrar's office.  Thank you for the work
you've done.  Thank you for answering my questions.  Thank you for
supporting our College.  Thank you for the work you will continue
to have to do.  I hope that you've received multiple letters of
acknowledgement.  I hope that you'll get some time to yourselves
when all of this is done.

Thank you.

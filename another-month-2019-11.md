Another month (or two) of (approximately bi-) daily musings
==========================================================

*Topics/tags: [End-of-month musings](index-monthly)*

It's the end of the month.  At the end of the month, I like to reflect
back on what I wrote and learned about writing over the past month.  Since
I did not write an end-of-month musing last month, this musing represents
reflections on two months of daily musings.

I see from my notes that in the first of those months, I mused about
[upgrading my operating system](upgrades-2019-10-02).  I did so
because I needed my OS to support the new two-factor authentication
we are using on our email server.  In doing so, I had to remove and
reset my email account.  I thought it was bad when my email client
said it had 270,000 messages to download.  Two days later, it had
400,000 messages to download.  After five hours in my office, it
had downloaded about a third of those.  In addition, each night I
received a wonderful error message that stopped the download: "The
operation couldn't be completed. (MCMailErrorDomain error 1030.)"
I kept asking myself, "Will it ever finish?"  But finish, it did.
Toward the end of the second month, I upgraded to Catalina.  That's
been an interesting experience.  I expect to muse on that next
month.

For the first time in a while, I took down a musing.  I had written
what I thought was a light-hearted commentary on a significant
issue.  But the musing called out an individual problem, and a
valued colleague thought that was inappropriate.

More broadly, I've been trying to reflect on how to more clearly
target issues rather than individuals.  I know that some people take
offense at what I write.  Particularly given the state of staff
morale, I think it's imperative that I be more careful in what I
write in public [1].

I hear that a few of my musings were posted to [Everyday Class
Notes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/afterpants/).  I'm not in
that group.  I asked once, a few years ago.  However, even though
I'm an honorary member of two classes and have taken multiple courses
at Grinnell, I was not allowed to join.  I may ask again at some
point.  However, I think it's best that I'm not on the group right
now.  Perhaps after I move to SFS.

My musing on [the poor attendance at an excellent
convocation](frustrated-2019-11-21) spurred a lot of discussion on
Facebook.  I'm not sure that we achieved any consensus. Nonetheless,
it's good to see that others felt similarly and that others would
likely support my [innovation fund proposal to explore how we would
make Scholars' Convocation a weekly event](innovation-fund-2019-09-29).

This was the time of year in which I had the opportunity to muse
about [spring registration at Grinnell](prereg-2020S).  At least one
colleague told me that many people look forward to that musing.  I'll
admit that I'm not quite sure why.  It feels a bit dry to me.  "John
Garrison has too many students in his class.  That's not a surprise.
They need five more sections of 100-level studio art.  That's even less
of a surprise."  What makes this genre of musing worth reading?  In
taking a different perspective on this area, I also mused about
[courses I'd like to take](choosing-courses-2019-11-18), [potential
cut, close, and balance issues in CS](ccb-2019-11-17), and [an
unexpected ccb issue](ccb-2019-11-24) [2].  I may muse about the state
of registration after the ccb process ends.

Speaking of the registration musings, I realized that I was writing
enough of those musings that they deserved [their own
category](index-registration).  It took a bit of time to rearrange
things to set up the new category.  I do need to re-architect
the system at some point.  However, it's going to take a bit of work,
given that I have close to 1,000 posted musings as well as a hundred
or two additional partially written musings.  I'd like to say that
I should have paid more attention to the design early on.  However,
it's not clear that I would have understood how the musings and
rants would evolve.

That's a bit about topics and structure.  What about my writing?  I've
certainly reached a point at which I'm comfortable taking regular
breaks from musing.  Usually, I take breaks because I find myself
occupied with other tasks.  But at least once in this period, I just
didn't have the mental energy to muse for a bit more than a week.
In contrast, there were a few days in which I found it more productive
to post two musings each day.  Including this musing and the other
musing that I plan to post today, I will have posted 34 musings over
two months.  I suppose I should call them "bi-daily musings" rather
than "daily musings".

I've noticed that I either have or have developed a habit of asking
questions in a paragraph by themselves.

Is that a problem?

I don't think so.  When writing, I find it useful to set the question
off from the other text as a way to emphasize it.  Maybe it's just
how I approach the world, or what my inner voice [3] says gives me
the right rhythm to what I write.  I wonder how my readers feel.
Maybe I should take Ralph Savarese's _Craft of Creative Nonfiction_
next semester just to reflect on issues like that.  However, while
I would value Ralph's critiques, I'm not sure how I would feel being
in a class full of students less than half my age, most of whom
write significantly better than I do.

On other writing notes, I find that I continue to war with
[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) on the appropriate punctuation
for "not only ... but also" structures.  I like a comma before the
"but also" section.  However, I know that "like" is not a reason
to include a piece of punctuation.  I expect that the comma only
belongs there when there's a complete clause after the "but also".
I need to work on getting that punctuation right.

Grammarly tells me that I use the term "really" too much.  It's right;
I really do.  I'm working on it.

I also learned one new term: "[fisking](fisking-2019-11-25)".  I
wish that it were also a verb, "to fisk", or a role, "a fisker".
But language is malleable [4].  Perhaps if I start using these new
terms, others will, too.  In any case, I also realized that the
way I grade CSC 151 exams represents a type of fisking.  After all,
I regularly insert comments between student work.

It wouldn't be an end-of-month musing unless I included some form of
data.  I did mention the number of musings I had posted over the past
two months.  At that rate, it will take about four more months to
reach the milestone [5] of one-thousand musings.  Perhaps I need to
take fewer days off and double-muse more often.

In contrast, the sketchbook I keep of prospective musings continues
to get larger and larger.  Right now, I have forty listed in the
"short musings" section and twenty-six in the "longer musings"
section.  Those are up sixteen and five, respectively, up from where
I was two months ago.  In thirty days, I plan to set aside the
current sketchbook and open a new one.  How many of the sixty-six
topics for musings will carry over?  That's something to reflect
upon at the end of next month.

What are my plans for the next month of musing?  I've already
suggested that I should increase my average musing frequency to
something a bit closer to daily.  I've noted that I should be more
careful about how I write about others at my institution [6].  I'd
like to cut down on the number of outstanding topics.  After all,
what's the point of a sketchbook if I don't use the sketches [7]?

I owe myself and Council another musing about the anniversary of
Tutorial and the open curriculum [8].  I should reflect on the 
state of post-pre-registration.  I've promised an alum a short note
about my work-for-pay while an undergraduate [9].  Other than that,
my topics are relatively open [10].

[1] It's also important that I am more careful about what I write in
private.  But I can raise issues in private that I should not raise
in public.

[2] I wonder if anyone else uses "ccb" as an abbreviation for "cut,
close, and balance".

[3] muse?

[4] At least English is malleable.

[5] I seem unable to write "milestone" without thinking "millstone".

[6] I've already tried to do so.  I'm not sure that I've been
successful.

[7] Come to think of it, most of the ideas in artists' sketchbooks
don't end up in the final product.

[8] More precisely, I owe council a proposal about that anniversary.
It will just end up as a musing, too.

[9] Have I not written that already?

[10] Or in the sketchbook.

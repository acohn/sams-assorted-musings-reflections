The other day, President Harris wrote to ask me for thoughts about
shared governance at Grinnell.  She'd read [an early rant about the
state of shared governance at Grinnell](shared-governance) and
wondered whether I'd written anything else.  I dug out some other
musings on that or related topics [1], suggested my highest
priorities for rebuilding and enhancing shared governance at Grinnell,
and promised to muse about it again.  This musing represents my
first stab at the last part of the response.  It's not (yet) meant
for public consumption.  I'm not sure if I'll ever release it for
anyone other than President Harris and my family to read.

My opinions and thoughts on shared governance have evolved over the
years, particularly over the past few years.  I am grateful to the many
people who have shaped my thoughts, if not so much for some of the 
events and actions that have also had an impact.

So, what do I think about shared governance at Grinnell?  Right now,
I'm hopeful.  We have a president, a dean, and a chair of the faculty
who are very interested in shared governance at Grinnell [2] and who
appear to work well together.  So I have hope.

At the same time, there's a lot of work to do.  An awful lot of work,
at least from my perspective [3].  The work includes rebuilding trust,
developing a common revised understanding of shared governance, and
putting policies and practices in place to help preserve shared governance.

Trust is central.  I'm pretty sure I've heard President Harris
suggest that it's what makes places like Grinnell run [4].  My trust
in Grinnell is broken, and I expect others find themselves in similar
states.  Faculty don't necessarily trust the administration.  Faculty
and staff don't necessarily trust each other.  Faculty don't
necessarily trust their committees, and vice versa.

It wasn't always this way, or at least it didn't seem so.  For
example, for my first decade or so at Grinnell, I regularly heard
both Student Affairs and the Faculty say that one of the great
strengths of Grinnell was how well the two groups worked together
and respected each other.  I don't hear that as much any more.  For
my first decade or so at Grinnell, committees would make recommendations
that the faculty then vetted; now many committees seem to make
decisions on their own.

So what happened?  A variety of things, many of which I detailed
in [that earlier musing](shared governance) or other musings [5].
Here are a few that come to mind.

* Both President Kington and Dean Latham prioritized representative
  governance over shared governance.  While the two bear many
  similarities (e.g., both involving sharing of governance between
  multiple bodies, most frequently between faculty and administration),
  representative governance removes most of the faculty body from
  deliberation and consideration.  From my perspective, that's
  problematic.  Those working on a committee often develop a shared
  mindset or perspective; by opening discussion to broader discussion,
  we learn new things and consider more perspectives.  It takes
  more time, but it's worth it.  Latham and Kington's prioritization
  of representative governance encouraged committees to make decisions
  without broader consultation.  

* Perhaps because President Kington decided that ITS should report
  to him, rather than to the Dean, and because administrative computing
  seemed to take a priority over academic computing, we've ended up 
  in a situation in which ITS makes major decisions that affect academic
  computing without substantive input or buy-in from the academic side.
  The most obvious situations are the software policy and the academic
  computing equipment policy, at least the first of which was approved
  over strong objections from the Instructional Support Committee.  But
  there have been others.

* Building upon those policies, this past Spring, the President,
  Dean, and Chair of the Faculty made it very clear that they did
  not trust faculty or staff to do the right thing with regards to
  software or FERPA-protected information.  Faculty were told that
  the institution would not support them if they "violated" policies;
  staff were told that they would be terminated in similar situations.
  That's a huge change from past practice, which was, in effect, "We
  trust you to make good decisions and will stand behind you."  But
  when the College leadership says that they do not trust us, and build
  that upon a policy that was built without shared governance, it's
  hard for us to trust them.  I've repeatedly asked for a new statement
  that acknowledges the difficulties of last spring and suggests that
  the institution retracts the earlier statement and will stand behind 
  its faculty and staff.  I have yet to hear one. 

* During the Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers expansion drive,
  faculty and staff were informed that we could not make any public
  statements about the expansion drive.  Then the institution
  released statements that implied that the faculty supported
  Grinnell's anti-unionization stance.  While there were a variety
  of faculty perspectives on the UGSDW, failing to give the faculty
  a real voice on the issue generated anger and unrest.  And I know
  that colleagues at other institutions took the faculty silence
  as a sign of support for the College's perspective.

* Dean Latham promised teaching opportunities to staff members without 
  consulting the faculty.  Since the long-standing practice at
  Grinnell is that courses are only taught by those hired as members
  of the faculty, or those designated as members of the faculty by
  the faculty, the faculty reacted strongly.  Given the other losses
  of shared governance, the faculty reacted particularly strongly
  to what seemed to be yet another infringement upon their "territory".
  And, since staff members had been told they could teach courses,
  they took the response from faculty as a rejection of their
  expertise.

* At the same time that he [significantly grew the number of staff
  on campus](staff-growth-2020-02-16), President Kington refused to
  even consider growing the number of tenure-line faculty.  It
  strikes me that when you have a limited budget (and yes, everyone
  has a limited budget), you should consider trade-offs between
  different positions, rather than arbitrarily dismissing one type
  of position.  And by refusing to consider additional positions,
  Kington effectively pit different departments against each other
  for positions [6].

* While making misleading statements about the cost of Grinnell's
  Senior Faculty Status program, President Kington not only
  suspended it for a year, but soured the trustees on it.  As I
  understand it, he made the decision without consulting the SFS
  committee, nor Council, nor, I hear, the Dean.

* In retrospect, I find myself concerned about the process for deciding
  to increase the number of international students from 10% of the
  student body to 20% of the student body.  It was sold to the
  faculty as a way to diversify or further globalize Grinnell but
  it's clear that the College did so to decrease the discount rate.
  I love all that our international students bring to the College,
  but I wish the administration had been honest about the reasons
  [7].  (This paragraph will disappear in the released version.)

There are more, but it seems like enough for now.  Looking back,
it seems that the administration made some important decisions that
pit different groups against each other (faculty could not speak
about USGDW, which affected trust between students and faculty;
limited faculty lines pit faculty against each other; the teaching
issue pits faculty and staff against each other).  I don't think
any of this was intentional [9], but it certainly had negative
effects.

So, what should shared governance look like at Grinnell?  As I've
noted before, shared governance needs to be more inclusive.
Traditionally, shared governance is governance shared between the
Trustees, the Administration, and the Faculty.  We need to more
explicitly include both staff and students in that sharing.  Grinnell
has done a comparatively good job of including students, so much so
that non-faculty outnumber faculty on the Curriculum Committee [10].
But staff have traditionally been excluded.  [I don't know how best
to involve staff in governance](governance-tenure-2020-01-19), but
we need to make it an explicit and shared priority.

Of course, to give staff more authority, others have to give up some
of their authority.  And that's hard.  In particular, I think the
faculty have to sacrifice some of our authority and acknowledge how
staff can and should participate, contribute, and lead.  Given 
our country's broader discussion about how those with privilege
need to give up some of that privilege so that others may have it,
this may be the time.  But it will be hard for faculty to give up 
authority after losing so much, so perhaps some of that has to be
restored first.

Beyond broader sharing in shared governance, what else should we
consider?  As I've noted, we need to reflect on the differences between
representative governance and shared governance, at least on the
faculty side.  I think of many instances in which a committee made a
major recommendation, only to find it significantly modified or
rejected by the faculty.  Here are a few.

* Council originally proposed end-of-course evaluations as tools for
  assessing faculty for tenure/promotion and salary decisions.
  When the proposal came to the faculty, the faculty rejected their
  use for salary decisions.
* Council originally proposed end-of-course evaluations as only a
  set of Likert-style questions.  When the proposal came to the
  faculty, the faculty voted to include free-response sections, with
  the understanding that only the faculty member and their chair
  would read those sections.
* The Study-Abroad Committee decided to add breadth requirements for
  students studying abroad.  Eventually, the faculty required that the
  policy come to a faculty vote and voted down those requirements.
* More recently, Council proposed that we suspend the use of
  end-of-course evaluations in evaluative processes because they
  have been shown to be biased [11].  Surprisingly, the faculty voted
  to retain EOCEs, although only to identify statistical outliers
  [12].

There are certainly others.  

Given these situations, I've been surprised at the times that
committees have decided to modify rules without consulting the
faculty at large.  Personnel Committee claimed the right to view
comments on EOCEs.  Curriculum Committee claimed the right to rule
on changes in course capacity [14].

Let's see ... Rebuild Trust.  Broaden our definition of shared
governance to better include staff.  Better distinguish between
representative governance and shared governance. More broadly,
incorporate more voices in shared governance.  What else?  I see
I added one more thing in my letter to President Harris:
*Prioritize the academic program in decisions*.  That should be
obvious, shouldn't it?

**_Postscript_**: Here are the links I shared with President Harris, in 
no particular order.

[New computing policies](computing-policies-2019-09-16)
  : I wrote this one a bit more than a year ago, finding myself
    frustrated by the two then-new policies on software and
    computing equipment.  I've since gotten some explanations
    about the computing equipment (e.g., that ITS doesn't have a
    budget line for buying equipment for term faculty and the College
    decided to prioritize the budget over the teaching experience
    of term faculty).  However, events of the spring, summer, and
    fall suggests that my concerns about the software policy were
    warranted.

[Criticizing faculty proposals](criticizing-faculty-proposals)
  : Sam in full-rant mode about someone saying "Why can't you trust
    your fellow faculty?"  More on the "shared governance vs
    representative governance front".

[Distrust](distrust)
  : What appears to be a draft musing about distrust of the administration,
    back from when I was previously department chair.  Wow; that's a long
    time ago.  I am struck that we still haven't done anything public
    with the "opportunities for research for all" [15].  SHACS (now SHAW)
    seems to be doing much better; at least I'm not hearing as many
    student concerns.

[Governance, tenure, and such](governance-tenure-2020-01-19)
  : One of my first in-depth attempts to better reflect on how to
    better involve staff in shared governance.  I marked this as
    one of the more important things I'd written.

[PCard Privacy](pcard-privacy)
  : Hmmm.  This might be another draft musing.  Privacy and the P-Card 
    system seems to be one of those things that very few of us care
    about.  But the faculty were promised privacy for ourselves and
    the students.  Then ITS made changes.  I think Student
    Affairs made changes.  And data were abused [16].  People should
    care about privacy more.

[Shared governance, revisited](shared-governance-revisited-2017-04-13)
  : A followup to the message that President Harris found online [17].
    I don't seem very positive in this musing.

[Shared governance](shared-governance-2018-02-03)
  : A new, comparatively short, musing about shared governance, written
    in response to one of Kington's editorials about shared governance.

[Distributed knowledge](distributed-knowledge-2019-09-13)
  : While not directly about shared knowledge, this musing provides
    some thoughts about an issue that may have affected shared
    governance: The Dean's decision to offload some committee work
    meant that he had much less knowledge of the day-to-day activities
    of the College, which I think affects the long-term prioritization
    of the academic program.

Are there others?  Almost certainly.  But I assumed that all of that
would overwhelm President Harris already.

[1] You'll find them in a postscript.

[2] Arguably, all of the chairs of the faculty have been interested
in shared governance at Grinnell.

[3] As I tell my students, everything you write is from your perspective.
So I could probably drop that aside.  But then I'd have to drop this
endnote, and I've become fond of it.

[4] Or maybe she said it's what allows Grinnell to run, or one of the
things that make Grinnell great, or something like that.

[5] I'll list some other relevant musings in an appendix.

[6] I'm in a department that needs more faculty to support student
demand.  But, as I've said many times, I don't think we should cut
faculty core liberal arts subjects to give us the faculty we need
in our department.  If Grinnell is committed to both providing a
genuine liberal education and to allowing students to select any major
they want, it needs to grow the faculty.

[7] I appreciate that President Kington was honest about our reliance
on international students in one of his State of the College [8] talks.

[8] Iowa.

[9] At least I hope it wasn't intentional.

[10] On the faculty side, we have three elected members of the faculty
and the Chair of the faculty.  On the non-faculty side, we have four
students, the Registrar, and the Dean or a designated representative.
I'm sorry, but faculty should have primary oversight of the curriculum.
And there should also be a staff member on board.  That reminds me,
I feel like we need a proposal to change the membership of Curriculum
Committee.

[11] In particular, women and people teaching large classes
statistically tend to receive lower scores.  It's likely that people
of color also receive lower scores, but there are not enough data
to demonstrate that difference.  At least that's what I recall.

[12] At least that's what I recall.

[14] When I complained about that not going before the full faculty,
an Associate Dean wrote something like, "Sam, why don't you trust your
colleagues?"  I feel the same way: Why doesn't CC trust the faculty 
enough to put this important change before the faculty?

[15] We did make "provide research opportunities for students" a
requirement for full-year sabbaticals, and Curriculum Committee is
currently looking on clarifying other individual study issues
(perhaps to distinguish them from research?), but we haven't, say
given the research opportunities the same standing in the catalog
that honors has.  We haven't even set up Web pages that summarize
the kinds of research opportunities each department provides.  Given
the many hours we spent on that work, it's disappointing that the
College did not move forward.

[16] Use of passive intentional.

[17] "That President Harris found online" modifies "the message" rather
than "a followup to".

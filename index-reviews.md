Reviews and notes about things I enjoy
======================================

*Eventually, I'll find that I'm out of serious topics and will instead
start writing about some of the things that are meaningful to me, or
at least provide joy.  (Other than my family.)  I'm starting a list.
I'm also including some reviews here, since I generally only review
things I enjoy.*

[Cyro Baptista and Banquet of Spirits](cyro-baptista) (Essay #51)

> Reflections on an awesome concert.

[The Straight Dope](straight-dope) (Musing #669)

> Farewell to a favorite.

[_The Last Days of Jack Sparks_](jack-sparks) (Musing #682)

> Why did I decide to read a horror novel?

[_The Shakespeare Requirement_](shakespeare-requirement) (Musing #757)

> Not as good as its predecessor.

[The Association in concert](the-association) (Musing #765)

> Everyone's favorite _Big Chill_ cover band.

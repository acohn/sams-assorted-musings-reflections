As I mentioned in [a recent musing](post-prereg-2020F), some time
around prereg [1] period each semester, I muse about what I see in
the registration numbers and how I think departments might deal
with over-enrolled courses.  It appears that I have some fans of this
genre of musing, including among people whose writing and intellects
I admire highly.  Some even tell me that they look forward to those
kinds of musings.

I'm trying to figure out why.

It's definitely not the quality of writing.  Those musings are
perhaps the ones guided most by the ways in which my mind goes.  I
would say they follow my train of thought, but that implies something
somewhat linear.  They ramble, to put it politely.  I tend to pay
less attention to my sentence structure [2] and word choice [3].
Since they are so long, I rarely have the time or energy to do any
substantial editing.

Are the data interesting [4]?  They are, to me.  But those data are
easily available to all, or at least all on campus, and in a form
unencumbered by my additional words.   I don't tend to organize them
in any particularly clever way.  Perhaps alphabetically, but department.
Perhaps in terms of course size.

It may be that my readers like seeing their names.  I respect my
colleagues highly, and sometimes include compliments or chatter.
I believe my colleagues know of my respect, but it's still nice to
see it grounded in text, even poorly written text [5].

It may be that they appreciate my vast experience and expertise at
considering what happens to over-enrolled courses [6].  I know I like
trying to figure out what will or might happen.  I wish I know more
about the practices of other departments; I have learned mostly
from observation and a few off-hand comments.  Since we can benefit
from hearing the practices of others, it may be that they see that
benefit in my musings, even if they are mostly hypotheses rather
than conclusions.

One of my friends from outside Grinnell says that they appreciate how
these musings "show a commitment to the students, faculty, and staff
at Grinnell". I'm not sure if that's my commitment or the College's
commitment. Perhaps both.

I like that these types of musings help me learn, or re-learn.  It's
good to be reminded that it's okay that, say, to kick twenty students
out of CSC-301 this semester because I know there will be room for
them in the spring.  It's also good for me to reflect on whether
that means we should swap the two-section semester from spring to
fall.  I'm fairly explicit about what I learn or see.  Maybe that's
fun.  Or maybe it's fun to jest at how little I know or realize.  One
never knows.

I'll almost certainly keep writing these semesterly musings, if only
for that small audience and for myself.  But I would like to know what
reasons lead people to read and even to anticipate.

**_Postscript_**: Over the years, I've learned that people approach
the schedule of courses very differently than I do.  I tend to keep
a watch on the schedule to help my advisees and to look for trouble
spots in our department (both low enrollments and high enrollments).
I had thought everyone did that, but that appears not to be the
case.  I had also assumed that those folks who teach the incredibly
popular classes pay attention so they can see just how popular they
are.  That also appears not to be the case.  I guess I need to accept
that my approach to the world is, perhaps, atypical.

**_Postscript_**: Here are some of the comments I received in response
to this musing.

_This section currently blank_.

---

[1] Preliminary Registration.  Students register for classes that we pretend
have no limits.  Then we impose limits.

[2] Believe it or not, but I do pay some attention to my sentence structures.
I pay more attention now that _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_ has given
me tools and encouragement to do so.

[3] Ditto.

[4] I know, I should not use the word "interesting".  Since I give
the advice to my students, I should follow it myself.

[5] Am I straying into humble brag territory or whatever they call it?

[6] How's that as a recovery?

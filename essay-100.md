My One Hundredth Essay of the Day
=================================

*Forthcoming.*

Notes:

If you read the essays each day, you'll know that a few days ago,
[I asked my readers to submit their favorite essays](closing-in-on-100.html).
I thought that putting together this essay would provide some broader
context to new readers and would give long-term readers a chance to 
contribute back.  Here's what they came up with.

> JR writes _So from now on when people ask me why tenure is so amazing I'm showing them [this essay](closing-in-on-100.html)._

> JLND writes _Probably my favorite essay is [#85](ndd-01.html) [1,2] because I can relate all too well._

What's my favorite?  Essays are a bit like children.  It seems inappropriate
to claim I have a favorite [1].

[1] Sam notes that essay #85 is entitled "Nibbled to death by ducks, episode 
1."

[2] Sam, not JLND, inserted these endnotes.

[1] Middle son says that I regularly claim to have a favorite, but I doubt
that [2].  My sons, on the other hand, all regularly claim to be the favorite
[3].

[2] Well, there have been times I've reacted to something by threatening
to label one of my sons as the least favorite.

[3] Interestingly, each son also claims to be less smart than the other
two sons.

"The Google Thing"
==================

*Topics/tags: [Meta musings](index-meta), short*

I recently wrote about some
musings that I would never write.  Along the way, I noted that I
had a note that said "Application for Google thingy?" and I had no
memory of what it meant.  But I use Git [1] to store my musings, so I could
go back and look when I'd added the line.  I added it on October 15, 2016,
along with a bunch of other musings [2].  So it kind of makes sense that I've
forgotten.  I forget things I was planning a month ago, let alone nearly
two years ago.  I could look back at my email from then for a clue.  I
can think of two options: I'd been on a Google education advisory committee,
and I was considering whether to volunteer for more work [3].  I also
regularly think about asking Google for support for our local code club.

[1] More on Git in another musing.

[2] I see that I planned a musing on Git even before then.

[3] Amazingly, I decided not to do so.

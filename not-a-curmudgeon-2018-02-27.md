Maybe I'm not a curmudgeon
==========================

I call myself a curmudgeon.  I seem to have all the requisite traits.
I'm an old white [1] guy.  I complain a lot.  Isn't that what a
curmudgeon is?  Let's see ... Merriam-Webster says that a curmudgeon is
"_a crusty, ill-tempered, and usually old man_" [3].  However, I don't
think that I'm a pie, so I should see what else "crusty" means.  Ah,
"_giving an effect of surly incivility in address or disposition_"
[4,5].  Yup, anyone whose seen me talk to certain folks at a faculty
meeting would say that I have that effect.

But I've had a number of recent experiences that make me question my
curmudgeonly credentials.

I was talking to a faculty member at another institution about the large
rise in administrative positions at our institutions, a rise that is 
particularly frustrating because our institutions would both benefit from
more faculty.  But I've generally accepted the claim that "We had
deferred administrative maintenance"; the world is a much more complex
place than it was twenty years ago, and more administrators are needed
to handle additional regulations and student expectations.  In contrast,
my friend, in a faculty meeting in which they were discussing what to
do about the rise in administrators, said something like "Maybe they could
all just die."  I don't think I'd ever say anything like that.

And even at Grinnell, I seem to be a bit calmer about particular changes.
Our office of Careers, Life, and Service has expanded by more than a
dozen people in the past few years.  My response?  "We should be paying
attention to our students' ability to get jobs, particularly if we want
to continue to support students from a variety of economic backgrounds."
So I support the growth in CLS [6].  And when a colleague says something
like "Student affairs is engaging in empire building", I respond with
"My experience is that the folks in student affairs care deeply about
our students and are doing what they think is right."

These days, I even seem to be polite, even when I have things that I
should be curmudgeonly about, like the Dean's office failing to forward
a response from the Dean to an urgent question (even though he responded
promptly) or someone's failure to forward along important paperwork,
thereby setting off a series of complicating delays [7].

And at SIGCSE, I generally acted as the "good cop" of the pair of 
student-volunteer coordinators.

Maybe I'm not the curmudgeon that I claim to be.

Oh well.  I'm still keeping my name tag.

[1] Given that the white power movement does not consider me white, I'm
beginning to question whether I should continue to describe myself that way.
I tend to have the privileges associated with a light skin tone.  But I
also have people who assume that I'm Jewish [2] and treat me differently
because of that.

[2] And I am, at least culturally.

[5] Why did they use "crusty" in the definition of "curmudgeon".  Couldn't
they have just included the concept?

[6] However, I do not accept President Kington's unsupported assertion that
the growth in CLS is responsible to for growth in applications and applicant
quality.  I'm working on a piece that suggests that the quality of CS has
a more direct impact.  After all, it's not the phrase "Careers" that people
search for most often on the Grinnell Web site.

[7] Does mentioning them in this musing raise my curmudgeonly status?
I've only commented vaguely.

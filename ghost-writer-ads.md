Advertisements for ghostwriters
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), rambly, language, long*

For some reason, I've started getting email messages advertising
ghostwriting services.  I knew my writing wasn't great.  However, I hadn't
realized that it was of a caliber that suggests I need a ghostwriter [1].
Or perhaps it's that the InterWeb has figured out that I'm friends with
someone who does a bit of ghostwriting and thought that means I was
looking for one.

Here's the email that I received.

Fascinating, isn't it?  Ignoring the bigger issues (e.g., that one who hires
a ghostwriter is not really an "author" and that it is unlikely that Edison,
Twain, King, and Rowling hired ghostwriters [2,3]), I'm not sure why anyone
would hire someone so given to hyperbole and challenged in style and grammar
[4].

Just for fun, I'll sic [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) on their text.

Are you ready?    I know that I am!

**Looking forward to hear from you ASAP!**

> hear -> hearing

> The verb **hear** is usually in the gerund form when following
the word **Looking forward to** [5].  Consider replacing it with the
**-ing** form.

_Good advice. [6]_

**We believe in your ideas and it is time to turn them into reality!**

> , and

> It appears that you are missing a comma before the coordinating
conjunction **and** in a compound sentence.  Consider adding a comma.

_I agree that the sentence is poorly phrased.  I'd suggest a more significant
edit because the two parts of the sentence are so disjoint._

**Right from the initial stages to the moment when you open your book for the first time, our diligent ghostwriter, editor and a seasoned consultant will be at your service to ensure perfection in your publication.**

> , and

> Your sentence contains a series of three or more words, phrases, or clauses.
Consider adding a comma to separate the elements.

_It's nice to know that Grammarly believes in the Oxford comma.  But it's also
a weird sentence.  Do they only have one diligent ghostwriter?  Why isn't
there an article with "editor"?_

**This is what we have been doing for decades and we are the best in business.**

> , and

> It appears that you are missing a comma before the coordinating
conjunction **and** in a compound sentence.  Consider adding a comma.

_I appreciate that Grammarly is grouping all the criticisms of "and".
Once again, I'd suggest a different change.  Perhaps a semicolon.  They
also need "the best in *the* business*, but I assume Grammarly will 
come back to that issue later. [7]_

**Our services are highly recommended by various renowned online publishers, including Google Books, Amazon, Ingram and Barnes and Noble.**

> , and

> Your sentence contains a series of three or more words, phrases, or clauses.
Consider adding a comma to separate the elements.

_In case you weren't sure, Grammarly dislikes the "and" in "Barnes and
Noble".  That's wrong.  But the recommendation for an Oxford comma is
appropriate. [8]_

**Hello Samuel Rebelsky ,**

> Rebelsky , -> Rebelsky,

> It appears that you have improperly spaced some punctuation.  Consider 
removing a space.

_I'd missed that.  Good catch!  (And careless formatting, Richard Brown!
That's yet another reason I won't hire you.)_

**About Ghost Writing LLC .**

> LLC . -> LLC.

> It appears that you have improperly spaced some punctuation.  Consider 
removing a space.

_Shouldn't there be a comma before LLC?  My quick search of the InterWeb
suggests that either is acceptable.  Of course, most of that advice comes
from lawyers rather than writers, so it should be taken with a grain
of salt._

**But do you find it hard to make time and put your ideas down on paper?**

> ideas -> thoughts

> The word **ideas** appears repeatedly in this text.  Consider using a
synonym in its place.

_'Eh.  I see some value in repetition, at least in this piece.  I also expect
that clients will want their "ideas" rather than "thoughts" recorded._

**It was this very thought that got things going for popular figures like Thomas Edison, Mark Twain, Stephen King, Bills Gates and J. K. Rowling.**

> popular -> famous

> The word **popular** is often overused.  Consider using a more specific
synonym to improve the sharpness of your writing.

_I'm not sure whether **famous** is more appropriate for this audience.
I'd also replace "figures" with "writers" or "authors", since that's
the focus of the advertisement._

And that's it?  Wow.  Grammarly let me down.  It didn't identify the
grammatical errors I mentioned earlier.  It missed the repeated use of
"to be" verbs (e.g., "It is time ... It was this ...").  It missed the
use of "this" as a pronoun ("This is what ...") [9].

What next?  Let's see what Microsoft Word suggests!

**Hello Samuel Rebelsky ,**

*Word also wants them to drop the space.*

**As a part of our promotional week (ending today), we are offering you this once in a lifetime chance to become a Best Selling Author in the U.S and other parts of the world by bringing your ideas to life.**

*Word suggests hyphenating "Best-Selling".  I'm surprised that it doesn't
suggest a change in capitalization.  And isn't "once-in-a-lifetime" supposed
to be hyphenated? [10]*

Um, that's it.  And I thought Grammarly let me down.  I guess the world
needs better writing tools [14].

Wait a minute!  I may have configured Grammarly for the musings.
Let's see ... My intent is to "Inform".  I can keep that.  My audience is
"General".  I can keep that.  My style is "Informal".  Perhaps I should
change that to "Formal".  My emotion is "Mild".  While their text is
filled with bold and all-caps, we'll pretend that they want to be mild,
too.  My domain is "General".  I guess there was only one setting to change.
Or perhaps I can clear all of the goals and see what happens.

Let's see what new criticisms [16] Grammarly can come up with.

**If you have what it takes to become a top-selling published author.**

> *Sentence fragment*

> This appears to be an incomplete sentence.  Consider rewriting the
sentence or connecting the fragment with another sentence.

*I'm glad to see that Grammarly **does** catch some incomplete sentences.
I'm surprised that it ignores them in informal writing.*

**Ghost Writing LLC is a premium ghostwriting and publishing services are aimed at assisting you to achieve your professional writing and publishing goals.**

> *Passive voice*

> This sentence appears to be written in the passive voice [17].  Consider
writing in the active voices.

*A reasonable recommendation.  Let's see.  Perhaps "We aim to assist
you ...".*

**This is what we have been doing for decades and we are the best in business.**

> *Unclear antecedent.*

> It may be unclear who or what *This* refers to.  Consider rewriting the
sentence to remove the unclear reference.

*I'm glad to see that Grammarly caught the "This".*

**Our services are highly recommended by various renowned online publishers, including Google Books, Amazon, Ingram and Barnes and Noble.**

> *Passive voice*

> This sentence appears to be written in the passive voice.  Consider
writing in the active voices.

**Looking forward to hearing from you ASAP!**

> *Sentence fragment*

> This appears to be an incomplete sentence.  Consider rewriting the
sentence or connecting the fragment with another sentence.

*I wouldn't be as concerned about that one.*

And that's it.  Grammarly missed some things that I'd catch.  But
that's life.  

Oh, I do have one more tool!  Linux spell check suggests that 
"statured" is misspelled.  In rereading the text, I think it's
just that it's the wrong word.  "Statured" is a valid word, but
not really in this context.

In any case, We have established that the folks at Ghost Writing LLC
aren't even up to the standards of these tools.

Postscript: Note that I am not opposed to the concept of ghostwriting.
While I would not hire a ghostwriter, I do understand that they can
provide useful services.  And, as I said, I do have a friend who does
some ghostwriting [18].  But Ghost Writing, LLC is clearly not worth
hiring, even at an 85% discount [19].

[1] Or "ghost writer".

[2] What about Gates?  I'm less certain.  I've heard of Bill Gates.  But
I'm not sure who this "Bills Gates" person is.  

[3] Come to think of it, I'm not so sure about Edison, either.  He was known
to claim the work of his underlings.

[4] The two "sentences" that stick out to me are "Ghost Writing LLC is
a premium ghostwriting and publishing services are aimed at assisting
you to achieve your professional writing and publishing goals" and
"If you have what it takes to become a top-selling published author".

[5] Dear Grammarly: I'm pretty sure that "Looking forward to" is not a word.

[6] However, Grammarly is critical of its own text.  It notes,

> It appears that the phrase *hear is* contains an unnecessary verb.  Review
the sentence to determine the appropriate correction.

[7] I was wrong; it did not.

[8] When I inserted the comma after "Ingram", Grammarly closed the complaint.

[9] One of my early editors regularly commented on my use of "this" as a
pronoun.  It's a good piece of advice, and I've carried that caution into my 
own editing.

[10]
[Grammarist](http://grammarist.com/usage/once-in-a-lifetime-vs-once-in-a-lifetime/)
[11] suggests it should be hyphenated when used
as an adjective.  Some random [Free English Punctuation
Guide](https://sites.google.com/site/punctuationguide/Home/the-hyphen-in-punctuation)
also agrees, even though it phrases it as "one in a lifetime" [12].

[11] Not to be confused with Grammarly.

[12] If they can't get the phrase right or consistent, should they
be trusted?  Their analysis of under-graduate in the next paragraph is
also awkward.  However, their rationale that "Using hyphens make these
multi-word compound adjectives makes them easier to read" is good,
although perhaps not sufficient.

[14] Perhaps I just need access to better writing tools [15].

[15] editing tools, critiquing tools, style tools, grammar tools ...
whatever you want to call them.

[16] suggestions, observations, whatever.

[17] Grammarly also thinks that it's own sentence appears to be written
in the passive voice.

[18] No, I won't tell you who it is.

[19] Of course, the fact that the firm that needs to give discounts on 
their services suggests something.

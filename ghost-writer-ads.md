Advertisements for ghost writers
================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), rambly, language, long*

For some reason, I've started getting email messages advertising ghost
writing services.  I knew my writing wasn't great.  But I hadn't realized
that it was of a calibre that suggests I need a ghost writer.  Or perhaps
it's that the InterWeb has figured out that I'm friends with someone who
does a bit of ghost writing and thought that means I was looking for one.

Here's the email that I received.

Fascinating, isn't it?  Ignoring the bigger issues (e.g., that one who hires
a ghost writer is not really an "author" and that it is unlikely that Edison,
Twain, King, and Rowling hired ghost writers [1,2]), I'm not sure why anyone
would hire someone so given to hyperbole and challenged in style and grammar
[3].

Just for fun, I'll sic [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) on their text.

Are you ready?    I know that I am!

**Looking forward to hear from you ASAP!**

> hear -> hearing

> The verb **hear** is usually in the gerund form when following
the word **Looking forward to** [4].  Consider replacing it with the
**-ing** form.

_Good advice._

**We believe in your ideas and it is time to turn them into reality!**

> , and

> It appears that you are missing a comma before the coordinating
conjunction **and** in a compound sentence.  Consider adding a comma.

_I agree that the sentence is poorly phrased.  I'd suggest a more extreme
edit as the two parts of the sentence are so disjoint._

**Right from the initial stages to the moment when you open your book for the first time, our diligent ghostwriter, editor and a seasoned consultant will be at your service to ensure perfection in your publication.**

> , and

> Your sentence contains a series of three or more words, phrases, or clauses.
Consider adding a comma to separate the elements.

_It's nice to know that Grammarly believes in the Oxford comma.  But it's also
a weird sentence.  Do they only have one dilligent ghostwriter?  Why isn't
there an article with "editor"?_

**This is what we have been doing for decades and we are the best in business.**

> , and

> It appears that you are missing a comma before the coordinating
conjunction **and** in a compound sentence.  Consider adding a comma.

_I appreciate that Grammarly is grouping all the criticisms of "and".
Once again, I'd suggest a different change.  Perhaps a semicolon.  They
also need "the best in *the* business*, but I assume Grammarly will 
come back to that issue later. [5]_

**Our services are highly recommended by various renowned online publishers, including Google Books, Amazon, Ingram and Barnes and Noble.**

> , and

> Your sentence contains a series of three or more words, phrases, or clauses.
Consider adding a comma to separate the elements.

_In case you weren't sure, Grammarly dislikes the "and" in "Barnes and
Noble".  That's wrong.  But the recommendation for an Oxford comma is
appropriate. [6]_

**Hello Samuel Rebelsky ,**

> Rebelsky , -> Rebelsky,

> It appears that you have improperly spaced some punctuation.  Consider 
removing a space.

_I'd missed that.  Good catch!  (And careless formatting, Richard Brown!
That's yet another reason I won't hire you.)_

**About Ghost Writing LLC .**

> LLC . -> LLC.

_Shouldn't there be comma before LLC?  My quick search of the InterWeb
suggests that either is acceptable.  Of course, most of that advice comes
from lawyers rather than writers, so it should be taken with a grain
of salt._

**But do you find it hard to make time and put your ideas down on paper?**

> ideas -> thoughts

> The word **ideas** appears repeatedly in this text.  Consider using a
synonym in its place.

_'Eh.  I see some value in repetition, at least in this piece.  I also expect
that clients will want their "ideas" rather than "thoughts" recorded._

**It was this very thought that got things going for popular figures like Thomas Edison, Mark Twain, Stephen King, Bills Gates and J. K. Rowling.**

> popular -> famous

> The word **popular** is often overused.  Consider using a more specific
synonym to improve the sharpness of your writing.

_I'm not sure whether **famous** is more appropriate for this audience.
But I'd replace "figures" with "writers" or "authors", since that's
the focus of the advertisement._

And that's it?  Wow.  Grammarly let me down.  It didn't identify the
grammatical errors I mentioned earlier.  It missed the repeated use of
"to be" verbs (e.g., "It is time ... It was this ...").  It missed the
use of "this" as a pronoun ("This is what ...") [7].

What next?  Let's see what Microsoft Word suggests!

Postscript: Note that I am not opposed to the concept of ghostwriting.
While I would not hire a ghostwriter, I do understand that they can
provide useful services.  And, as I said, I do have a friend who does
some ghostwriting [n].  But Ghost Writing, LLC is clearly not worth
hiring.

[n] No, I won't tell you who it is.

---

[1] What about Gates?  I'm less certain.  I've heard of Bill Gates.  But
I'm not sure who this "Bills Gates" person is.  

[2] Come to think of it, I'm not so sure about Edison, either.  He was known
to claim the work of his underlings.

[3] The two "sentences" that stick out to me are "Ghost Writing LLC is
a premium ghostwriting and publishing services are aimed at assisting
you to achieve your professional writing and publishing goals" and
"If you have what it takes to become a top-selling published author".

[4] Dear Grammarly: I'm pretty sure that "Looking forward to" is not a word.

[5] I was wrong; it did not.

[6] When I inserted the comma after "Ingram", Grammarly closed the complaint.

[7] One of my early editors regularly commented on my use of "this" as a
pronoun.  It's a good piece of advice and I've carried that caution into my 
own editing.

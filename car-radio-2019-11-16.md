Car radio

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), music*

When I take long drives, I tend to listen to the radio.  What I
listen to varies.  Often, I listen to NPR.  Sometimes, I just roam
the dial, searching for something of interest.  This weekend, I
drove to Chicago and back.  On the way there, I was able to listen
to much of Maria Yovanovitch's testimony [1].  On the way home, I
listened to various NPR programs until I hit the DeKalb Oasis, when
I lost WBEZ.  At that point, I started scanning the dial.  I was
surprised at the number of religious stations I heard, as well as the
number of Spanish-language stations.

Strangely enough, one of the Spanish-language stations played a
short bit of "Edge of Seventeen".  I was hoping that they'd continue
with a Spanish-language version.  No such luck.  However, about
thirty minutes later, I caught the tail end on an oldies station.
I thought it might be a cover because it seemed a bit harder than
I remembered.  But,  well, it was an oldies station.  They are
unlikely to play covers.

Then I hit the jackpot.  I heard a song that sounded like Phil Ochs.
So I started listening to what turned out to be
[WVIK](https://www.wvik.org).  Next up was another union song, Joe
Jencks singing Si Kahn's "You are the 'U' in Union"  Then an
a cappella union song, Jon Fromer's "We Do the Work".  I thought I was
going to get lots of union songs, but they quickly switched to 
a cover of Son House's walking blues and a wide variety of other
songs, often three or four songs on a similar topic.  I discovered
when I got home that they were playing [an episode of _The Midnight
Special_](https://beta.prx.org/stories/297451) from WFMT [2].  After
that, they transitioned to [an episode of _Celtic Connections_ on
the music of the Civil
War](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rxspb812rh5bcvv/celtic-connections-17-26.doc?dl=0)
[3].

In another bit of coincidence, that show opened with "The Battle
Cry of Freedom".  My brain kept telling me that I knew a union song
with the same tune.  I had been saying to myself that my mother
would have been able to identify the song [4].  However, when I got
home, I was able to figure out that it was Billy Bragg's "There is
Power in a Union" [5].  I don't think mom would have known that one.

In any case, I was quite grateful for ninety minutes of music I enjoyed [6].
I hope I'm as lucky next time I drive alone [7].

Postscript: The highlight of an earlier trip was [an episode of _This
American Life_](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/239/lost-in-america) 
with a segment by Sarah Vowell on the origins of "The Battle Hymn of
the Republic" with music by Jon Langford.  I need to remember to
play a part of that piece for my family.

[1] IPR was playing it, so I could hear it through Iowa and into
Western Illinois.  The NPR stations I hit next were playing some
other show, rather than the testimony.  When I got closer to Chicagoland,
I was able to return to the testimony on WBEZ.

[2] In discovering that, I also learned that the show has an [interesting
policy about posting their playlists](http://www.midnightspecial.org/policy.htm).

> Upon closer reading of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), our attorneys requested that we not post a playlist for a _Midnight Special_ current streaming. Thus, as each program finishes its week of archive streaming, the playlist for that program will be posted. We apologize for the inconvenience. Because we own the rights to our _Folkstage_ concerts, we will continue to post those the day after the broadcast.

I wonder if the attorneys worry that someone armed with a playlist could
then get a copy of the songs in the episode.

[3] As I searched for info about _Celtic Connections_, I was sad
to discover that Bryan Kelso Crow, the host of the show, recently
passed away.

[4] There are a bunch of union songs that were written to the tunes
of popular songs.  Certainly, that was one of Woody Guthrie's
techniques.  For example, Wikipedia tells me that "[Union
Maid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Maid)", which is one of
my favorite songs, is to the tune of Kerry Mills' "Red Wing", which
is itself adapted from a Schumann composition.

[5] No, not the Joe Hill song.  In the continuing world of coincidences,
I'd read a poem earlier in the day entitled "I dreamed I saw Joe Wall",
which was clearly riffing on "I dreamed I saw Joe Hill".

[6] Okay, it was more like 85 minutes of music plus 5 minutes of a Bruce
Springsteen monologue.

[7] The rest of my family has different taste in music than I do.
We might have agreed on _Celtic Connections_, but the _Midnight
Special_ tracks would generally not have been something they
preferred.

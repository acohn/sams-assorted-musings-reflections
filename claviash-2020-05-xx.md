The other day, I was thinking about my parents and about card games.
I won't bore you with the reasons why.  My brain brought up a word.
"Claviash".  It's a game I recall my father playing, or my mother
talking about my father playing, or both.

So I did what I often do when confronted with a partial memory.  I 
searched the Web.  In particular, I searched the Web for ruls to
the game.

My first search was only particularly successful.  I could not find
rules.  I could not find much at all.  But I did find a line in an
Arthur Miller play.  At the beginning of scene 3 of _The Man Who Had
All The Luck_, one of the characters says "There's no brainwork in
this game.  Let me teach you claviash."  That context does suggest
it's something my father would have played.  Was my father an
Arthur Miller character?  No, probably not.  But it feels like he
inhabited a similar world to those characters, at least when he and
mom lived in NYC.

What next?  I considered other spellings.  "Clabiash" came next.
It's similar.  I'd assume that my search engine would know that,
but it never hurts to try.  This time, the search engine thought
"clabiash" looked like "clubbish", but also gave me a possible lead.
A [discussion of best card
games](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/best-card-game/) has
a comment that "I don't personally play the game, but I know some
who would vote for clabiash."  The next comment, from the same
day,is "klaberjass, I think".  Ah, the joys of spelling.

Given that name, it's easy to find.  Wikipedia has [a page on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaberjass).  I appreciate the paragraph on "History and naming".

> According to David Parlett, this "popular and widespread two-hander has so many names, mostly variations on the same one, that it is hard to know which is best for universal recognition. Klaberjass is probably closest to the original." He lists the alternative names as "Clob, Clobby, Clobiosh, Klob, Kalabrisasz, Bela, Cinq Cents, Zensa". Other sources also list "Klabberjass, Senserln, Clobyosh, Kalabrias, Klab, Clabber, Clobber, Clubby". Another common name is Klabrias. This truly international game originates from the Low Countries and is particularly strong in Jewish communities. (For an earlier form see the history of Jackâ€“Nine card games.) 

"Particularly strong in Jewish Communities".  Yup, it's almost
certainly the game dad played.  Then there are the rules.  It's a
game with 32 cards, 7-A in four suits.  It's a trick taking game,
but also one in which certain melds of cards score points.  Melding
reveals information to the other player, so there can be disadvantages
for scoring a meld.  That definitely sounds like the kind of complexity
dad would have liked.  It's also one his namesake would enjoy.  Maybe
we'll play when we're next together.

You know what's scary, at least to me?  In [my latest
manuscript](eng207-3b-manuscript) for _The Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_, I noted that 32 is the number of cards when you have
four suits and eight cards in each suit.  I wasn't thinking of any
game in particular, just about cards, family, and the number 32.
I wonder if somewhere, deep in the recesses of that thing I call a
brain, some aspect of claviash [1] resides.  Now I have to decide
whether to change that part in the next version of the manuscript [2].

**_Postscript_**.  It appears some people spell the name as
"[Bela](https://www.pagat.com/jass/bela.html)".  I don't see how
one gets the expected pronunciation of that.

[1] Given the huge range of spellings, I don't think there's any harm 
in me thinking of it as "claviash".  What's good enough for Arthur Miller
is good enough for me.

[2] That presumes there will be a next version of that manuscript.  I
have not yet decided which of the manuscripts I'm rewriting.

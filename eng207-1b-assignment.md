I turned in my first writing assignment for _The Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_ yesterday.  In case you don't know, the general framework
for assignments in that class is something like the following.

> Pick one of the model pieces that we've read in this genre or subgenre.

> Identify some techniques the writer uses in that piece and assign
  yourself to use them in your piece.

> Write a five-to-six-page manuscript.

I got to choose between the following models:

* Edward Abbey's "Havasu"
* Ehrlich
* Kincaid
* Whitehead
* Orlean
* Gonzales
* Mukhopadhyay
* Mukhopadhyay
* Mukhopadhyay
* Urea
* Mukhopadhyay
* Mukhopadhyay
* Mukhopadhyay
* Martone

Which did I choose?  I ended up debating between the pieces from
the first day of class, either the Ehrlich piece, which we discussed,
and the Edward Abbey piece, which we did not.  The Ehrlich was a
bit more lyrical and, while I did not need to replicate all that
lyricism, I ended finding more that I liked (and thought I could
replicate) in the Abbey piece.  I did want to borrow Ehrlich's use
of multiple definitions of a word, but there was more in the Abbey
that resonated.  What about the Kincaid piece?  The Kinkaid piece,
while wonderful, was also painful, and I thought I'd do myself and
Kincaid a disservice by trying to replicate that tone.

Here's the assignment I wrote for myself.  Implicit in the assignment
is "include these seven forms".

---

Based on Edward Abbey’s “Havasu”, from _Desert Solitaire_, reprinted in _Contemporary Creative Nonfiction_, The Art of Truth, Roorbach (ed.), pp. 424–428.

1. Sneak in the lyrics to a popular song by breaking them up.

   > “Barstow … San Bernardino” (p. 424)

2. Rule of three, using two identical short sentences and then expanding in the third.

   > “I went for walks.  I went for walks.  I went for walks and on one of these, the last I took in Havasu, regained everything that seemed to be ebbing away.” (p. 426)

3. Write about something indirectly, without saying explicitly what it is.

   > “where no one with tangible substance or the property of reflecting light ever entered” (p. 426) [1]

4. Reverse a trope or role.

   > “I’m not sure that I care for the idea of strangers examining my daily habits and folkways, studying my language, inspecting my costume, questioning me about my religion, classifying my artifacts, investing my sexual rites and evaluating my chances for cultural survival.”  (p. 424)

5. Use an adverb or a single word as a sentence by itself, suggesting multiple meanings.

   > “The first thing I did was take off my pants.  Naturally.”  (p. 425)

6. Violate the reader’s expectations of one of the characters.

   > “On the way we stopped off briefly to roll an old tire into the Grand Canyon” (p. 424) [2]

7. Add an appropriate, but somewhat sarcastic, parenthetical comment about something unexpected you’ve just revealed about a character.

   > “I had some matches with me, sealed in paraffin (the prudent explorer).” (p. 429)

You probably need to read the whole piece to understand the broader
context of each of those.

Now that I read it in this form, I wonder if I should have stuck
with those seven issues.  I know I left out a major aspect of the
Abbey piece, but that seems okay; folks didn't assign themselves
an object when using the Frank Conroy piece.  I really loved the
parenthetical, the "naturally", and the way he describes Native
Americans thinking about him, so it seemed unavoidable to include
them and, hence, to choose Abbey as my model.

Tomorrow, you can see what I wrote.

[1] Isn't that a great way to talk about the presence of ghosts?

[2] It turns out that this isn't as much of a violation as I
thought.  For someone who writes so eloquently about nature, Abbey
appears to be fairly casual with it.  A friend told me that Abbey
used to measure distances by the number of beer cans he tossed out
the car window.

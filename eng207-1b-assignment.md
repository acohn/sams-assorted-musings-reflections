I turned in my first writing assignment for _The Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_ yesterday.  In case you don't know, the general framework
for assignments in that class is something like the following.

> Pick one of the model pieces that we've read in this genre or subgenre.

> Identify some techniques the writer uses in that piece and assign
  yourself to use them in your piece.

> Write a five-to-six-page manuscript.

I got to choose between the following models:

* Place & Travel, Day 1
    * Edward Abbey's "Havasu", taken from _Desert Solitaire_.
    * Gretel Ehrlich's "Island".
    * Jamaica Kincaid's "A Small Place".
* Place & Travel, Day 2
    * Colin Whitehead's "The Port Authority".
    * Susan Orlean's "A Place Called Midland".
    * Laurence Gonzales' "Marion Prison".
    * Tito Mukhopadhyay's _Plankton Dreams_, Chapter 7.
    * Tito Mukhopadhyay's _Plankton Dreams_, Chapter 8 [1].
    * Tito Mukhopadhyay's _Plankton Dreams_, Chapter 9.
* Place & Travel, Day 3
    * An excerpt from Luis Alberto Urrea's _From Across the Wire_.
    * Tito Mukhopadhyay's _Plankton Dreams_, Chapter 10.
    * The epilogue to Tito Mukhopadhyay's _Plankton Dreams_ [2].
    * Ralph Savarese's afterword to _Plankton Dreams_ [3].
* Place & Travel, Day 4
    * Michael Martone's "Manufacturing Place"

Which did I choose?  I ended up debating between two model pieces
from the first day of this segment, either the Ehrlich piece, which
we discussed, and the Edward Abbey piece, which we did not.  The
Ehrlich was a bit more lyrical and, while I did not need to replicate
all that lyricism, I ended finding more that I liked (and thought
I could replicate) in the Abbey piece.  I did want to borrow Ehrlich's
use of multiple definitions of a word, but there was more in the
Abbey that resonated.  What about the Kincaid piece?  The Kincaid
piece, while wonderful, was also painful, and I thought I'd do
myself and Kincaid a disservice by trying to replicate that tone.

Here's the assignment I wrote for myself.  Implicit in the assignment
is "include these seven forms".  I tended to consider smaller aspects
of the writing, rather than broader issues.  I think those work
well as I work to improve my writing.

Based on Edward Abbey’s “Havasu”, from _Desert Solitaire_, reprinted in _Contemporary Creative Nonfiction, The Art of Truth_, Roorbach (ed.), pp. 424–428.

1. Sneak in the lyrics to a popular song by breaking them up.

   > “Barstow … San Bernardino” (p. 424)

2. Rule of three, using two identical short sentences and then expanding in the third.

   > “I went for walks.  I went for walks.  I went for walks and on one of these, the last I took in Havasu, regained everything that seemed to be ebbing away.” (p. 426)

3. Write about something indirectly, without saying explicitly what it is.

   > “where no one with tangible substance or the property of reflecting light ever entered” (p. 426) [4]

4. Reverse a trope or role.

   > “I’m not sure that I care for the idea of strangers examining my daily habits and folkways, studying my language, inspecting my costume, questioning me about my religion, classifying my artifacts, investigating [5] my sexual rites and evaluating my chances for cultural survival.”  (p. 424)

5. Use an adverb or a single word as a sentence by itself, suggesting multiple meanings.

   > “The first thing I did was take off my pants.  Naturally.”  (p. 425)

6. Violate the reader’s expectations of one of the characters.

   > “On the way we stopped off briefly to roll an old tire into the Grand Canyon” (p. 424) [6]

7. Add an appropriate, but somewhat sarcastic, parenthetical comment about something unexpected you’ve just revealed about a character.

   > “I had some matches with me, sealed in paraffin (the prudent explorer).” (p. 429)

You probably need to read the whole piece to understand the broader
context of each of those.  I'd recommend it.

Now that I read it in this form, I wonder if I should have stuck
with those seven issues.  I know I left out a major aspect of the
Abbey piece, but that seems okay; folks didn't assign themselves
an object when using the Frank Conroy piece.  I really loved the
parenthetical, the "naturally" [7], and the way he describes Native
Americans thinking about him, so it seemed unavoidable to include
them and, hence, to choose Abbey as my model.

Tomorrow, you can see what I wrote.

[1] I've listed the chapters separately because it seems we could use any
one of them as a source.

[2] The epilogue did not seem appropriate to use as the source of a
piece, but we did have to read it for day 3.

[3] Same for the afterword.

[4] Isn't that a great way to talk about the presence of ghosts?

[5] Damn!  I wrote "investing" when I turned it in.  Ah, the joy of typos.

[6] It turns out that this isn't as much of a violation as I
thought.  For someone who writes so eloquently about nature, Abbey
appears to be fairly casual with it.  A friend told me that Abbey
used to measure distances by the number of beer cans he tossed out
the car or truck window along the way.

[7] Grammarly doesn't like the "naturally" in this musing.  It probably
won't like it in my musing, either.

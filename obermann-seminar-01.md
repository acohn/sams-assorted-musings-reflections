My first Obermann seminar
=========================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), academia, [writing](index-on-writing)*

One benefit of being an Obermann Fellow is that you participate in a
bi-weekly seminar with the other Obermann Fellows.  At each seminar,
two of the Fellows present their work in progress for others to discuss.
And yes, we've read an excerpt of that work in advance of the meeting.

This past week, we had our first Obermann Seminar.  My experiences
preparing for and participating in the seminar reinforce some of my
concerns from [my first day at the Obermann Center](obermann-day-one).
In reading the first excerpt, I said to myself,

> I always say that my writing is competent, but not exceptional [1].
This paper reminds me of what good academic writing can be like.  And it
really is good writing.  The sentences are sophisticated but clear.
While it is well grounded in the literature, an outsider like me can still
understand it.  You can tell that thought went into the sentences.
Or, perhaps the author is so used to writing high-quality sentences that
they come naturally.  I'm not sure that I can ever write this well [2].

It's not that I write poorly.  I'm arrogant enough to say that my writing
is not only generally clear, but also above the average for the papers
I read in my discipline.  I can't recall the last time I've looked at a
paper in computer science and found myself noticing the quality of the
writing [3].  But this paper made me remember what really good academic
writing can look like [4].  Now I want to read that Fellow's books [5].

The other Fellow's work was in rougher shape; they'd warned us
that it was an early draft.  However, as in the first work, I appreciated
the clear grounding in theory and the way ideas stem from the kinds of
close reading that humanists do.  I find my work meaningful, but it's
much more grounded in motivation and in practice than in theory.

What do I mean that it's grounded in motivation?  Much of my work is
in the field of CS education. As a computer science educator, I want
to find ways to teach my students better.  And, as a computer science
educator, I have the moral responsibility to identify, explore, and
embrace approaches to teaching that will help diversify our discipline.
That is, I'm motivated by the problems at hand: helping students learn
better and broadening participation.

I'm also an experimentalist at heart.  While many of the approaches I take
are grounded in prior work [6], I also like to explore new strategies.
The digital humanities approach to introductory CS that I'm working on
this semester stems from my desire to find new ways to bring people with
different perspectives into the discipline [7].

My, that was a bit of a detour.  Where was I?  That's right.  I was
finding myself impressed by the broad array of theoretical works my
colleagues draw about and reflecting on the role of theory in my work.
It's not that I don't have deeper theory to draw upon.  There's certainly
a wealth of work on the value of active learning.  And, whether I cite
it or not, I subscribe to Vygotsky's zone of proximal development [8].
But I'm not sure that either grounds my work in quite the same way that
theory seems to ground humanists.  Is that a flaw?  No, it strikes me
that it's more of a disciplinary difference.

While both works were in domains quite different than those I regularly
study and, as I suggested, are very different than the kind of work I do,
I did my best to reflect on what I could contribute to the discussion.
I noted some sections that I, as a non-specialist, found less clear.
I noted some places where the writing sounded like mine [9].  Then we
got to the seminar itself.

While I was not over my head in the seminar, I did realize that my
contributions were likely to be much shallower than my colleagues'.
Many drew on much closer readings of the excerpts than I could provide.
I was also surprised at the number of comments that drew on outside
sources: Did you consider *this related issue* or *this theorist*
in addressing this topic?  Those aren't the kinds of comments I can
contribute.  I did have some suggestions that I think were helpful,
but I'm not sure they reached the level of quality of my peers' comments.

I was also struck by just how damn smart these people are. There's a
real joy in hearing deep thinkers reflect on a topic and on writing.
I particularly appreciated the ways in which Teresa Magnum, the Center's
director, steered our conversations and the careful and thoughtful
comments she had on each work.   I consider myself particularly fortunate
to be able to work with her this semester [10].

I've signed up to present at the seminar in about four weeks.  I find
myself wondering, in part, what it will be like to have my kind of
work before this august group of thinkers.  I won't be presenting a
traditional sort of scholarly work; I'm working on curriculum, not
a book [11].  I won't show
the same level of writing.  At the same time, one of the goals of the
new course is to provide inroads to computing for people who would not
necessarily consider studying computing.  So it will be worthwhile to
share my introduction.  I had considered sharing the schedule of topics.
However, I don't expect that it will be meaningful to this group.
Perhaps I'll instead share selections of the first reading on markup
and the corresponding assignment.  I'll make those decisions closer to
the date.

[1] I have traditionally said that my writing is "workmanlike".  But
Grammarly tells me that some of my audience may object to that term.

[2] Let me put on my growth-mindset hat for a moment.  If I spent the
necessary effort on my writing, I definitely could come close to writing
that well.  So perhaps it's more that I'd rather spend my time working
on other things.

[3] That *positive* quality.  I do sometimes read papers, particularly
while reviewing, and wonder at the infelicities.

[4] The Fellow noted that the work we saw was still a draft.  I wonder
what their polished work looks like?

[5] It helps that the Fellow's most recent book appears to be on a kind
of subject that I enjoy reading about.

[6] For example, we've used a Media Computation approach in CSC 151
because of the work of Guzdial, Erickson, and others in showing that
such an approach better supports women.  Similarly, I look for ways
to include issues of Computing for Social Good because of the work of
Goldweber and others.  More broadly, I know the power of active learning
approaches in supporting members of underrepresented groups.

[7] If I were a better experimentalist, I'd have more precise ways to 
measure that effect.

[8] I'm not sure that it's at the front of my mind when I design an
exercise or assignment, but it's there nonetheless.

[9] That is, not up to their standards.

[10] I also consider myself fortunate to work with all of the Obermann
Fellows.

[11] Well, my curriculum may end up as a textbook.  That's a separate
issue.

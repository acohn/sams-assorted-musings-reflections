"Why are you doing this?"
=========================

Earlier this month, a colleague at another institution mentioned that
they were reading a few of my essays, and then followed up with an
interesting question: *Why are you doing this, and how long have you
done this and how long do you hope to keep it up for?* [1]

Why?  A variety of reasons.  It started, in part, because I found I
had a lot of writing I was doing that might be more broadly useful.
For example, once I've written to one student what kind of computer
they should buy, it's not clear that I need to write a different email
message to the next student [2].   I started, in part, because I rant a lot,
and I found it useful to put my rants in essay form before converting
them to email messages.  I started, in part, as a form of therapy.
I'm suffering from some significant burnout, and doing these essays
seemed to be a way for me to do something I enjoy (that is, writing)
without necessarily having goals [3].  
Many articles serve little purpose other than to give me an excuse to
write and think about something.

[Encourage me to prepare; e.g. talks and speeches.]

The profiles that I'm writing this month serve another purpose: They 
remind me of how fortunate I am to do what I do.  I work with and teach
some really amazing people.  Writing about them makes me feel happier.
I think it also makes others feel happier (and not just the subjects
of the articles).

How long have I done this? I started in the spring, stopped for the
summer, and then restarted in the fall.  I'm up to about 120 essays
(40 before summer, 80 since) [4].  Breaking 100 gives me a sense of
accomplishment.  

How long do I hope to keep it up for?  At this point, I intend to keep
going indefinitely.  I have a list of about 100 additional topics to
write about, and I expect that I will continue to come up with new topics.
I certainly have a wide variety of Grinnell folks who are not yet on my
list and are worth writing about.  At some point, I'll probably also 
revisit past topics.

[Having an audience, particularly an audience that I discover 
unexpectedly, is exiting.]

[1] Okay, that's three questions.  But they called it "a question".

[2] Similarly, once I've written to one person about why I'm writing
these essays, it's not clear that I need to write a different message
to the next person; I can just point them to this essay.

[3] Okay, I sometimes have the goals I just mentioned; but I'm also free 
to write something stupid or silly if that's what I decide I need
to do

[4] Those numbers were the case when I wrote back to the person.
I'm now up to about 140 essays, 100 since summer.

The Facebook book challenge
===========================

*Topics/tags: ???*

There's a challenge going around Facebook that asks people to post
the covers of seven books that are meaningful to them.  Here's the
template of the challenge:

>  Day N: I accepted the challenge from PERSON to post seven books I love, one book per day, no exceptions, no reviews, just covers. Each day I will ask a friend to take up the challenge. Let's promote literacy and a book list. Today I challenge PERSON.

At times I feel like the Chidi character on _The Good Place_: Making choices
is hard. How do I pick seven books?  How do I pick seven *people*?  Oh well,
I'm just going to trust my intuition each day.  I apologize to the books
and people I missed.  If you haven't been challenged yet, feel free to
take this musing as a challenge.

Here are the books I chose.  Since the challenge says not to give a rationale
(or implies that we should not give a rationale), I'm not going to do so
here.  I've written about many of these before.  I may write about the rest
later.

* _Style, Toward Clarity and Grace_ 
* _Stranded_
* _Visual Modeling with Logo_
* _The Princess Bride_
* _The Best of All Possible Worlds_

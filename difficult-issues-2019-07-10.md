Difficult issues

*Topics/tags: [Language](index-language), academia, rambly*

_Warning: Because I discuss offensive language in this musing, it includes some such language.  I have done my best to limit that use._

Another week.  Another [_Inside Higher Ed_ report on an idiot student
using the n-word](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/07/09/calls-expulsion-texas-am-student-who-used-racial-slurs-viral-video).  I'm not
quite sure what to make of these videos, other than to find frustration
at the number of people who feel compelled to use the word.  What
underlies that hatred?  I can't imagine what it must be like to know
that people feel so comfortable using that word about you (or people
who look like you).

But the report also got me thinking about an earlier case, one in which
a student read the word aloud in discussing a James Baldwin essay,
and a faculty member asked the class to discuss whether or not it
was appropriate to use the word in that context.  [The faculty member was
suspended](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/02/01/professor-suspended-using-n-word-class-discussion-language-james-baldwin-essay),
which, at the time, struck me as a clear violation of academic freedom.  As I reflected on
the videos, I realized that it's not quite as straightforward as I once
thought.  I do think that the use of the word in discussions of literature
requires different consideration than use in other situations [1], but
I acknowledge that even discussing whether or not to use it can be hard
on those affected by the word.  Nonetheless, suspension seems extreme [2].

Recalling that case made me wonder what the
ultimate outcome had been.  Had the faculty member
regained his position?  I found an answer in [_The Minneapolis
Star-Tribune_](http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-professor-s-suspension-fuels-academic-freedom-debate/507888931/).
He will resume teaching in the fall, but he has lost his directorship
of the Honors program.

I recalled that the faculty member had asked his students
to read [an article by Ta-Nehesi Coates on the use of the
word](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/opinion/sunday/coates-in-defense-of-a-loaded-word.html).
The work was thoughtful, as is most of what I've read by Coates. I
appreciated his argument that there are a wide variety of words that can
be used by one group, but not another, even something as simple as who
can appropriately call someone by their nickname.  Still, I consider the
classroom a special context, especially when you're reading a work in
which the author has used a term intentionally.  Coates' piece doesn't
address that issue [3].

I also found parts of Coates' essay upsetting.  In particular,
he writes,

> A few summers ago one of my best friends invited me up to what he affectionately called his "white-trash cabin" in the Adirondacks. This was not how I described the outing to my family. Two of my Jewish acquaintances once joked that Iâ€™d "make a good Jew." My retort was not, "Yeah, I certainly am good with money." Gay men sometimes laughingly refer to one another as "faggots." 

I don't know about you, but I find one of those cases significantly
different than the others.  Claiming a derogatory term for yourself is
one thing.  Associating a particular characteristic with certain people
is another thing altogether.  And the association of Jews with money is
one of those biases that underlie anti-semitism.  It would seem more
appropriate if reflected on the k-word.  Of course, I've never heard
a Jew use that word, so the example doesn't fit his argument.
I'm also puzzled about his association; I don't know about you, but if
I said someone would "make a good Jew", I would most likely mean that
they enjoy debate and argument and even appreciate what some might call
exacting details [4].

Where does that leave us?  I have no idea.  As I said [5], these are
difficult issues.  But it frustrates me that both thoughtless and
thoughtful people can have attitudes and use language that have 
such potential to harm others.

Postscript: As I reread the paragraph from Coates, I find that "white-trash
cabin" also fails to fit Coates' thesis.  I'm pretty sure that a friend
who lives in NYC and has a cabin in the Adirondacks does not fall into
the category that most call "white trash".

[1] I'm glad that I don't teach literature that uses the word so that
I can easily say "Don't use the word in my classes."

[2] As I think he should.  Everything I've read indicates that his
suggestion that they class discuss whether or not to use the word came
from an appropriate concern for inclusiveness.

[3] Nor was that part of its intent.

[4] Those seem to be the characteristics that lead folks to assume that
one of my colleagues is Jewish.

[5] Or at least as I named this musing.

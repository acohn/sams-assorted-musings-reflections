I have a lot of cool friends. I get reminded of that recently when
I see or hear about their accomplishments, their activities, their
events.  This friend received an award for mentoring women.  This
friend hosted what sounds like an incredible house concert.  This
friend taught a MOOC to tens of thousands of people.  This friend
made a real difference to someone.

I will admit that I am a bit broad in my definition of "friend". I
count a number of Grinnell colleagues and CS colleagues from other
institutions as friends, even if we wouldn't necessarily, say,
invite each other to our weddings [1].  I also count many alumni
as friends; I hope they think of themselves as my friends.

I was reminded of the joys of knowing cool people the other day when
the legendary Rachel Rose '01 posted a link to [an article on
the use of LucasFilm "Stagecraft" technology in _The Mandalorian_].
For those who don't know Rachel, I'll just note that she's been at
LucasFilm ever since finishing her Ph.D. in Computer Graphics at
the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and is one of the CG supervisors
on _The Mandalorian_.  I don't hear enough about the particulars of
Rachel's work (or maybe I don't ask enough), but I'm pretty sure that
she was closely involved in the Stagecraft technology, which the
articlesimplifies as something that "uses a rear-projected LED
screen to create a reactive environment that essentially works as
an immersive real-time green screen."

I already think the work I hear about is cool.  But what really struck
me when I saw the post is the kind of comments she got on the post. People
were not only commenting on her work on the project, but also asking
about thetechnology, such as "Was this an extension of the tech they 
were working on down on the mocap stage?"  How many people work at a
place that has a motion capture stage [3], let alone have an impact on
related technologies.

I should try to convince Justin to bring her back for his [Digital
Media Design for Performance](http://thd295.thomas.sites.grinnell.edu/)
class [5].  I should also keep Rachel in mind the next time there's a
call for honorary degree recipients.  Her work is artistic and I'm
pretty sure that she was a dual CS/English major; perhaps we can give
her an honorary doctorate in humane letters.  And I should certainly
write a more complete musings about Rachel.  I see that I have some
notes for such a musing that I started more than three years ago [6].
Stay tuned.

[1] No, I have no plans for another wedding.  Michelle and I have
completed thirty-three years of happy marriage and just celebrated
the thirty-fifth anniversary of our first engagement [2].

[2] That's a story for another day.

[3] At least two Grinnell alums :-) [4].

[4] Are smiley faces appropriate in musings?

[5] I should also find out how you make subsites of your 
username.sites.grinnell.edu sites.

[6] Whoops.

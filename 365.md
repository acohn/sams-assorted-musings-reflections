Three-hundred and sixty-five musings
====================================

_Sam, you're almost at three-hundred and sixty-five musings.  Do you
plan to do something special for your one-year anniversary?_

Yes.

_What?_

I'm not sure sure yet.

_But isn't this your one-year anniversary?_

I'm going for one year of nearly-continuous daily musings.  Since
I didn't muse in summer 2016, the year starts from September 1, 2016
and will complete on August 31, 2017.  Plan for a musing then.

_Wow, that's a let down._

Sorry.  At least you'll get some more musings in the mean time.

_Aren't you worried that you will be incredibly busy on August 31?_

Yes.

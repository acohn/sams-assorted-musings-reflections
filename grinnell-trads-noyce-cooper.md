Grinnell traditions I despise: The Noyce/Cooper Cookout
=======================================================

Grinnell, like most small colleges, reveres its past.  It seems
like you can't go anywhere without hearing about the "Iowa Band"
[1] or seeing a remnant of them.  We name our buildings and places 
after beloved and influential alumni or members of the campus: [Robert
Noyce '49](robert-noyce), co-inventor of the integrated circuit and
co-founder of Intel; [Hallie Flanagan 1911](hallie-flanagan), American
theatre pioneer; [Harry Hopkins 1912](harry-hopkins), architect of the New
Deal; [Joe Rosenfield '25](joe-rosenfield), Boy Scouting legend; and more.

As you might expect, Grinnell students develop traditions that relate
to these alums.  For example, they hold an annual Mary B. James dance
to honor the many high-school dances and other social events in our
community that James chaperoned or arranged.

Two of the stranger and more troublesome traditions at Grinnell stem from
activities of some successful, but irresponsible, alumni.  Every biography
of Robert N. Noyce '49 mentions the legendary pig roast, in which he
stole a pig from a local farmer.  In his speech at the dedication of
the Noyce Science Center, [Grant Gale](grant-gale) spoke of his efforts
to make sure that Noyce was not expelled.  And, of course, [Gary Cooper
'26](gary-cooper) made the regrettable decision to walk a stolen horse
to the top of Gates tower [4].  Cooper did not have his own Grant Gale.
He was expelled.  As I understand it, his expulsion [5] led him to seek
his fortune "out west" and to his successful career.

To celebrate these historical events, each year students hold the 
"Noyce/Cooper cookout".  In this tradition, they slaughter and
roast a pig and walk a cow [6] to the top of Gates Tower, which they
then slaughter and cook.  I guess their comfort in doing so stems from
being in a farming state.  Note that they do not steal the pig or the
cow; rather, they purchase them from local farmers, thereby benefitting
the local economy.  To enhance the celebration, they combine the two
activities in one weekend.

I must admit that I find these traditions troublesome and inappropriate.
I do appreciate the benefit that these events bring to the local economy,
particularly because we purchase multiple pigs and cows to feed the
large number of participants [7].  It's also nice to have a tradition
that does not involve alcohol.  I like that it brings together most
of the campus community, that we include any interested folks from the
broader community, and that many alums return [8].  I've heard
that our studio art students faculty make use of the bones in some
incredibly compelling projects.  

Nonetheless, it seems unnecessarily cruel to slaughter these animals
on campus.  The pig roast is also troublesome given the population of
Jewish and Muslim students on campus.  Plus, I expect that our custodial
staff have to spend a lot of time and effort cleaning up the blood.
The event may also explain why we have so few vegetarians who choose to
attend Grinnell.

If you're interested in participating, you are welcome to attend.  Like
most events on campus, the Noyce/Cooper cookout is free and open to all
comers.  Unfortunately, you'll have to wait another year, since the
event happens on April 1 [19].

Let's see ... I should be a bit clearer.  There is no Noyce/Cooper picnic.
No, students do not slaughter pigs or cows or horses.  We have large
numbers of vegetarian and vegan students on campus [22].  Robert N. Noyce
'49 *did* steal a pig from a local farmer for a hog roast and needed Grant
Gale's rhetorical chops to avoid expulsion.  While we don't have a the
Noyce/Cooper picnic a few years ago, the Trustees did create an event
called "Selah" which included a hog roast that was supposed to harken
back to the Noyce "incident" [24].  Gary Cooper '26 almost certainly
did not ride a horse to the top of Gates tower [25].  While Cooper
never graduated from Grinnell, he left voluntarily rather than being
expelled.  Students do have a Mary B. James festival.  Because James'
name can be heard as "Mary *Be* James", the Mary B. James party is a 
cross-dressing festival.  Fig Newtons *are* named after Newton,
Massachusetts.  Our country *is* currently experiencing a significant
disconnect between fact and fiction.  Grinnell was founded by something we
refer to as "The Iowa Band", but you see little evidence of it on campus.
Lee Running in art does some amazing work with bones, but she uses deer
bones she collects as a way to reflect on the inadvertent slaughter
of deer that our highways create.  I have heard that Dayton Meat has
excellent bacon.  Bruce Springsteen did play in the old Darby [26].
Many of the endnotes in this essay lack a corresponding referent.
These endnotes exist primarily so that there is a gap between the first
set of endnotes and the "surprise statement" [27].  I do wonder what a
marching band with a hundred and ten cornettos would sound like [28,29].
Newton North is superior to Newton South.  You should enjoy the article
that I mention in the next paragraph.  That should cover most of
the claims I made in this musing.

_The Grinnell Magazine_ recently ran [a relatively nice article about
Grinnell myths and legends](https://www.grinnell.edu/news/campus-myth-busters).
You might want to check it out.

[1] No, not the seventy-six trombones kind [2].  The band of eleven
Congregationalists [3] who founded Iowa College, which was eventually
renamed to Grinnell College.

[2] I wonder what it would be like if there were a hundred and ten
cornettos close at hand.

[3] Is eleven Congregationalists a "Congregational dozen"?

[4] In case you didn't know, horses will walk up stairs, but not back down.

[5] Given that he never graduated, I'm not sure why we classify Cooper
as class of 1926.  My own *alma mater*, The University of Chicago, uses
a degree of X for non-graduates.  For example, Edward Asner is X'48.

[6] Horse meat is not particularly popular in Iowa.

[7] One of the farmers who supplies the meat tells me that the tradition
has helped him get by in tough years.

[8] I always like seeing alums!

[9] I suppose it would also be possible to contract with the Dayton Meat
locker [10] to further support the event.

[10] I am told that Dayton Meat has some of the best bacon around.

[11] According to a [not very useful Web
page](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/history/gary-cooper-revisits-grinnell),
Cooper returned to Grinnell after dedicating an airport in Newton [12].

[12] Newton, Iowa, not Newton, Massachusetts [14].

[14] Did you know that the Fig Newton is named after Newton, Mass [15]?

[15] If you meet someone from Newton, you should ask them "North or South?"
No, you are not asking if they are a Yankee; they are.  You are asking whether
they attended Newton North (awesome) or Newton South (pretentious) high.

[16] The stories note that "Cooper rode his horse to the top of the dorm".
Given that Cooper was described as "poor", it is unlikely that he owned
his own horse.

[17] I do not believe that Gary Cooper '26 is related to Craig Cooper, the
proprietor of [Bikes To You](http://www.bikestoyou.com/).  However, it would
not surprise me to hear that a student brought a campus bike to the top of
Gates Tower and threw it off.

[18] April fools [19]!

[19] Note that in portions of the US [20], April 1 is "April Fools Day", a day
on which people pull stupid pranks or try to convince others of 
"facts" that do not exist [21].

[20] And, perhaps, elsewhere in the world.

[21] Hmmm ... we may have reached the point every day is now April Fools Day 
in the US.

[22] We even have a vegan bar in the cafeteria [23].

[23] They do not serve roast vegan.

[24] Do I find it ironic that they served pork at an event named using a Hebrew
word?  Words can't begin to describe how I felt.

[25] He also did not ride a horse to the top of another building on campus.

[26] No, I made no claims about Bruce Springsteen elsewhere in this article.
It just seemed useful to add.

[27] It probably wasn't much of a surpise, but I tried my best.

[28] In that case, seventy six sackbuts should lead the big parade.

[29] They could also play "Zink went the strings of my heart."

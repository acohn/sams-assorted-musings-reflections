Vegetarian in Iowa
==================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), Iowa, short*

Although I'm an omnivore [1], I have many friends who are vegetarian or
pescatarian.  And I'm always amazed at what obstacles they put up with
while in Iowa.

When I was first in Iowa, I recall going out with some friends and
them asking whether the corn chowder was vegetarian.  The answer
was "Yes".  But when the soup [2] came, it appeared to have bits of
bacon.  My friend asked about that and the response was, "Oh, that's
just a spice."

Today I had a similar experience.  A friend and I were eating at a
"back of the drug store" countertop.  I thought he was going to order
a tuna-fish sandwich.  But he said, "I want the vegetable cheeseburger."
Given the name, I was suspicious.  He pointed to the menu, which read,

> Quarter pound vegetable patty on a buttered, grilled bun.

I got even more suspicious when the waitress/cook put the burgers
on the grill.  His looked indistinguishable from mine.  So I asked,
"Is that a vegetable burger?"  And I thought she said "Yes".

Then she served the burger.  And, as you'd expect, it was a beef hamburger
[3].  Guess what?  "Vegetable burger", in their parlance, means "burger
with vegetables".  She even reaffirmed that.  "Yup, it's a burger with
vegetables."  We showed her the menu.  She said, "A high-school student
wrote that; they didn't get it right."  I'm not sure why they leave it
on the menu if it's wrong.  I'm also not sure why the vegetable burger
is $5.99 when a regular hamburger is about $3.79 and adding all the
vegetables only costs forty-nine cents.

At least she was willing to make him a grilled-cheese sandwich instead
[4].

[1] Well, I won't eat *everything*, but I eat a wide variety of substances,
including meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, and grains.

[2] chowder.

[3] That may not be surprising.  It's also probably good; they cooked
both hamburgers with bacon next to them.

[4] They were out of tuna fish.

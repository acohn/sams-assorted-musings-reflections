Another month of daily musings
==============================

*Topics/tags: [On musing](index-on-writing), long*

It's the end of another month of daily musings [1].  At the end of each
month, I like to reflect on what I've mused about in the past month and
what I've gained [2] or learned from doing those musings.  When I first
started musing, I noticed effects on my writing.  These days, I notice
fewer effects on my writing, but perhaps more effects on how I decide
to arrange my writing.

I ended last month 310 musings ahead of last year.  For some reason,
Facebook isn't giving me the friendly "a year ago, you posted ..."
messages that it usually does [3].  So I'll need to look.  On May 1, 2017, I
posted Musing #306 on [Hotel Grinnell](hotel-grinnell).  This musing will
be musing #617.  It appears that I am now 311 musings ahead of last year.
Why is that?  I think there was one day in which I posted two musings.

Beyond that, let's see what's happened this month.

---

I made some broad changes to the musings.  Among other things, I've
started adding a list of topics and tags at the top.  I can't quite
remember why I started doing that.  I had intended to muse about adding
tags, but never got around to it.  My best recollection is that I wanted
to think a bit more broadly about the subjects and forms of the musings.
For example, the ones that I intend to be short are marked "short".
Links to topical collections also highlight those topical collections
[4], such as the [collection of rants](index-rants).

After attending a talk on [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is), I decided
to add Hypothes.is annotation capabilities to the musings.  I have not
yet figured out how to track whether anyone annotates the musings, so
I count on my annotators to email me [5].

I had planned to write a new introduction, particularly when I
reached my [600th musing](elaine-marzluff) or [my second anniversary of
musing](second-anniversary).  However, although I started sketching the
introduction about a month ago, I still haven't found time to finish it.
Parts of it did get put into the anniversary musing, which potentially
complicates matters.  I'm also not quite sure what I want to say, and
it's something that I want to get right.

---

I found myself experimenting a bit with process.  There was a week in
which I tried to plan what I would muse about for the next week [7].
But those plans quickly got disrupted.  In some cases, it's because I
did not have as much time as I anticipated and found myself wanting to
muse quickly.  In others, I needed external approval for a musing.
For example, I don't generally post musings about living non-public
figures without getting their permission [8].

Speaking of needing to muse quickly, there were a number of nights in 
which I planned to muse quickly.  But that didn't always happen.
I'm not sure which musings they were any more, but I recall more than
a few nights in which I sat down to write something short and ended
up not only writing something long, but spending a lot of time looking
up additional information as I wrote something wrong.

However, when lack of sleep caught up to me at the end of the month,
I did manage a series of three short musings, one on [lack of
sleep](sleepless-cycles), one on [my lack of accomplishment due to
sleeplessness](unproductive-2018-04-29), and one on [my failure to
realize it was the end of the month](whoops-2018-04-30).

I often ponder whether I should try to post the musings earlier in
the evening.  Currently, I post most of them around 10 p.m. central
time, which is when I tend to finish them.  But I'd need to start them
earlier to post them earlier and there's usually something else that
has higher priority or that requires more mental focus.  For example,
this evening I had to write three exam problems.

There were a few that got posted earlier, in part because
I felt a particularly strong need to write them.  The one I
most recall is the one on children's toys that I called [mixed
messages](mixed-messages-2018-04-11), which appeared at 7 p.m. or
so.  There may be others; I don't generally keep track of a precise
time of posting.  My RSS feed suggests that the post on [expanding
the faculty](expanding-the-faculty) and the [followup comments on
recycling](recycling-revisited-2018-04-17) were both posted relatively
early in the evening.

---

Are there themes to the content?  Let's see ...

I recall ending a prior month reflecting on whether I should
be nicer.  But I ranted a reasonable amount this month, whether
it was about [children's toys](mixed-messages-2018-04-11),
[faculty meetings](criticizing-faculty-proposals),
[recycling](recycling-2018-04-12), and [code that makes me
ill](bad-code-2018-04-14).

At the same time, there were a few musings in which I had to
apologize for, or at least provide an update on, prior rants.
Once ITS replaced the defective hardware in my classroom, I posted
what I consider [an appropriate followup](better-classroom-software).
And after some frustration at seeing a misleading announcement about
[recycling](recycling-2018-04-12), I posted [a hopeful followup
musing](recycling-revisited-2018-04-17) [9].

When I reached 600 musings, I chose to restart the important but
difficult to write series [Grinnellians you should know (or know
about)](index-grinnellians).  I must admit that those are some of my
favorite musings.  They make me feel good.  I think they make other people
feel good.  They shouldn't make anyone feel bad.  That's definitely
a net positive.  But they are hard to write and take a lot of thought
and attention that seem to be in short supply.  I have a few more in the
"soon" queue, but more than two weeks have passed and I haven't been
able to write any yet.

---

Musing always has some effect on me.  As I say too often, I write
primarily for myself.  I find it relieving to get a rant down in
writing.  I enjoy the sense of having mused.  And, at times, I learn
a lot.  For example, writing the long rant on [Getting requirements
wrong](getting-requirements-wrong) ended up being a useful exercise.
I explained to myself why I care about these issues.  In doing the
background research for the musing [10], I learned that we've explicitly
exempted some majors from the department limit.  I began to think
about the issue for Math/Stats.  However, learning comes at a price.
When I started writing this musing, I planned for it to be a short rant.
Instead, it ended up being twice the "normal" musing length [11].

At some point this month, I had to give an extemporaneous
speech on the value of CSC 321 and CSC 322, the two primary
courses in our software-design curriculum.  Since I've written
about [the two courses](csc321-and-csc322), some [aspects
of course design](csc322-rhythm), and even [an important
assignment](csc322-ethics-assignment), I am under the impression
that doing the writing allowed me to speak more articulately about the
courses.  But I do speak about those courses a moderate amount.  So
maybe it's just general practice.

And it's not like I remember everything I write.  I'm finding more and
more frequently that I start to muse about a topic only to realize that
I'd already written something.  For example, after yet another discussion
in which people disparaged double majors, I sketched a paragraph about
them that was to serve as the start of a musing.  A few days later, I
realized that [I had already mused about the subject](double-majors).
But I change and grow.  So I have new things to say (e.g., that
eight-course majors make double majors much easier). Nonetheless, I
think I'll put it off a bit longer.  And, in the long run, I do think
it will be valuable to return to topics I've mused about in the past.

---

I ended [last month's end-of-month musing](another-month-2018-03) with
a summary of outstanding musings, or at least of the numbers of 
outstanding musing topics.  For my own purposes, I think it will be
useful to update that summary.  The "categories" are still not very
sensible; I can't recall where I mused about the reasons for the names.
At some point, I will rearrange the list of forthcoming musings [14,15].

I've added a new category, which I call "for specific dates".  There are
a few dates that seem to call for special musings, and it seemed like
I would miss those dates unless I set them apart [16].    I've also added
a section called "delayed" rants.  I had written those down in a place
that I had stopped checking, and so they weren't on my list of forthcoming
musings.  I've renamed "next set" to "high priority".  I'm not sure why.

    Category                     Last Month      This Month      Change
    --------                     ----------      ----------      ------

    topics to revisit               12              12             

More than a year's worth of musing topics, including twenty or so
new topics.  If I keep going in that direction, I'll never write about
everything I've planned.  If I keep adding new topics to the top of
the stack, I'll rarely think about the old ones.  Yeah, I do need to
rearrange the topics.  Tagging may help.  But reorganization will wait
until many other tasks get done.

I've gone on a bit long, as is typical for these end-of-month musings.
Once again, I found it fulfilling to reflect a bit and useful to gather
some meaningless data.  I hope you found something in this musing that
you enjoyed.

I wonder what I'll muse about and discover through musing this month.
We shall see.

---

[1] More accurately, it's the start of the next month.  It appears
that [I was a day off when I planned this musing](whoops-2018-04-30)

[2] Or, in some cases, lost.

[3] I wonder if that's a side effect of the whole Facebook (lack of)
privacy fiasco.

[4] I did decide that each musing belongs in at most one topical collection.

[5] I suppose that I could check back every few days to see which ones
have annotations, but that would be time-consuming.  I'm tempted to write
a script [6].

[6] I don't currently have time to write a script.  I'll do that in the 
summer.

[7] There are also times I plan less formally about what I'll do the next
few days.  Of course, that's one of the reasons this musing is a day late;
I got the plan wrong.

[8] I don't feel like I need permission to post about public figures, like 
the Dean or some alumni.

[9] Unfortunately, it appears that the hope may be premature.  The
_Grinnell Herald Register_ has reported that because of the costs, the
city of Grinnell may be discontinuing curbside recycling.  I'm not sure
what the effect will be on the College.  Last Friday's _Scarlet and Black_
has a more optimistic story, but I don't know whether the work on that
story preceded the city meeting that the _Herald Register_ reported on.

[10] Yes, I do background research for some musings.  Not a lot, and not
for every musing, but for some.  Unfortunately, research often sends me
down a rabbit hole, which is inconvenient when I have limited time.

[11] What I consider a "normal" musing is about 1000 words.  A typical
"short" musing is about half that.  A typical "long" musing is about
twice a normal musing.  A few musings reach 3000 or more words.  A few
have under a hundred.

[12] You probably notice this tendency, too.  The scary part is that I
do try to catch some of them.

[14] And possibly even add prospective tags.

[15] When I do rearrange the musings, I'll muse about it.

[16] No, I won't tell you what those are.

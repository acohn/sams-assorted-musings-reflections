Mood swings

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

Today's been a weird day.  There was a period of time today that I
said to myself "That's the last straw; I'm fed up with Grinnell".
But there were also times that I felt a bit better, perhaps even
much better.

The day started well.  I slept in a bit [1].  I planned a musing.
I went to water aerobics.  I managed to strike up a conversation
with someone I didn't know, which is hard for me.  I got some time
in the hot tub.  When I reached campus, there was chili with cinnamon
rolls.  I got a thank-you note for chocolates I'd given to someone.
All in all, a good start of the day.

Then things rapidly went downhill.

First, as I was looking for some information about Kate Walker [2],
I found [a press release from when we hired her](http://magazine.grinnell.edu/news/releases/kate-walker-named-vice-president-finance-and-treasurer-grinnell-college).  That press release indicated that

> Grinnell has become one of the nation's premier liberal arts colleges, enrolling 1,600 students [...].

That number seemed low to me compared to current enrollments, so I went to
check.  Our current [Grinnell at a Glance page](https://www.grinnell.edu/about-grinnell/grinnell-glance) says that

> About 1,700 students attend the College. 

Since Kate started in Fall 2013, that would represent a growth of about
100 students in five or so years.  Since President Kington and the
Trustees have been unwilling to allow the faculty to Grow, I was
all set to write a rant about the issue.

But that wasn't the low point.

During today's department meeting, I learned that students have
been signing in for CS Table and then not attending.  Some went so
far as to forge the names of alums or to put in humorous names,
like "Tony Stark".  I guess it may feel like a victimless crime to
the students, but we regularly over-spend our CS Table budget and
have to use our restricted fund.  I'm the second-largest donor to
that fund, and I would much rather the funds get used for other
purposes then feeding random students [3].  It also bothers me
because it's dishonest and a violation of self-governance.  It
doesn't help that I also recently learned that someone had stolen
much of the flintwork that John Whittaker had put out for sale
as a fundraiser for Anthropology.  

Surprisingly, there was a positive aspect to the CS Table discussion.
One of my colleagues raised the issue of students who are food
insecure, and we spent some time talking about how the institution
can and should support such students [4].

But the CS Table thing feels like a betrayal.  The department spends
time and effort to arrange CS Table because we believe it provides
an important educational benefit to our students.  To help our
limited funding for CS Table go further, the CS faculty pay for our
own lunches rather than charge them to the department.  To have
students charge us, not attend, and treat it like a joke, hurts.
It makes me want to stop spending the time and effort doing things
like this for students [5].

After the department meeting, I wandered over to the Registrar's
office to talk about [my innovation fund
proposal](innovation-fund-2019-09-27) to have students write more
substantive declarations of majors and defend those declarations
and their four-year plans.  While I did not receive funding under
the Pilot Project model, the Committee did suggest that I do a
Planning Project and I thought it would be good to talk to the
Registrar about some of the ideas.  

When I was there, I learned that Curriculum Committee is discussing
doing away with the major declaration essay, the essay that I was
making core to my project.  Even if we ignore my project, I think
of the major declaration essay as one of the primary times we ask
students to reflect closely on their liberal education, and it
strikes me that we are abandoning core values if we get rid of it.

All of that put me in a horrendous mood.  Then I went home and
managed to slip on the ice.  It wasn't a minor slip, either.  I
ended up on my back.  At least I didn't break anything.  Nonetheless,
adding bodily pain to mental anguish is not a step forward.

After that, I had lunch with Michelle and Youngest Son and we chatted
about a variety of things, and I felt a bit better.  Then I came
home and, in a better frame of mind, reflected on the things that
I thought had ruined my day.

I know that the enrollment numbers that appear in the College's press
releases aren't always accurate or consistent.  There are a lot of ways
to measure enrollment; for example, how do you count students studying
abroad?  So I went online and checked the data through IPEDS, the
Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.  I found that our
full-time equivalent fall enrollment in 2018 was 1,694, or "about 1,700
students".  In contrast, our full-time equivalent fall enrollment in 2012
was 1,638, which is a bit more than 1,600 students.  It's not a growth of
100 students, but it is a growth of about 56 students.  Since we have
about a 9:1 student-to-faculty ratio, that increase would suggest
hiring another six faculty members.  However, I also know that the numbers
fluctuate.  I'm sure that there's a sensible way to get time-series data
from IPEDS, but I could not figure it out, and Carlie wasn't available.
So I looked up the data for Fall 2008, the first semester after Noyce
3rd was completed.  Back then, our full-time equivalent fall
enrollment was 1,659 students.  And I'm pretty sure that the College
has added tenure-line positions since then.  So perhaps things aren't
as bad in this area as I'd thought [6].

I've made an appointment to talk to the Associate Dean who chairs
Curriculum Committee.  Tim's thoughtful and someone I respect.  I'm
hopeful that we'll have a good conversation.

What about the CS Table issues?  I don't have an answer for that.
The department is going to have to find a new process for CS Table.
I think we should involve our SEPC, since it feels like an issue
in which self-gov has failed, and we repair self-gov through student
action, not faculty action.  But, for whatever reason, I didn't feel
quite as betrayed as I did when I first heard about the incidents.

So things were feeling a bit better.

Then Michelle and I started our "give to charity instead of giving
presents" efforts.  We were working with a charity that claimed
that it made it easy to print out cards to send.  But the electronic
cards [7] they sent us (a) did not have the recipient's name, (b)
did not have the gift-giver's name, (c) did not list or describe
the gift given, and (d) did not print in any reasonable size.  Who
has envelopes for 5.5x8.5 inch cards?  It doesn't help that our HP
Wireless Printer is not particularly cooperative these days [8].

But Youngest Son is a whiz at these things.  So we turned the task
over to him.  I'm not sure that the hour spent re-doing the cards
in another program was a good use of his time, but at least we now
have cards to send.

Were there other good things today?  I got a hug from a valued colleague
when I was feeling pretty grumpy about all of this.  I enjoyed looking
at one of the painted rocks in the snow.  I got to muse.  And then there
are all the other regularly wonderful things in my life: my wife,
my kids, my job [9], my friends and colleagues, my quality of life.
Plus, at least one of my colleagues had no idea who Tony Stark is.

Were there other bad things today?  Of course.  But none live up to
the sense of betrayal associated with CS Table and the sense of
abandonment of responsibility associated with the declaration of major.
I wasn't productive, and that frustrates me.  But I accept that there
are unproductive days.

In any case, here's hoping that tomorrow goes better.  If not, I expect
that you'll read a lot of rants this week [10].

[1] My family kept me up late watching _Crisis on Infinite Earths_.

[2] I saw Kate on Friday and I was reminded that I wanted to muse
about her.

[3] I don't object to feeding random students.  I also donate regularly
to the College food pantry.  But our CS Table budget is to support
student discussions.

[4] Just to be clear, the fact that students experience food insecurity
is not a positive.  The fact that our department cares and that Grinnell
provides resources are positives.

[5] My experience with MINK-WIC also puts me in that frame of mind.
I spent a lot of time arranging the trip and the department used
funds to pay for student attendance.  However, multiple students
just decided not to attend and couldn't even be bothered to notify
someone.  Our departure was delayed while we tried to figure out why
they weren't there in time for the bus.  I'm glad that the students
who attended had a good time, but the students who abused the
opportunity made me furious.

[6] I'd still like to see the College increase the number of tenure-line
faculty.  It's just that I no longer have the annoying feeling that
the College added one-hundred students and won't add faculty.

[7] PDFs!

[8] Have I mentioned that I hate not only computers but also
computer peripherals?

[9] Even though it doesn't feel that way today.

[10] Come to think of it, you may read a lot of rants even if I'm
in a better mood.

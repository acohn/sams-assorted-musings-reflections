Logging my time (Week eight of Spring Semester 2018)
====================================================

_Number six in a series._

Week eight of spring semester was the last week before spring break.
I spent Sunday of the week traveling to and from Kansas City, Missouri,
to see the Grinnell Singers in action.  I also got to see a few alums I
like and have dinner with middle.  With that day off, what did my week
look like?

My, that's a strange week.  But at least it's a reasonable one, about
fifty hours if I don't count the musings.  The strangest thing is the
five hours in CSC 32x, since I'm scheduled to be in that course for six
hours per week.  But there weren't a lot of questions this week, I did
most of my prep over the previous weekend, and Friday was an optional class
in which I answered a few questions but mostly spent my time writing the
next CSC 151 exam, which meant that I counted it under CSC 151.

Of course, I mostly kept it at about fifty hours because (a) I had
no time on Sunday and (b) I was easing up a little in preparation for
spring break, which meant that I also did not spend a lot of time on
Friday night or Saturday.

I'm still spending too much time on departmental administrative matters.
But that should be better after spring break.  

I spent a lot of time in office hours this past week.  I'll admit that
I can't remember the details.  Some were with my CSC 151 students, some
were with my advisees, and some were with students I'd never met before
who wanted to talk about computing.  Since I set aside about five hours
per week for office hours, a bit more than four seems reasonable.

I introduced a new topic, "digital life", which refers to getting my
digital life in order.  The first task was dealing with my [failing
laptop](i-hate-computers-2018-03-11).

What else did I learn from logging?  Well, since I already pre-script
parts of my log (e.g., times in class, times preparing for class), I
decided to add some of the expected tasks for the day on the log, as
a very rough form of a to do list [1].  Unfortunately, I also found that
I was moving the things to do from day, to day, to day.  That problem
is one of the reasons I don't like to keep to-do lists.  There's always
an ever-increasing list of things that I hope to do the same day.

I had some interesting experiences thinking about how to correctly log
some time.  I've already mentioned the question of how to log a lab
day in CSC 322 when very few students showed up and those who did
preferred to work on their own.  In that case, I logged what I actually
did rather than the class time.  But I also had the question of how to
log an assignment that also became part of a musing [2].  In the end,
I decided that the part that I needed to write anyway

As in prior weeks, there were events that I wanted to make that I had
to miss.  We had a guest speaker on Monday with three different talks,
all of which I had to miss.  I still couldn't find time to attend
_Lighting the Page_.  I had hoped to start attending _How Colleges
Work_, but discovered that I really couldn't spare the time, at least
at that time of day.  I missed Scholar's Convocation, in part because
no one bothered to put a sign about Scholar's Convocation on Noyce 3rd [3].
We had a late Friday department meeting, and so I missed the "Council
Happy Hour".  As a colleague suggested, I can buy my own beer.  But I
like the opportunity to talk informally with colleagues.

On the other hand, I was able to attend a variety of other things.  I
attended a few meetings on Monday, one of which [made me angry](overloads)
and one of which made me happy [4].  I saw the high school band perform
on Tuesday night.  I attended the Science Teaching and Learning Group on
Wednesday where we had a nice conversation about how we connect students'
disciplinary learning to other disciplines and to the broader world.
I got to see a co-opted middle- and high-school jazz band concert on
Saturday [5].  And, of course, I got to see the Singers on Sunday.
That's not a bad ratio.

Postscript: It's now spring break.  Although I won't do a weekly log
analysis during spring break, it may be useful to go back and see how
much time I spent on each of the activities I had [planned for spring
break](planning-spring-break-2018).

[1] Yes, I'm also experimenting with a real to-do list.  At the
recommendation of a friend, I'm trying [Todoist](https://todoist.com/).
I'll report back on it, and on my general experience with to-do lists,
in a few weeks.

[2] The assignment + musing refers to the [CSC322 ethics
assignment](csc322-ethics-assignment), in case you weren't sure.

[3] Is it that hard to advertise our important speaking events?

[4] The one that made me happy was a group interview with the folks at
Ologie, our marketing firm.  I hope to report back on that in the next
few weeks.

[5] Those who attended know why I call it "co-opted".  I don't consider
it appropriate to say anything else publicly.

Down a (programming) language rabbit hole
=========================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

You know how the InterWeb leads you down random sequences of rabbit
holes, or at least down one rabbit hole into a maze of warrens [1]?
That happens to me, too.  Way too much.  Perhaps daily.  Once in a while,
I find it productive to muse about what's happened.  Why?  I'm not sure.
At times, the musings seem to serve as an alternate to bookmarks, since
they provide context.  At times, they give me an opportunity to reflect
on how my brain works.

Started at open textbooks in CS.
<http://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/SearchResults.aspx?subjectAreaId=3>.
Why? I think I was looking for possibilities for CSC 207 [2]

Noticed a few books about something called [Pharo](https://pharo.org).
Realized that Pharo is yet another variant of Smalltalk.

Hmmm ... I like Smalltalk.  How does Pharo differ?  That led me to
look up the differences between Smalltalk variants.  I knew that Squeak
had been a very popular dialect of  Smallalk.  Why would someone use
Pharo rather than Squeak?  And why would someone call a language Pharo?

Found [a quora
discussion](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-Smalltalk-and-Pharo).
That led me to a [page on medium about
Smalltalk](https://medium.com/smalltalk-talk/smalltalk-choices-6c39d09a40e6).

The same author had written something
they called "[The three worst programming
languages](https://medium.com/smalltalk-talk/the-three-worst-programming-languages-b1ec25a232c1)"
[3]. 
This
author links to more rants about languages, such as [this one
about C++](https://whydoesitsuck.com/cpp-sucks-for-a-reason/).
That, of course, led to [a discussion of
annoying programming languages the author "can't just
ditch"](https://whydoesitsuck.com/top-five-most-annoying-programming-languages/)

Let's see ... from textbook searching to learning about a new programming
language to reading rants about programming languages to musing about all
of that.

Where am I going with all this?  I don't know.  

I'm just amazed at how
far down the rabbithole I can go [4].  Or maybe that I appreciate that other
people rant about programming languages, too.

Note that the horror of a programming language is sometimes less about
the language and more about how the language is used.

[1] Or is that a warren of mzes?

[2] I'm planning on using whatever is available from the Osera textbook.
But I know that some colleagues were looking for alternatives.

[3] They claim that those are PHP, JavaScript, and C++.  

[4] Okay, it's not all that far.  It felt longer while I was falling.
Or perhaps it was just that I was spending time reading each thing 
along the way.

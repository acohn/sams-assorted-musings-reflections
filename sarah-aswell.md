Sarah Aswell '04 was just back on campus for _Learning from Alumni_
[1].  I didn't know Sarah well, although she says that many of my
students were her friends.  And we've been Plans-pals since soon
after she graduated [2].  When she listed some of the things she
did on campus, I realized that I had known her, at least a bit.
She was responsible for the _GUM_, back when it was a humor magazine
[4] rather than whatever it is now.  She had a column I read in the
S&B.  She published a book which I recall owning.  And she's
responsible for one of my favorite uses of the Tigger costume: It
plays a role in her Titular Head "Walk of Shame" film.  She tells
me that she spent way too much time getting grass stains out of it.
Plus, she wrote [an article on the duclod
man](https://www.advocate.com/politics/commentary/2007/03/12/chasing-duclod-man)
which I recall reading when it was published.

Aswell participated in at least three events on campus: A comedy
workshop for women, non-binary individuals, and others.  A talk in
LFA.  And a comedy show.  I was only able to make the LFA talk.
But I'm glad I did.  I think Aswell said many useful things, even
if I don't agree with all of them [5].

**_Postscript_**: You probably don't care, but here are most of the notes
I took during Aswell's talk, edited slightly.

Choose a job you love and you will never work a day in your live.  Confucious.

Sarah's comment: I've been struggling between doing what I love and
having food and shelter.

Should you make tiny hats for iguanas?

In college, If you're not passionate about something, it's hard to do well
at it.

Improv Troupe / Hearld Team.  Scarlett & Black Arts Editor.  The
GUM Editor.  Had a humor column (Au Fait).  Titular Head.  Put out
a book senior year.  Learned skills through these things.

My best advice for college

* Take classes for the professor, not the course
* Drop courses immediately if you see red flags 
    * Her example was anxiety in a class.
* Meet as many people as you can
    * Grinnell is filled with amazing people
    * Not networking: Community or friendship; Ability to call friends on
      the phone.
    * Don't stay in your clique.
* Start doing weird stuff NOW
* Take advantage of the college's resources
    * "I want to do a two-hour interpretive dance on Russian history."
* Get better grades than I did

Other notes

* Took Latin 102.  Three times.
* It's okay

TIme at Grinnell Herald-Register

* How to hit deadlines, always.
* You can call ANYONE on the phone and ask them things.  (And she has social
  anxiety.  But if you do it every day for a year, you learn to do it.)
* How to type and write super super fast.
* How to tell a story.
* How to tell a story to someone who doesn't care.
    * Her marketing skills come from that.

Graduate school: University of Montana

* Graduate school will be easier than Grinnell, I sear to G-d.
* Do anything in your power to get a TA or fellowship.
* Choose your school based on the teachers.  (Definitely true for writing programs.
  Look for people whose writing you like.)
* Yes, a good creative writing program is totally worth it.
    * Learned a lot about storytelling.
* Keep doing weird stuff.

New York City * The Publishing World

* Use your Grinnell network.
* Don't make firetrucks (firetruck factory) if you want to be a firefighter.
    * Hated her job.
    * Loved writing, but not publishing.
* It's perfectly okay to let go of dreams of visions.
* When you're depressed, investigate why!
* Don't be afraid to hit the EJECT button on your life.*

So sad in NYC

* Didn't like the mission of the company
* Didn't like big cities.
* Bad for mental health
* No sense of community
* Wasn't making art
* Don't like being told what to do

Escaping from a shitty career

* Started selling textbooks she found in the dumpster.  (The company is evil;
  that's okay.)  Saved up money.
* I started freelancing out of my cubicle.
* Took every possible sick day and vacation day and then gave notice.
* Married parter to get health insurance.
* Put a lot of faith in herself.

The Duclod Man

* Her article went viral.
* Moved back to Montana.  It's beautiful.

Five ideas writing

* Never stop at your first idea; everyone will have that idea.  It's not until
  your fifth idea that it's new.
* You have to sell your services and yourself constantly.
* You're going to hear NO 95% of the time.
* Confidence in a future version of yourself.

How can you start a business?  THrough reading.

* The biggest, most central thing you're learning at Grinnell is how to learn
  anything.
* A book + YouTube can teach you almost anything.
    * "We need a content strategist."  Yes, we provide that strategy.
* You can learn just as much from fiction as non-fiction
* Deidre McNamer - "Reading is an action"

Places she wrote for

* Personal injury attorneys
* Small local businesses (teamed with a designer)
    * Word also gets around
* The local independent weekly
* Then: Nike
    * Got to cover the olympics
    * Met world-class athletes

Five years of life

* And paid off $90K in student loans

Best advice for stand-up comedy also applies to life

* Confidence is the most imortant thing.
* No jokes are funny until you connect with the audience.
* Read the room. - Know who you are talking to.
* Nothing trumps stage time.  - You have to practice in front of people; you
  have to fail in front of people.
* You only learn from bombs.  It sucks.  It's an awful feeling.  But that's
  how you learn.

Freelance writing after comedy

* "I had so much more confidence."
* "I was happier."
* "I was more comfortable taking risks."
* "I was comfortable with failure.  I even liked it!"
* "Making iguana hats made me better at making regular hats."
* So then she started putting her writing out there.

Since startup

* The New Yorker
* McSweeney's
* Forbes - Writes a weekly column!
* Reductress - Contributing writer
* MAD Magazine - With them until they folded
* National Lampoon - With them until they folded
* Vulture
* Scary Mommy
* The Outline

And some books

* YA book about Kendrick Lamar

Comedy was not diverse.  Audience was not straight white youths.

* Started wandering around to bars asking if she could take it over for a night
* Made a list of barriers
    * No community for women only
    * No safe space
    * Lack of opportunity
    * Sexual harrassment / sexual assault - Fundraising shows to get people
      to train bartenders and such.
    * Money

    * No female bookers!
    * No allies
    * Lack of confidence
    * Bad audience
    * No mentors
    * No touring female comedians (coming through town) - Started flying them
      in.  Knocking on doors and asking for support.  Breaks even; doesn't make
      money.
    * Lack of instruction
    * Stereotypes about what standup is
    * Lack of a system or path forward
* Rules
    * At least 50% of all headliners are women/
    * I won't be the token woman on a show w/more than two people
    * I will pay all my preformers no matter what
    * I will call out people who book shows that aren't diverse
    * I will call out bookers who don't pay
* Made a lot of change in two and a half years

Tech company went to her show, said "I want your voice to be the voice of
my company."  Submittable

* A company with a strong and good mission
* A company that cares deeply about her community
* A company that trusts its employees and treats them well

  experiment and play.

Anxiety and mental health

* How can you have anxiety and be a standup.  Very easily!
* Therapy is good.
* And more

Storytelling is vital to every career.

* What's your story?  What's your elevator pitch?
* How does your story connect you to others?
* How is your story surprising or different?
* Are you being open and honest about who you are?
* Are you telling the tough parts of your story, too?

Happiness is about community and place

* The end goal doesn't have to be fame and fortune
* Engaging with your community will make you instantly happiest
* Finding your Place is just as important as finding a career and a "family"
* Acting locally is the only thing I've found that allows me to emotitionally tolerate the big, complicated world.
* "Change things that you can change."

Do cool shit to meet cool people.  It's an upward spiral.

[1] No, that's not the same as _Learning from CS Alumni_.  One course is
designed to work for all Grinnell students.  The other is primarily for
those in my department.  I'll let you guess which is which.

[2] I checked during one of her talks, and it appears that we are also
Facebook Friends and Twitter Tpals [3]

[3] The T is silent?

[4] _Grinnell's Unfunny Magazine_, or something like that.

[5] "Take classes for the professor, not the topic" was one of them.
I think it's okay to take a few classes from the professors many students
consider legendary, but those should not be the only classes you take.
I do appreciate her suggestion that a great professor may not be great
for everyone, and you should be prepared to change.

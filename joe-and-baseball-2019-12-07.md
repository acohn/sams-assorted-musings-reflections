Joe and baseball
================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnellians](index-grinnellians), short*

The other day, I had the opportunity to attend a panel on Joe
Rosenfield '25 led by George Drake '56.  During the Q&A session
after the panel, one alum stood up and told a story about Joe.  I
don't think the story made George's book on Joe.  We didn't record
the session [1].  So I thought I'd do my best to get something down
for posterity [3].

It went something like this.

> Everyone knows that Joe was a big fan of baseball [4].

> They may not know that Joe was instrumental in bringing baseball to
  Grinnell.

> When I started at Grinnell, Grinnell didn't have a team.  Joe wanted
  to change that.  So he paid for all of the equipment: the bats, the
  balls, the uniforms [5].

> When we played our first game at Fairgrounds [6], we were surprised
  to see a limousine pull up to the field.  It turns out that Joe had
  driven down from Des Moines to support us in our first game.

It's a nice little story that should be preserved.  I think it says
a lot about the ways that Joe was comfortable using his money in
support of the College and the things he liked.

I will admit that I was surprised that Grinnell did not have a
baseball team.  I see that there was a baseball team in 1868 and
it looks like we fielded a team until 1915.  But no team was fielded
between 1916 and 1956, which I expect was when Joe decided to re-form
[7] the team.  I wonder why the team disbanded in the early twentieth
century.  I guess I'll have to wait for the Wall/Bisson book to
find out.

[1] I know that the Rosenfield Program folks tried to get it recorded.
Unfortunately, Grinnell does not have good infrastructure for recording
these kinds of sessions [2].

[2] I'm still incredibly frustrated that no one thought to record
[Grant Gale](grant-gale)'s talk about Robert Noyce on the opening
of the Noyce Science Center.  I also would have liked to have us
preserve Gordon Moore's comments.

[3] Will my musings survive into posterity?  Who knows.  Maybe I'll
print them out and donate them to the archives when I retire.  For
this particular musing, perhaps the _Grinnell Magazine_ will pick
up the story.

[4] If I recall correctly, he was the largest minority investor in the
Chicago Cubs.

[5] I don't believe that the speaker mentioned Joe paying for the
coaches.  I'm not sure whether we just had student coaches in the
first years of baseball or whether we asked a coach from another
sport to help.  The [historical
record](https://pioneers.grinnell.edu/documents/2019/5/9//Season_by_Season_Overall_Team_Records_Update.pdf?id=1201)
that I found lists no coach from 1957 to 1969.

[6] No, not the swimming house.

[7] No, not reform.

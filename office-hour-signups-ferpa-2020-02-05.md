Sometime last semester, as I was reading excerpts from the minutes
of Grinnell's Executive Council [1], I learned that some folks
consider it a FERPA violation to post sign-up sheets for office
hours outside of our offices.  If I recall correctly, the question
raised was why it is not permissible to have sign-up sheets for
office hours, but it is permissible to have people visit classes
[4].

For those who don't know, FERPA is the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act, which specifies that institutions should limit how
they release students' educational records.  IANAL/IANAFO [4] so
you should take everything I say [5] about FERPA with a grain [6]
of salt.  As I understand it, there are at least three related
issues at play in many of the situations we consider under FERPA.
Certainly, there are the FERPA policies themselves.  But beyond
those policies, there are also more general, but equally important, 
questions about student privacy, along with differently important
questions about student safety.

Here's what I understand about office-hour sign-up sheets: The
general sheets don't violate FERPA since students could be signing
up to meet with you for a variety of reasons.  However, they do
potentially put students at risk because they permit someone to
know where a student will be at a certain time.  The second issue
suggests that while public general office-hour sign-ups do not
violate FERPA, they may not be a good practice [8].  In contrast,
sign-ups that are tied to specific classes or to advising may violate
FERPA because they reveal that a student is in a particular class
or has a particular person as their academic advisor, both of which
are often considered part of students' academic records.  Compared
to some other releases of information, these are relatively minor.
Nonetheless, they could be considered risky, particularly as our
society gets more litigious.

I will admit that I have not worried about these issues because I
primarily use electronic signups for office hours[9].  I didn't
choose them for FERPA or safety reasons; rather, I find that they
make it easier for me to tell what slots are available when a student
emails to ask "Can I meet with you at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow?" or
something similar.

The ways in which we approach FERPA don't always make a lot of sense
to me.  I recall being told for many years that I should not list
the names of my research students in my CV or on the Web, except
in publications or when students choose to list themselves.  Why?
Because doing so reveals that they did research with me.  Then the
Dean's Office started publishing a public list of all the MAP
students and, after some conversations with FERPA officers at other
institutions, our FERPA officer determined that the Dean's Office's
practice was acceptable, which suggests that listing on CVs is also
acceptable.  I forget the reasons why.

Of course, there are many ways in which the broader FERPA policies
also don't make a lot of sense to me.  For example, we have multiple
contractors who can access FERPA-protected data, including
convicted felons [10].  To deal with those issues, we typically
designate those contractors Officers of the College with a legitimate
educational interest in accessing the data, or something like that
[11].  You'd think that we would, therefore, have a legal responsibility
to inform students which contractors have access to data.  However,
my conversations with our FERPA officer suggest that we do not, and
I cannot find anything in the FERPA guidelines or FAQs that contradict
that claim.  I'd still prefer that students know the dozen or more
outside contractors that regularly have access to their data, but
that's not my decision.  And I'd really prefer that it be part of
the law.  What do I know?  IANAL/IANAFO.

These issues also remind me about [the new and somewhat scary
practice of recording student attendance through phone
tracking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/24/colleges-are-turning-students-phones-into-surveillance-machines-tracking-locations-hundreds-thousands/).
It's not happening at Grinnell [12] but it seems to be happening
at other institutions.  I wonder how schools are dealing with the
issue that these apps (and, more importantly, the owners of those
apps) have access to FERPA-protected information.  While Degree
Analytics does mention FERPA on their [privacy
page](https://degreeanalytics.com/privacy/), I couldn't find anything
on the SpotterEDU site.

Back to the main issues.  In spite of my concerns about how FERPA
makes faculty work more difficult, I consider FERPA a reasonable
law.  Students are adults and adults deserve some privacy.  While
many have good relationships with their families, not all do.  I
realize that FERPA frustrates many parents, I'd rather have policies
in place that protect students who want to keep some aspects of
their lives private from their parents or others in similar positions.

Plus, FERPA makes my job easier: "Can I talk to you about my child's
work in your class?"  "You can certainly talk to me, but FERPA suggests 
that I can't say anything in response."  Fortunately, I don't have
to have that conversation all that often.

**_Postscript_**: I've been told that "Office Hours" is a term that
needs explaining to some students.  Some hear that and assume it means
"The time my faculty member has reserved for themselves in their
office" rather than "The time my faculty member has reserved for
students".  Perhaps "Student Hours" would be better.

[1] Those excerpts are generally available as part of the agenda
for faculty meetings.  I learn a lot by reading them [2].  Sometimes
I misread them [3].  Sometimes they frustrate me, such as when a
Council member misstates a policy.  But that's not the point.  What
is the point?  Oh, that's right.  Excerpts are available to members
of the campus community and I make it a practice to read them.

[2] Nope, I'm not going to tell you what I've learned.  You can
read them yourselves, at least if you have access.  If you don't
have access, I shouldn't be telling you.

[3] No, not intentionally.

[4] The relationship between the two is that both can reveal that
students are in a particular class, which is FERPA-protected
information.

[4] I am not a lawyer and I am not a FERPA officer.

[5] Or write, in the case of this musing.

[6] Or granary [7].

[7] Why is it "granary" not "grainary"?

[8] Isn't it sad that we have to worry about such things?

[9] Formerly with youcanbook.me, now with Acuity Scheduling, someday
with something I write myself.

[10] At least that's how one of my colleagues likes to refer to
Microsoft.

[11] It's a common hack to deal with the issue of which Cloud
Services have access to FERPA-protected data, such as email or
student records.  By making them Officers of the College, we can
legally store our information on their servers.  And, if they breach
FERPA, they now bear the responsibility.  It also means that we
don't have to record the sharing of the data with them.  Or something
like that.  As I said, IANAL/IANAFO.  [One of the FERPA
FAQs](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/SRO_FAQs_2-5-19_0.pdf)
says

> Contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third parties to whom a school or district has outsourced certain functions may be also be considered "school officials." Schools and districts may disclose education records (and the PII contained in those records), without appropriate consent to such school officials provided that they (1) perform an institutional service or function for which the school or district would otherwise use employees; (2) are under the "direct control" of the school or district with respect to the use and maintenance of the education records; (3) are subject to FERPA’s use and re-disclosure requirements set forth in 34 CFR § 99.33(a); and (4) satisfy the criteria specified in the school or district’s annual notification of FERPA rights for being "school officials" with "legitimate educational interests" in the education records

[12] At least I hope it's not happening at Grinnell.  I'd like to see new
PCard privacy policies.

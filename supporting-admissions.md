Supporting our admissions office
================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell)*

Our admissions office has an incredibly important job: They bring us the
excellent students that inhabit our classrooms and campus.  While I am
sometimes critical about the things they do or lead the College to do
(e.g., limit posting on the Web site, develop marketing campaigns that
use strange slogans), I very much appreciate what they do and do what I
can support them.  How do faculty support admissions.  Attend events.
Allow students to visit classes.  Write to prospective students.
Post long, drawn-out criticisms of the College.  No, probably not that
last thing.  Provide more information about the department that I think
will help.  Keep our Web site up to date (Whoops).

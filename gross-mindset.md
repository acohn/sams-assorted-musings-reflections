Gross Mindset
=============

My colleagues in academic advising keep telling me that the faculty should
be developing something called a "gross mindset".  I'm not quite sure
what they mean, and I'm too lazy to look up articles or read a book,
so I'm writing this essay to figure out the gross mindset, and how it
applies in different disciplines.

Teaching a gross mindset in Biology seems pretty straightforward.  If a
student says something like "Biological processes are so cool", you just
emphasize the blood and guts.  If they think blood and guts are cool,
you have them disect decomposing things.  If all else fails, you make
everyone disect decomposing things, and peer pressure will win out.  You
can also have them eat dinner with ER doctors and med students [1].

In 2016, teaching a gross mindset in any foreign language seems nearly
as straightforward.  A student might think that "It's so amazing that I
get to learn a foreign language!  I'll develop more insight into another
culture, expose myself to new literature, and probably even learn more
about my own culture and language."  However, we need only remind them
that in the upcoming Trumptatorship [2], evidence of foreign language
knowledge will be considered so disgusting that anyone who speaks 
anything other than 'murcan will be waterboarded and then deported [3].
We need to convince our students *now* that foreign languages are gross,
before it's too late!

How do I teach the gross mindset in my own field, computer science?
I think the following might help [4].  "To determine whether a pointer
variable points to a valid area of memory, I set a global variable to
false, set the signal handler to change that variable to true, attempt
to dereference the variable, unset the signal handler, and check the
value of the global variable."  Alternately, I could just teach them
"[convention over configuration]<http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration>".

Okay, maybe teaching the gross mindset isn't as hard as I think.  In
Polisci, we can discuss the techniques that dictators use to stay in 
power.  In Anthropology, we can discuss sacrificial rituals of ...
In English ...  In studio art and tech theatre, we can show them accidents 
in the shop.

Math may be the easiest.  "Why am I learning math?  Math is gross."
"Right!" [5]

Physics seems similarly easy.  "You do realize that Physics is just math,
don't you?"  "Gross!" [6]

Yup, I think I can do it.  I can teach the gross mindset and help others
do so, too.  Whaddaya know?  I can develop new skills and approaches.

What?  They said I should teach students a [growth
mindset](growth-mindset.html)?  Nevermind.

[1] Those of you attached to ER doctors and med students (or former
med students) will understand.

[2] Not to be confused with the brand-new "Trump 'tater chips".

[3] In case the unlikely happens: The text associated with this note
is my attempt to pander to my liberal audience.  It does not reflect
my own opinions on our soon-to-be-great nation.

[4] If you don't program in C or a similar language, this may not make
sense to you.  If you are [Ian Atha](ian-atha.html), it may bring back
terrifying memories.

[5] As a former mathematics major, I can tell you that math is awesome.

[6] While Physics is just math, the appropriate response is "awesome!"

Marketing Grinnell
==================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), marketing, longish, rambly*

Some time this week, we will get a new "Brand Book".  Here's the announcement
we got in the campus memo.

> The Office of Communications will begin distributing copies of "Our
Grinnellian Story," to faculty and staff this week. The goal of this
booklet is to provide a common language as we work together to tell the
story of this special place - the story of individually advised learning
for the intellectually engaged. Our strong academic program, a globally
informed community, and our commitment to purposeful life preparation
combine to express the College's unique value proposition. We hope you
find this publication useful and inspiring. [1]

I thought it would be useful to reflect on general issues marketing
*before* we get the new brand book.  I don't know how I'll react to the
brand book, but a pre-brand-book reflection strikes me as something more
neutral, a reflection that will be neither positively nor negatively
affected by the brand book.  Here goes.

Grinnell faces a difficult challenge.  How do you convince people,
particularly who can afford something like sticker price [2], that
Grinnell is the gem [3] we all know it is?

Grinnell provides an excellent education, with strong and integrated
curricular and co-curricular components.  We have faculty who are both
strong scholars and innovative teachers.  Our students are committed to
struggling with complex issues in challenging classes.  We have a long
tradition of social justice.

But most of our peers and near peers can also speak about their commitment
to social good, about local and global engagement, about an integrated
liberal arts experience, and about close student-faculty interactions.
Even if we do many of those things better than our peers [4], how would
you convince a prospective student [5] of that, particularly since many
would normally dismiss a school in "flyover country" or worry about the
distance from Grinnell to the nearest airport?  (Or, more recently, who
worry about the way the Iowa Legislature impinges upon a women's bodies.)

It's hard to show a prospective student what's unique about Grinnell,
other than the individually mentored curriculum.   In fact, we hear from
our admissions office that most prospectives know about and acknowledge
the excellent academic program.  It's just not enough to convince them
to come here.

So we need a marketing campaign.

If the banners with two-word phrases
hanging around campus and [the branding
page](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/communications/brand/promise)
are representative, I'm worried about what our new one will be.
I appreciate that we are preparing students to "navigate the world's
complexities".  But you don't do that with simplistic [6] phrases.

As a Grinnellian said to me recently,

> Marketing has never worked for Grinnell because marketing and the
language of marketing is the antithesis of what Grinnell teaches.

But we do need to convince people to choose Grinnell, and we need to do
so for a wide variety of people, not just students who benefit from a
top-notch education at a bargain rate.

"No limits" wasn't the answer.

Banners with two-word phrases aren't the answer.

Awkward noun phrases [7] aren't the answer.

I appreciate the central concept of the current campaign, even if I
would not phrase it that way.

> Individually advised learning for the intellectually engaged so
they can navigate the world's complexities and contribute with great
responsibility.

Nonetheless, I worry whether it suffices.  I don't think it distinguishes
us significantly from our peers.  And, as importantly, the awkward phrases
that are scattered throughout the campaign undermine the attention to
language that should be core to Grinnell's identity [8].

So what should we do?

I wish I had a good answer.

So let me brainstorm.

Idea the first: We need to change Grinnell to make it more distinctive.
We should not discard the things that make Grinnell great.  But we might
find ways to enhance some of those things so that they clearly distinguish
the College.  What new things might be valuable enough that they'd convince 
someone to come here, or at least to consider us more deeply.  That
requires some deep reflection [9].  It requires a willingness to change.
Both are difficult to achieve.

Idea the second: Embrace complexity.  Let's start with some really draft
marketing text.

> Investigate Grinnell.  We're sorry, but we don't have a simple tagline
or phrase to describe Grinnell College.  Central to a Grinnell education
is an understanding that most complex issues cannot and should not be
reduced to a simple answer, comment, or phrase.  Grinnellians approach
issues and decisions with a deep understanding of the need to embrace
that complexity and to employ a variety of tools to explore and unpack
related issues.

> If you're right for Grinnell, you won't pay attention to our marketing.
Rather, you'll investigate the College.  You'll look at the kinds of
research our faculty and students do, the initiatives our students develop,
and the creative pedagogy that undergirds the institution.

> We won't delay you any longer.  Go take a look.  If what you discover
sounds interesting, feel free to contact us at admissions@grinnell.edu
to schedule a more detailed exploration, one in which you can meet
with faculty, students, and staff and develop your own deeper understanding
of the institution.

> If you don't want to take the effort, that's okay.  We only want 
students who embrace hard work and complexity.

Think of the power of a student discovering on their own that Grinnell
trusted students to write _The Grinnell Guide to Writing_, that _The
Grinnell Beowulf_ was developed by a team of students and a faculty
member, that _BIO 150_ is in incredibly innovative introductory course
that treats students as experimental scientists from day one, rather than
throwing bookloads of facts at them, that our alums have transformed
the world in many ways, that we are so supportive of free speech that
we allow a curmudgeonly old faculty member to post critical articles
on the College site, that we have sociology classes in which students
build Web sites that reflect on divergent communities, that our computer
science department's curriculum is one of only four curricular exemplars
in international CS education standards, that we are trailblazers in
the digital liberal arts, that we have interdisciplinary courses in which
students travel abroad as part of their studies, and so much more [10].

Of course, that approach would require that more of the great aspects
of Grinnell be out in the open, rather than behind a password wall.  We'd
need a public Web site that is intended to support current students and 
faculty, rather than the marketing-oriented approach we embraced a few
years ago [11].

They'll also discover many things that are wrong with Grinnell.  But those
things are also easy to discover, perhaps easier to discover than the
good things.  Each issue of _[The Scarlet and
Black](http://www.thesandb.com/)_ reveals many of our problems.
Hopefully, our investigative prospective students will understand
that many of those negatives relate to some underlying positive.  Yes,
students criticize the Trustees' decision on divestment.  But we had a
deep, thoughtful process that included students [14].

Would this second marketing strategy work?  Probably not.  We've already
learned that our academics are not enough to attract students.  But
maybe it's worth trying something different.  We might even add
something like the following.

> Rather than polluting the environment with large, glossy folders
or plastic toys that you will soon discard, we think it best to send
only a short note and to point you to our Web site.  Please come explore.

Could I get someone to take these suggestions seriously?  Since it didn't
take terrifyingly large amounts of money to develop, it's unlikely.  And,
given the world of higher-ed admissions, I bet someone has done something
like this already.

In any case, it's also unlikely that I have any say in the matter.
So I'll just cross my fingers that I'm wrong and that the current campaign
turns out to be meaningful, powerful, and successful.  I'll even do my
best to support it, as long as I see those in authority supporting it,
too [17,18,19].

[2] And every other prospective Grinnell student and parent.

[3] No, not the Jewel of the Prairie.

[4] We do a few things worse, too.  It depends on the peer.

[5] Or, more accurately, a prospective prospective student.  Or perhaps
the parents or family of that prospective prospective student.

[6] With a strange/complex structure.

[7] "Liberal arts and mentored research that equips Grinnellians to pursue ideas and knowledge with confidence."  Taken from <https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/communications/brand/promise>.

[8] I realize that I don't always pay enough attention to my language,
either.  But I'm writing a daily musing, not materials that are intended
to convince careful thinkers to attend this institution.

[9] For those who are comfortable with shallower reflection, I'll do
my best to suggest one possibility in the next few days.

[10] Wow, that was a long sentence.  I hope that they don't discover that
sentence.

[11] I did say this was a rant, right?  [12] Five or so years have passed
since the great Web site restructuing and we not only have many great
things hidden, but also lack a public plan on how we're moving forward
on things that should more easily available.

[12] No.  It appears that I did not.  Since the focus is not the rant
about our Web site, I'll leave this as a non-rant.

[14] Sometimes you have to embrace the process even if the outcome is not
one you'd choose [15].

[15] You might think that I'd say the same thing about marketing.  But
I don't embrace the process, which I think has left faculty voices out
of a lot of the core decisions, such as the language used [16].

[16] For example, at the last faculty meeting in which we discussed the
marketing strategy, many faculty members raised concerns about the
quality of language used in the draft materials.  I don't think it made
a difference.

[17] A good starting point would be to fix the broken logo.

[18] I'd also like to see better language.  I hope that's not a pipe dream.

[19] Oh, yeah, I'd also expect that we post clear descriptions of the
two-word phrases and explain what "mentored research" we provide in
each department and across the College.

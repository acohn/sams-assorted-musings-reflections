It's the end of May.  It seems like it's time to reflect on the
past month of musing.  

I'll admit that I sometimes find myself
challenged to write this initial paragraph, since I've written
similar paragraphs before [1,2].  But for those who are not long-term
readers, I will note that at the end of most months, I step back and
reflect on the state of my musings.  The reflections can be about 
ways in which I write differently; after all, one reason I write daily
is to affect how I write.  The reflections often include data [3] about
how much I've mused and how many outstanding topics reside in my 
sketchbooks.  I may consider particular topics I've mused about and
perhaps even look for patterns.  Things like that.

Enough of that.  Let's move on to the actual reflections.

On my writing
-------------

Struggled to write on many days.  More precisely, struggled to finish 
writing.  I'd start a piece, become dissatisfied, and stop.  Perhaps it's 
that I was already writing for Ralph's class.  Perhaps it that I can't
write in multiple styles during the same time period.  Perhaps I'm learning
to become too critical.  But those days were hard.

Harley's comment: In attempt to make your writing better, let's
hope you don't lose what makes your writing good.  You have a voice.
Keep it.

On posting frequency
--------------------

Took a vacation or two or three.  (Family weekend, SIGCSE, Oberlin)

Follow-ups to individual musings
--------------------------------

Broader issues

Behind the scenes
-----------------

Other issues
------------

Missed an opportunity.  Musing 1010 could have been about the former
celebration of the first paycheck, or someone's birthday, or Ultimate,
or something like that.  But [I've mused about that celebration
before](ten-ten).  It's not clear I needed to write anything more.

Data
----

What does my sketchbook look like?

* I have N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need minor revisions"
* I have another N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need major
  revisions".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Short".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Long".  

Looking ahead

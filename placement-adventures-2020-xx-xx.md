As I mentioned in [a previous musing](joc-placement-adventures-2020-xx-xx),
this fall, instead of putting all of the placement letters in student
mailboxes, I had to email the placement letters to all of them.

One of the advantages (or perhaps disadvantages) of sending email is that
students reply.  As long as I'm replying to the students, I might as well
put the replies in a musing [1].

Why didn't you reply to my email of four months ago?

> I apologize for not replying to your earlier email message.  If you read my musings (as you said you do), you know that I'm usually busy enough that things get lost.  Your message was one of those.

I wasn't planning to take courses in these areas.  Is it a requirement
that I do so?

> There is no requirement that you take any particular discipline.  However, many students do take courses in Mathematics (and also Computer Science and Statistics), so we try to give every student information about where they should start, much as our language departments send out placement letters.  

Should I learn vim? [2]

> I think so, but I know that different programmers have different experiences.  I have a student who does much more with vim than I do.  Last week, they showed me a program they wrote to transfer the Teams chat to vim.  They've also set up vim mode for their shell, so they can do all of the normal editing moves on their commands.  I'm not sure if they have time to talk, but if you give me permission, I will share your email address with them.
 
Could I ask what this tentative placement was based on?

> We primarily use your high-school grades and your scores on standardized tests in making the tentative placement.

Why does my letter not include my AP scores?

> We're doing the placements much earlier than we normally do.  And the folks at ETS are a bit behind.  So we don't have all of the AP scores yet.  The faculty understand that and will be happy to redo the placement based on what they discuss with you.

Here's my long list of programs I've written.  Where should I start in the CS major?

> You will likely be a complex placement case.  While you've done a lot, it may not correspond naturally to what we cover in the introductory sequence.  And we've been known to do strange things like have students start in CSC 151 and then skip CSC 161.  For CSC 151, we look for clear understanding of functional programming concepts, particularly comfort with anonymous functions and higher-order procedures like map and compose.  And we expect you to be able to think recursively, including with structural recursion.  For CSC 161, we look for knowledge of C that includes comfort with pointers and linked structures.  For CSC 207, we look for the range of data structures you can implement, your knowledge of core sorting algorithms and ability to analyze the running time, and your understanding of core object-oriented-design principles.  A conversation is necessary.  I'll provide information on how to meet with us in a follow-up message.

And there you have it.  I've fixed placement software.  I've developed new
affiliated software.  I've responded to email.  Why do I agree to such
things?  Oh, that's right.  It supports our students.  And it supports
our departments.  Two good reasons.

Still, it's all been time outside of my nine-month contract.  Can
I bill someone for all this work?

[1] I am [on hiatus](on-hiatus-2020-07-23) from posting musings,
not from writing them.

[2] Not all of the questions were directly related to placement.

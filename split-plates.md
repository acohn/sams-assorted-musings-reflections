Pricing strategies that confuse me
==================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

I ate out this evening.  The restaurant had a pricing strategy that
confused me.  Main dishes did not include a side salad or soup.  But
you could add one for $2.00.  That part made sense.

What didn't make sense was that you could instead pay $2.00 for a 
"split plate", in which case both parties get a side salad or soup.
Well, I guess that makes sense, too, at least when viewed in
isolation.  What really doesn't make sense is to have both policies.

It's nice that they provide twice as much for the same $2.00.  And,
when we were a young married couple, Michelle and I would have appreciated
the savings.  But it's more food and more labor for the restaurant.
Why does the split plate cost the same?

Does anyone other than me wonder about such things?

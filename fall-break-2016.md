Fall Break, Two Thousand and Sixteen, Common Era
================================================

This fall break was supposed to be different.  Usually, I plan to use
fall break to catch up on the enormous amount of work that has built
up over the first half of fall semester.  But I'd promised Michelle
that I wouldn't work.  I even cancelled my registration for the Grace
Hopper Celebration so that I'd have time with Michelle.

What did I do?  Not much.

Slept.

Slept some more.

Read a bit.

Tried to straighten.  Failed.

Ignored a lot of administrative email.

Got sick on the last day.

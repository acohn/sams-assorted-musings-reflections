The joy of upgrades
===================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), technology*

Today, Grinnell upgraded its Exchange server to use two-factor authentication
with Duo [1].  I thought I had prepared myself.  I've been using Duo for
remote login since the spring.  I checked [the list of supported clients](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/its/ServiceCatalogPages/Multi%20Factor%20Authentication%20(MFA).aspx [2]).
Both iOS mail and macOS mail seemed to be supported.  I'm pretty sure that
I even called over to ITS to re-verify, especially since my colleagues
were getting email messages that their clients were not supported.

This morning, I went to check my email on my iPhone [3].  I kept
getting an "Incorrect Password" message [4].  It took me a few
minutes to remember that today was the rollout day for two-factor
authentication [5].  Instead of bothering the folks at ITS, I decided
to try dealing with the issue myself.  I found that removing my
Exchange account and re-adding it solved the problem [6].  Yay me! 

While I was doing that, I was reading email on my Mac.  The standard
Macintosh email client seemed to be working fine.  Or so I thought.
Then came the afternoon.  It, too, was now issuing error messages.
I hate deleting my Grinnell Exchange account from my Mac because
it usually takes a day or two to rebuild the mailbox.  So I called ITS
to see if there was an option other than "Delete the account and then
add the account".  There wasn't.  So I deleted the account, and my Mac
deleted all the corresponding email from my hard drive [7].

Then I went to add the account back.  And, well, I couldn't.  I
kept getting authorization failures.  So I called ITS back.  And I
learned that Mail.app on macOS 10.12 (Sierra) does not support the
authorization framework that the College wants.  I therefore need
to upgrade to 10.14 (Mojave).  Whee!  I'd swear that information
wasn't on the page when I checked it a month or so ago.

I feel somewhat foolish upgrading to Mojave when Catalina is coming
out in a few weeks.  But I don't really have any options [8].  And
I tend to be a late adopter, so I would not have been likely to upgrade
to Catalina immediately in any case [9].

I'm not sure why, but upgrading is a slow process.  Once I downloaded
and ran the installer [10], it indicated that installation would take
4.5 hours.  Whee!  At least I could pretend to do other work while it
was installing [11].

[1] And, perhaps, other services.

[2] That document is behind a password wall.

[3] It's an iPhone 5S.  It's starting to get old enough that Duo doesn't
quite trust it.

[4] That message is paraphrased.

[5] Or maybe it was yesterday.

[6] Further conversations with ITS suggest that (a) I chose the appropriate
process and (b) the need to remove/reinstall the account is a known issue,
but Apple does not have it clearly documented.

[7] At least I think it did.  I suddenly had much more space available
on the hard drive.

[8] That's not quite true.  I could use Outlook for Mac.  That seems less
palatable to me than upgrading my OS.  Maybe I should give Outlook
a chance.  But not today.

[9] Sidecar seems to be an appealing technology, so I may upgrade more
quickly than normal.

[10] Or part of the installer.

[11] Writing this musing falls within that model.

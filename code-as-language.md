Code as language
================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), education*

One of the many newsletters I still receive included a
link to [an article in _language magazine_ entitled "Senate Bill Counts
Coding for Language Requirement"](https://www.languagemagazine.com/2018/07/12/senate-bill-counts-coding-for-language-requirement/).  The article says that

> The proposal has the stated goal of "boosting high school coding
programs," but grants are awarded to schools that allow students to
replace a required course in "mathematics, science, or foreign language"
with computer coding.

Now, that's not quite the same thing as saying that coding counts as
a language requirement.  But it's troublesome.  Computer science may have
science in its name, but it isn't really science [1].  It's not math,
either.  However, given [the many problems with high-school mathematics
courses](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf),
a CS course could be an interesting alternative to providing students
think more formally.

But what about replacing a non-native language course [2] with a
CS course?  That's one of those topics that people keep talking about.
I even recall a graduate student who convinced his committee to let Fortran
serve as his foreign language.  But every time I hear that suggestion,
I dismiss it.  There are a lot of reasons to learn another language.
Almost none of them apply to computer languages.

Let's see what the article says.  After all, it's from a language whose
tagline is "Improving Literacy and Communication".

> Most linguists argue that coding should not be considered a true
language as it lacks the ambiguity and redundancy of a natural language.

"[A]mbiguity and redundancy".  *That's* how they defend natural languages?
That's depressing.  Here's some of what I'd say [3].

> As much as some people want to deny it, The world is increasingly global.
Learning another language prepares students to interact with people from
another place [4].

> Language courses are about more than language.  Learning a natural
language other than your native language exposes you to a culture other
than your native culture.  And, as you might expect, learning another
culture can not only help students better understand their own culture,
it can also help them be more receptive to a variety of viewpoints and
approaches.

> Courses in another language teach you about the structure of your own
language.  I hear again and again from students who tell me that they only
understood the structure of sentences in English or the concept of something
like the subjunctive mood when they learned them in another language.

> I'm not a neuroscientist, but I'm pretty sure that computer languages
(and computer programming) exercise a different part of your brain than
do natural languages.  There's likely some overlap.  But CS is more
about formal thinking than it is about language.

I'll admit that there are some similarities between non-native natural
languages and computer languages.  Both generally feel "foreign" to
someone as they learn them.  Both require you to understand how to
structure "statements".  Most importantly, both natural language and
computer languages serve as tools to communicate ideas.  As I tell my CS
students, computer languages convey algorithms not only to the computer,
but also to other humans.  But computer languages are only intended to
convey a narrow range of ideas: algorithms and ways of structuring data.
In contrast, natural languages are intended to convey a much broader
range of ideas.  Given a choice, I'd prefer to encourage students to
express themselves broadly.

Does this mean that I oppose the idea of adding CS classes to high
schools?  Certainly not.  I find great benefit in helping students
think computationally.  I also accept that knowing how to program is
currently one of the ways to enhance your economic standing [5].  But
replacing language with CS?  No way, no how.

Postscript: I realize that I promised not to write any rants this month.
However, this is not a rant about my job.  I don't know if that makes
it okay, but I don't case.  It's not something that I was willing to
let sit for a few more weeks.

[1] There are some ways in which computer science can be a science.  On
some frontiers of CS, there's a lot of hypothesis-driven experimental
research.  But what they teach in a high-school CS class is generally
how to design and write programs.  And that's not science.

[2] I've started to try to avoid the term "foreign language" since
every language is foreign to someone and native to someone else.

[3] That's not just what I'd say.  It's also what part of what I
normally say when someone suggests treating a computer language as a
foreign language.  I usually add a more disparaging comment, too, such
as "That's a ludicrous idea".

[4] I disagree with the careerization of high-schools.  But I do know
that "able to communicate in another language" is a valued skill by many
employers.

[5] I do worry that once enough people know how to program, that knowledge
will become devalued.  And I worry that we are already at the point that
most HR people can't tell the difference between a good programmer and
a merely competent programmer and, because of that, make choices based
on bad criteria.

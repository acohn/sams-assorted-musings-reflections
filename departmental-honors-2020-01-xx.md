Recently, I reflected on [Grinnell's requirements for students to receive
honors in computer science](honors-in-cs-2020-01-13).  In doing so,
I decided to look up the requirements for all the departments at Grinnell.
Here goes.

---

**Anthropology**

To be considered for honors in anthropology, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must (1) take classes in each of the four subfields of the discipline, (2) have conducted original research judged worthy of honors by the faculty, and (3) exemplify professionalism in fulfilling commitments voluntarily undertaken within the department.

**Art History**

To be considered for honors in art history, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must demonstrate, by departmental consensus, superior performance in coursework combined with superior breadth or depth of curriculum.

**Biological Chemistry**

To be considered for honors in biological chemistry, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must complete an independent research project, publicly present the work in seminar format at Grinnell, and demonstrate excellence in the work. The public presentation is satisfied automatically by all students who participate in the chemistry department summer research program.  Other students are expected to satisfy this requirement by presenting in the biology or chemistry seminar programs, but other equivalently formal public presentation settings may be considered.  Achieving Honors also requires that you contribute to the program in other ways, for example, by attending seminars, being a teaching assistant or mentor, serving on the SEPC (Student Educational Policy Committee), or participating in outreach activities. The faculty believes that graduating with honors in biological chemistry should not be regarded solely as the completion of set of requirements, but rather that honors signify demonstrated academic excellence and an unusually high commitment and dedication to the discipline.

**Biology**

To be considered for honors in biology, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must conduct an independent research project (either at Grinnell or elsewhere) and share their findings with fellow biologists in a departmental seminar. The award of honors is not based solely on grades and achievement in the classroom or lab. It signifies, in addition, an underlying commitment to the discipline as evidenced by participation in departmental affairs and activities (e.g., acting as a teaching assistant or mentor, or serving on the SEPC), including regular attendance at departmental seminars.

**Chemistry**

To be considered for honors in chemistry, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must be selected by the chemistry faculty. The criteria used to decide which students have achieved sufficient distinction and academic excellence to qualify for honors in chemistry are both objective and subjective in nature. Honors signifies an underlying commitment to the discipline as evidenced by participation in departmental affairs and activities (such as serving as a mentor), attendance at co-curricular activities such as departmental seminars and poster presentations both on and off campus, and other indications of strong interest above and beyond normal classroom participation and achievement. The faculty believes that honors signifies both academic excellence and an unusually high commitment and dedication to the discipline. Graduating with honors in chemistry should not be regarded solely as the culmination of previous accomplishments, but rather an expectation of future accomplishments in the discipline in the years ahead.

**Chinese**

To be considered for honors in Chinese, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must demonstrate consistently superior performance in departmental classes and exemplify substantial commitment to departmental goals.

**Classics**

To be considered for honors in classics, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must show superior performance in coursework in classics, combined with superior breadth or depth of curriculum.

**Computer Science**

To be considered for honors in computer science, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must also demonstrate exceptional commitment to the discipline and its values, as evidenced by significant engagement in the department and excellence in computing-related work, both in the classroom and beyond.

**Economics**

To be considered for honors in economics, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must demonstrate to the department’s satisfaction that they have achieved depth and breadth in their course of study.

**English**

To be considered for honors in English, graduating seniors must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5 and a major GPA of 3.75 by the end of their seventh semester.  In special circumstances students may be nominated by two or more faculty members for honors based on other scholarly achievements or contributions to the department.

**French**

To be considered for honors in French, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must complete two 300-level seminars, with at least one seminar taken in the senior year.  In addition, students must be recommended by the faculty in French, based on performance in seminars.

**Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies**

To be considered for honors in Gender, Women’s, and Sexuality Studies (GWSS), graduating seniors must achieve a GPA of 3.6 in the major and a GPA of 3.5 overall. As determined by a consensus of the GWSS committee: students must also demonstrate excellent performance in classes; a breadth of courses, indicated by at least one course taken from each of the major’s four rubric categories; and a commitment to the field of GWSS as evidenced by strong interest above and beyond completion of the major. Students who have met the GPA requirement will be invited to submit a brief statement (250-300 words) in which they describe what they would tell a prospective student about the GWSS major; only students who chose to submit such statements will be considered for honors in Gender, Women’s, and Sexuality Studies.

**General Science**

To be considered for honors in general science, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must take at least two four-credit courses at the 300 level or above in their departments of concentration and must complete a scientific research project and publicly present the results on campus.

**German Studies**

To be considered for honors in German Studies, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must complete GRM-499, demonstrate superior performance in their coursework in the major, and make contributions to the department outside the classroom.

**Mathematics**

To be considered for honors in mathematics, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College’s general requirements for honors, must demonstrate excellence in the major.  Honors are determined by committee on a case-by-case basis. Majors are encouraged to discuss their eligibility for honors with their adviser before the spring semester of their senior year. The department applies the following criteria:

What did I learn from copying, pasting, reading, and reflecting on
all of those?

* Some departments, such as English, History, and Religious Studies, set 
  higher gpa requirements.
* Some departments, such as Theatre and Dance, require a MAP or independent
  project.
* Some departments, such as Biology and Philosophy, require both an 
  independent research project and a public presentation of that project.
  I'm surprised to see that there's no requirment that the research
  and presentation be of high quality.  Perhaps that's implicit.  I
  see that Anthropology makes it explicit.
* Only a few departments list explicit criteria.  How many?
* Some departments, such as GWSS and Studio Art, require students to
  explicitly submit an application for honors, including some additional
  documentation.  I like that idea.

It's the end of February.  Unsurprisingly, this month felt shorter than
most months.  It's time to write my end-of-month musing.  I'll admit
that I sometimes find myself challenged to write this initial paragraph,
since I've written similar paragraphs before [1,2].

On my writing
-------------

Struggled to write on many days.  More precisely, struggled to finish 
writing.  I'd start a piece, become dissatisfied, and stop.  Perhaps it's 
that I was already writing for Ralph's class.  Perhaps it that I can't
write in multiple styles during the same time period.  Perhaps I'm learning
to become too critical.  But those days were hard.

Harley's comment: In attempt to make your writing better, let's
hope you don't lose what makes your writing good.  You have a voice.
Keep it.

Other issues
------------

Missed an opportunity.  Musing 1010 could have been about the former
celebration of the first paycheck, or someone's birthday, or Ultimate,
or something like that.  But [I've mused about that celebration
before](ten-ten).  It's not clear I needed to write anything more.


Data

What does my sketchbook look like?

* I have N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need minor revisions"
* I have another N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need major
  revisions".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Short".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Long".  

Looking ahead

[1] Yes, Ralph, I know.  I could structure this musing differently.

[2] That's a good topic for a musing: "How do I introduce my
end-of-month musings?"  I'll add it to the list.

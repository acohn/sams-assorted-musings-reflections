It's the end of February.  Unsurprisingly, this month felt shorter than
most months.  It's time to write my end-of-month musing.  I'll admit
that I sometimes find myself challenged to write this initial paragraph,
since I've written similar paragraphs before [1,2].

What does my sketchbook look like?

* I have N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need minor revisions"
* I have another N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need major
  revisions".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Short".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Long".

[1] Yes, Ralph, I know.  I could structure this musing differently.

[2] That's a good topic for a musing: "How do I introduce my
end-of-month musings?"  I'll add it to the list.

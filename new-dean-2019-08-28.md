Our new Dean
============

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), Academia*

Today marked the first Faculty Meeting of the 2019-2020 academic year.
If I count correctly, it's my twenty-third first Faculty Meeting of
the year.  I still recall [Grant Gale](grant-gale) standing up at my
first first Faculty Meeting and saying something like "This is my 50th
first Faculty Meeting".  Doug Caulkins wasn't there today, but I think
he could have said the same this year.

The meeting was filled with the normal highlights: The new faculty were
announced [1] and applauded [2].  The President discussed some large
strategic goals for the year (the Capital Campaign and the building
program are the ones I recall).  The Centers announced their programs [3].

One thing was different this year: We have a new Dean, Anne Harris,
who introduced herself and gave her vision for liberal arts education
and for Grinnell.  I've only had a few interactions with Dean Harris
so far [4], so I appreciated the opportunity to hear more from her.
Her speech suggested to me that we are lucky to have found her.
She's clearly thoughtful, articulate, funny, and collaborative [5].

She chose two interesting quotations to open her vision statement and
provided commentary and interpretation of each.  The first was from John
Dewey, approximately, "Democracy is reborn with each generation and
education is its midwife."  The second was much more recent and took the
form "Education is the new civil rights movement".  I appreciated even
more that she found ways to incorporate critical thinking, inclusion,
and policy change in her discussions of those quotations.

Dean Harris is an art historian and a medievalist; she found a variety
of ways to bring those aspects of her worldview into the presentation.
I particularly enjoyed her careful use of a painting of the Tower
of Babel by Peter Bruegel the Elder [6] and the careful ways she brought
different parts of the piece into her talk.

I also found it useful to hear  her discuss of the books she'd
been reading with faculty and staff since coming to
Grinnell.  I'm not sure that I was able to record the
whole list, but they include Kathleen Fitzpatrick's [_Generous
Thinking_](https://smile.amazon.com/Generous-Thinking-Radical-Approach-University/dp/1421429462/),
Cristina Henriquez' [_The Book of Unknown
Americans_](https://smile.amazon.com/Book-Americans-Cristina-Henr%C3%ADquez/dp/0345806409/)
[7], John Palfrey's [_Safe Spaces, Brave
Spaces_](https://smile.amazon.com/Safe-Spaces-Brave-Diversity-Expression/dp/0262535963/),
and the second edition of Terrell
L. Strayhorn's [_College Students' Sense of
Belonging_](https://smile.amazon.com/College-Students-Sense-Belonging-Educational-dp-1138238554/dp/1138238554/).
She also mentioned two followups to the last two
books; I think she's either started or planning
on reading both.  Those are Michael Roth's [_Safe Enough
Spaces_](https://smile.amazon.com/Safe-Enough-Spaces-Pragmatists-Correctness/dp/0300234856/)
and David Kirp's [_The College Dropout
Scandal_](https://smile.amazon.com/College-Dropout-Scandal-David-Kirp/dp/0190862211/).  I've added a few of these to my reading list.

It's useful to hear what books are currently shaping the Dean's
thinking about higher education and to hear her takes on these
books.  I wonder if she'll also be reading other books that faculty and
staff are discussing, including Anthony Abraham Jack's [_The Privileged
Poor_](https://smile.amazon.com/Privileged-Poor-Colleges-Disadvantaged-Students/dp/0674976894/)
and Kate Mann's [_Down
Girl_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0190604980/).

I'm not going to attempt to replicate her whole speech [9].  The
quotations, the painting, and the book discussion were highlights
for me.  However, I think my favorite part was a comment she made
in discussing her background, which I recall as being something like
the following:

> Seventeen years in a non-self-evident field made me an advocate for
knowledge and process that are not easily explained but are nonetheless
transformative.

I hope that perspective will be incorporated into whatever we end up
doing for assessment at the College.  I continue to worry about our
attempts to measure important things that are not naturally measurable.

In any case, it was a wonderful opening statement.  As I said, I
appreciate many parts of it, and I particularly appreciate her enthusiasm
for being a part of this wonderful institution.  I look forward to seeing
how Grinnell evolves under Dean Harris' watch.

Postscript: This musing contains more reporting and less reflection than
normal.  Or at least I think it does.    Oh well, that's how it goes 
sometimes.

Postscript: I went to campus ready to rant about a variety of things
(not to the Dean; just here).  I'm frustrated about the _Faculty 
Handbook_, about our new computer use policies, and about
[pioneers.grinnell.edu](pioneers-dot-grinnell-dot-ads).  So it was
nice to have a faculty meeting that put me in a good mood.

[1] For some reason, we did not get a list.  I always find it easier to
follow along when there's a list.

[2] We generally hold our applause until the end.  However, there were 
a few folks who had completed their Ph.D. (or equivalent) and the Dean's
office records were not up to date, so after the Dean read "Ph.D. in
progress", the new colleague would say "completed" and we'd all applaud.
I love that part of these meetings.  We've all been through it, so the
applause is sincere.

[3] This year, the announcements were only in the distributed materials.

[4] All positive.

[5] This last characteristic is harder to measure from a speech. Still,
her attitude was clearly one of collaboration.

[6] For the art historians among you, it's the version normally referred
to as "The Great Tower of Babel".  Bruegel also painted two other
versions, one of which appears to be lost.

[7] _The Book of Unknown Americans_ is also Grinnell's common reading
for this year [8].  

[8] Have I mused about the common reading yet?  I should.

[9] Although I have asked her for a copy.

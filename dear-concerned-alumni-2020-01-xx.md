Dear Concerned Alumni,

Congratulations!  As you can tell from [the latest Honor Roll of
Giving](https://alumni.grinnell.edu/giving-to-grinnell/impact-2019-honor-roll),
the College is no longer receiving donations from the Brownell
family.  It appears that your efforts have had the intended impact.

As you know, I do not agree with your assessment of the Brownell
family.  Nonetheless, I do understand your desire for Grinnell to
limit donations from those who do not subscribe to Grinnell's values.
For example, were Grinnell tempted to follow MIT's lead with regards
to [continued relationships with organizations that bring murderers
to
campus](https://www.wbur.org/edify/2018/12/06/mit-khashoggi-mohammed-bin-salman),
I would also be protesting loudly.

But that's not the point of this note.  Rather, I'd like to write about
Project Ignite.  As I expect you know, since it was one of the criticisms
raised, the Brownell's donation supported Project Ignite, an outreach
program intended to give educational enrichment to area children.  I've
heard that enrichment programs, or the lack thereof, are one of the things
that are contributing to the increased educational divide in our country.
Parents with a certain amount of wealth, or in certain areas, have access
to these programs.  Others do not.  I know from my own experience that poor 
and middle-class families in the middle of Iowa do not have easy access.
I'm proud that President Kington and the College found a way to provide
enrichment to our community and I'm proud of the various outreach and
enrichment activities the College continues to support and provide.

The students I know who have participated in Project Ignite have told
me that they found it valuable.  Not only did they have the opportunity
to serve our community in an important way, but they also had the joy of
interacting with children and, in many cases, they learned something in
developing activities for those children.

As I understand it, with the loss of the Brownell's donations, the
College has no direct funding for Project Ignite.  In my informal
conversations with folks in our Community Outreach program, I've
learned that we have found temporary ways to continue to fund the
program.  However, I must assume that that money comes from somewhere
else, presumably from other outreach programs.

Hence, I have a request for you.  Since the College no longer receives
Brownell money to support Project Ignite, would you please donate to fund
the program.  I know that children and parents in our community would
very much appreciate it.

With kind regards,

Sam Rebelsky

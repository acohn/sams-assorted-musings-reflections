Software over-privileges
========================

*Topics/tags [Miscellaneous](index-misc)*

The other day, I was putting together an advertisement for
[LACAFI](http://web.grinnell.edu/science/lacafi), the Liberal Arts College
Association for Faculty Inclusion [1].  I realized that I should probably
use the LACAFI logo and asked our academic support staff for a copy.  They
sent me an Adobe Illustator file.  Amazingly, I have Illustator on my
laptop.  But it's an old version [2] that I haven't used in a while.  And
it turns out that one needs Java 6 to use that version of Illustrator.
I didn't really want to re-install an old verson of Java, so I looked
into buying a new copy of Illustrator.

Now, I know that Illustator is expensive.  I recall spending a few hundred
dollars on Adobe Creative Suite the last time I purchased it.
I didn't want to spend that much on it.  But I also remembered
hearing that the College had a special partnership that gave
us a discounted price.  So I asked about it got a link to
[grinnell.onthehub.com](https://grinnell.onthehub.com/).

Here's what I discovered: Grinnell faculty and staff can purchase a
one-year subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud [3] for $9.75.  That's an
amazingly good price.  What's the normal price?  It appears to be $52.99
per month for normal people and $19.99 per month for students and teachers
[5].  So the price I pay is about four percent of the already-discounted
education price.

Once again, I'm reminded how many privileges are associated with my position.

Fortunately, others can share in this particular privilege.  I'd encourage
other faculty and staff to take advantage of this discount; $9.75 for
a year of access to Adobe products is a great deal [6].

Postscript: As you've figured out, the title of this musing is a failed
attempt to combine my sense of being over-privileged with the concepts
of "software privileges", which means something completely different.  I
will admit that I haven't really addressed the issue of software privileges,
but they are implicit in the concept of software licensing, rather than
software ownership or, better yet, available source code.

[1] Grinnell is a bronze-level sponsor of the ACM Richard Tapia
Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference.  As bronze-level
sponsors, we get to put in an advertisement.  I think we are all more
succesful in attracting candidates if we work together to describe the
benefits of teaching at a liberal arts college.  So whenever I can 
bring in others to collaborate, I do.

[2] CS 6

[3] More precisely, Adobe Creative Cloud for ETLA [4].

[4] Do you know what ETLA stands for?  I didn't.  There's one meaning
that I particularly appreciate: "Extended Three-Letter Acronym".  In
this case, I think it stands for "Enterprise Term Licensing Agreement".

[5] Hmmm ... the fine print suggests that it's $29.99 per month after
the first year.

[6] I'll muse at some other time about the problematic issues associated 
with software licensing.

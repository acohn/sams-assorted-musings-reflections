I had thought the [Union of Grinnell Student Dining
Workers](https://www.ugsdw.org/) was the only union of undergraduate
students in the U.S.  But I may be wrong.  UAW 2865 represents 
undergraduate tutors, readers, and TAs at the University
of California.  There's also SLEU, the Student Library Employee
Union at the University of Chicago [2].  Of course, both of these
unions also include graduate students.  I'm pretty sure that UAW
2865 has a large number of graduate students since it represents
both graduate students and undergrads, but SLEU is dominated by
undergrads.  Perhaps UGSDW is the only undergraduate-only, unaffiliated
union of undergraduate student workers.

Undergraduate workers in UAW 2865 at UC Berkeley have recently made
the news.  In particular, the student TAs in CS at Berkeley just
won a major victory.  I first learned about it when a friend pointed
me to [a Twitter feed about the
issue](https://twitter.com/BerkeleyUAW2865/status/1217161691407847424). UAW
2865 also posted [a press release about the
matter](http://uaw2865.org/cal-tas-win-multi-million-dollar-grievance-victory/).
I was hoping to scoop the academic newspapers and get a musing on
the topic out before their articles appeared, but yesterday was too
busy.  [_Inside Higher Ed_]() released [an article on the
victory](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/01/16/arbitrator-says-uc-berkeley-owes-its-computer-science-tas-5-million)
this morning [3].

Here's the backstory, as I understand it.  

UAW 2865 and the UCs have an agreement by which any students who
work as tutors, TAs, and the like for at least ten hours per week
receive benefits, including tuition remission and, perhaps some
health care.  I don't know how they settled on ten hours.  I thought
most institutions used twenty as the cut-off for benefits.  But
that's the rule.

Berkeley CS, like most CS programs nationwide, has experienced explosive
growth.  Dan Garcia's work with AP CS Principles and his incredible
teaching in the non-majors intro have probably contributed, too.  Berkeley,
like most large institutions, uses a course model that involves large
lectures and much smaller recitation sections.  Because there aren't enough
graduate students to teach those recitation sections, Berkeley has
experienced undergrads run them with supervision from one of the teaching
faculty.  (Remember, this is my understanding.  It may not be correct.)
To keep sections small while maintaining a reasonable budget, the department
chose the hack of designating most of the section-leader positions as
eight-hour-per-week positions.  There are some positions, like senior
undergraduate TA, that they designate as over ten hours, and which thereby
confer benefits.

This all happens in the Bay Area, where costs of living are insanely
high.  So the undergrad TAs make about $30/hour, whether or not they
work enough hours for benefits.  The _Inside Higher Ed_ piece notes
that

> Information that the department shared at a town hall around 2016
show[s] that undergraduate TAs on eight-hour appointments cost $4,000
per term, while 10-hour appointees cost $11,000.

I'm pretty sure that $4,000 per course is [more than many adjuncts
in the humanities with Ph.D.'s
make](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Adjunct-Project-Shows-Wide/136439).

As you might guess, the union was not happy with the hack, sued, and
won.  Berkeley is now responsible for retroactively providing 
tuition reimbursements for a bunch of student TAs from the past three
years or so.  The total cost will be about $5 million.  I expect that,
in the future, Berkeley CS will have somewhere between one-half and
one-third as many undergraduate TAs, which means that their sections
will be significantly larger.  Or perhaps someone will come up with a
way to bump the budget.

I'm trying to figure out how I feel about all of this.  I feel bad
for the students in the classes, who will likely get a less good
education in CS or who may get cut out of the department altogether.
But what about the underlying issues?  On the one hand, the students
who accepted the eight-hour assignments knew what they were getting
into and decided that the benefits of the position [4] were appropriate
compensation.  On the other, unions and contracts with unions exist
for a reason, and undermining those contracts is not appropriate.
It may also be that students who might have benefited from taking
those positions chose not to accept them because they needed the
tuition remission benefit that came from another position [5].

In the end, the institution negotiated a contract in which a
ten-hour-per-week position comes with benefits and it's clear that
the TA positions should have been designated as ten-hour-per-week
positions.  It sucks that it giving TAs the agreed-upon benefits
will have a significant impact on the education of other students,
but that's not the union's fault [6].

What does this tell me about Grinnell's union?  I know that we no
longer have a case pending before the NLRB, so I'm likely no longer
restricted in what I can say about the union and its expansion.
Nonetheless, I'd prefer not to write direct comments for or against
the union.  Instead, I'll just comment on our mentor, tutor, and
grader positions.  I've said for some time that they require special
skills and that at other institutions, these kinds of positions
earn high pay.  I know it would also affect budgets at Grinnell,
but I'd like to see our positions pay better, at least as much as
the dining services worker positions [7].

Postscript: I apologize to my friends and colleagues at Berkeley
if I have misrepresented any of these issues or if my reflections
on the situation seem inappropriate.  And you have my sympathy for
having to deal with what sounds like incredibly difficult issues.

[1] When I write "Student Unions", I mean organizations of student workers,
not the buildings at the center of many campuses.

[2] SLEU [just won a case to allow themselves to form](https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/12/29/university-loses-library-union-case-nlrb-affirms-c/).

[3] I have no idea why they call this "Berkeley's $5M Glitch".  It doesn't
seem like much of a glitch to me.

[4] Not just the pay, but also the experience of teaching.

[5] I have the same issue with the higher pay we give to dining services
workers since that pay differential encourages students to work dining
services, rather than as a class mentor or research assistant, even 
though the latter positions would have more important long-term impacts.

[6] It is, unfortunately, one of those things that people tend to
hold against unions.

[7] I understand that supply-and-demand is also an issue, which suggests
that we should pay more for dining services positions, which are hard
to fill.  Certainly, that's what happens with lifeguarding.  Nonetheless,
positions that require specialized skills also deserve high compensation.
I guess that applies to lifeguarding, too.

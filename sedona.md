Sedona
======

I think a lot about software.  In part, that's because I'm a computer 
scientist.  But I'd probably think a lot about software no matter what
I do because I think about many of the things with which I interact.

From my perspective, good software does at least one of three things:

1. It makes a task "better" (more efficient, cheaper, easier, more fun).

2. It enables us to do something we could not do previously.

3. It provides us with access to data that we can use to better understand
[1].

Of course, good software should also be easy to use and accessible.

As an example of outcome #1, SMS provides a better alternative to phone
calls for some situations.  It's asyncronous.  It is accessible to
those who cannot hear [2].  It can be more fun, given that you can now
add emojis.  And it more explicitly provides a record of a conversation.

Software that achieves outcome #2 seems rarer.  I'll admit that I
struggled to come up with software that does not have some non-computer
equivalent, but most of the cases I came up with were just much less
efficient or much less scalable.  The software used to design computer
chips creates designs that could not be created by hand, at least not in
a reasonable number of time.  But it is possible to create chips without
that software.  In any case, you can probably come up with one on your
own, at least if you think a bit.

We see huge increases in software that achieves outcome #3.  Twitter
provides you with a record of things people across the country and
across the world are talking about.  Those data are time-stamped and
geo-located and more.  So you can trace everything from the spread of
slang to geographic differences in interests to diseases to ....

Great software not only does one or more of those things, it also
transforms the way we think about issues.  Spreadsheets, starting with
the legendary Visicalc, have transformed how people work with numeric
data, encouraging much more open exploration [3].  

And then there's Sedona.

For those of you who don't know about Sedona, Sedona is software designed
primarily to record the activities of faculty members.  If you mention
Sedona to any Grinnell faculty member, you will hear complaints and snorts
of derision.  Why?  Because it takes what should be a straightforward
task and makes it more complicated and more time consuming.  It embodies
a model of faculty activities unsuited to an institution like Grinnell.
I still recall when the designer of Sedona gave a workshop on using
Sedona on campus [5].  He said "And, of course, you should put an
entry in Sedona to indicate that you participated in this workshop."
Why would anyone think that was necessary?  Because Sedona comes from
the piece-worker, state-school model of higher education.

Why do I say that Sedona makes my life harder?  Let's see.  We'll start
with how I record my scholarship.  I have a BibTeX entry for each paper
that I can then automatically include in anything I write and my CV.
In fact, I can download such an entry for almost any paper I write,
since my professional organization provides such entries for anything in
their digital library.  I can also download something preformatted in a
reasonable bibliogrpahy style.  How do I get my paper into Sedona?  I log
in to Sedona.  I click on the appropriate "Research Activities Entry", say
"Articles in Proceedings", which is my most typical form of publication.
I click on the "Add" button.  And then I have to manually enter all
of the data.  Can I just copy and paste from an existing format?  Nope.
Can I have our ASA do the work for me?  Well, it seems like a waste of her
time, and it turns out that she can't even answer all of the questions
without consulting with me.  For example, she won't know what to answer
for Research Type (DBS, CTP, LPS, or NIC, in case you were wondering)
or Scope (International, National, Regional, State, Local, or Unknown).
So, what should be a one-minute task in most cases ends up being a 
fifteen-minute or more task, particularly when you are someone like me
who has large numbers of student co-authors.

How about service?  You'd think that would be easy.  But there are 
always extra questions.  Let's see ... let's consider my service as
a member of the Vivero Advisory Board [6], one of the four or
so advisory boards I serve on at the College.  First I have to select
the type of activity.  Here are my options.

> 
Assurance of Learning - Institional Service [9];
Committee Chair [10];
Committee Members;
Concentration Chair;
Contributions to Diversity [11];
Department Chair;
Faculty Advisor;
Faculty Sponsor;
Faculty Workshop Facilitator;
Faculty Workshop Participant [12];
Mentoring Activities;
Other Institutional Service Activities [14];
Panelist - non academic conference [15];
Student placements [16];
Thesis / Disseration - Chair;
Thesis / Dissertation - Co-Chair;
Webinar participant/leader [18]; or
Writing Student Recommendations [19].

Isn't that a great set of options?  Is an Advisory Board the same as a
Committee?  I guess it's the closest thing we have.  So that's pretty
easy.

But now let's consider my role with Grinnell Women in Computing (WinC).
It's a contribution to diversity.  I serve as faculty advisor and faculty
sponsor to the group.  I mentor students through WinC.  Which should
I list it as [20]? 

More importantly, does anyone really care?  You shouldn't be asking for
information that you don't use.

Oh well, back to entering the Vivero Advisory Board.  What's next?  Oh,
I get to enter the "Committee or Service or Graduate Student Name".  What
a fascinating set of options.  I type "Vivero Advisory Board".  I count
myself lucky that it's not another "Select one" field.

Next, I get to enter the University at whch the service was performed.
I performed it at Grinnell, which isn't a University.  But, hey,
who cares about precision in language?  It's not like we teach our
students that words make a difference.  I choose "GrinnelL College".
My other options are "Dartmouth College" [21] and "--Unassigned--".
Fascinating, isn't it?  Then I can enter the year.  I have a choice of
Academic Year or Calendar Year.  I guess that's friendly.  Since I'm
continuing on the board, I select 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.  We've finally
hit one useful thing about Seonda!  I don't have to re-enter service.
I just get to click another line.

What's next?  "Scope Codes".  Is it Department or College or University
or State-wide or Dissertation or Thesis?  Wait?  Didn't they just tell
me that a College is the same as a University?  How do I distinguish
the two here?  Is there any guidance?  Of course not.  I'll just choose
"College".

I'm nearing the end.  It asks for "# of Days".  Do you know what that
means?  I'm assuming it's the amount of service I did on that committee.
If I recall correctly, I spent about eight hours on Vivero between
meetings and email and such.  So I'll say 1.00 days.  Hmmm ... does that
show up on my Faculty Activity Report or my Salary Review template?  Nope.
The number of days doesn't show up.  That's useful [22].

[1] Some might say "conduct analytics" or "analyze".

[2] Those who cannot see might be able to use screen readers.

[3] And perhaps a bit more fudging [4].

[4] But they perhaps make it easier to find fudged data.

[5] The fact that we needed a workshop to use Sedona should have been
a warning sign.

[6] [Vivero](http://vivero.sites.grinnell.edu/) is an [Innovation
Fund](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/president/innovationfund) [7] project in which students learn Digital Humanities [8] techniques
so that they can support faculty as they incorporate such

[7] The Innovation Fund is a special Presidential fund at the College
that supports a variety of experimental projects.  It's supported a wide
variety of interesting and valuable activities at the College, including a
virtual choir, some planning for a campus Makespace, the Wellness lounge
(I think), leadership training, external reviewers for MAP projects,
the construction of digital archives from College historical materials,
and some half-decent code camps.

[8] Well, really Digital Liberal Arts, but who can tell the difference?

[9] Nope, I have no idea what that means.

[10] Yup, I know what that means.

[11] I'm glad that we value contributions to diversity.

[12] I'm not sure that I understand why participating in a workshop
is a service activity.  I've clearly left lots of my "service" off
of my Sedona list.  It may be time to spend a day updating my
Sedona records.

[14] Shouldn't "Other" be last?

[15] Interestingly, there is no "Panelist - academic conference".

[16] I keep forgetting that that's there.  I wonder how I enter my
work a placement coordinator for Mathematics, Statistics, and
Computer Science [17]?

[17] It appears that I do list my activity as "Student placements".

[18] Why are we not distinguishing participant from leader when we're
online?  Who knows.

[19] I have never listed my recommendations.  This may be the first
time I've realized that it's a separate entry on the form.

[20] As I look back at my Sedona entries, I see that I chose
"Contributions to Diversity".

[21] Dartmouth College is arguably a University because they award
graduate degrees in some fields.  Grinell College is not, since it 
does not award any non-honorary graduate degrees.

[22] Sarcasm doesn't show up in text, does it?

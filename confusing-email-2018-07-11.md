Getting confused by email notifications
=======================================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email), absentminded professors*

Recently, I was having trouble with my "new" laptop [1] and needed to
switch back to my old laptop.  Switching to my old laptop means running
Mail.app on the old laptop for the first time in a few months, which
means waiting a bit for the mail to update [2].  I never quite understand
the order in which it loads the "new" email.  It's not newest-to-oldest;
it's not oldest-to-newest.

I don't know your experience with Mail.app on a Mac, but when I use it,
I get notifications of some new messages when they arrive.  When I'm using
Mail.app actively, that can be helpful.  Often, I can answer new messages
quickly, or at least decide at a glance whether they are something that
I need to address immediately [3].

While I was working during the update, a message from my chair popped up.
As is the norm for messages from the chair, I read it and responded.  But
I wasn't thinking about the fact that my email was updating and therefore
didn't check the date on the message.  I assumed it had just arrived.

The message was about the predicted enrollments in spring.  We had
asked every CS student to enter their expected spring courses in
WebAdvisor/SelfService [4].  The Registrar's office can run scripts
to gather the data and tell us about potential issues, such as 48
students planning to enroll in a 24-person class in the spring [5].

If I recall correctly, the message indicated that not every major had
entered their information and it encouraged us to chat with our advisees
about some of the pressure points for spring.

As you might expect, I dutifully went through the schedules of the 39
CS advisees I currently have [6].  Only two had not entered their spring
2019 courses and I could figure out what those were.  I also noted some
other things that might be of interest.  And I recorded the info on all
of the students in a text file so that I could find it more easily next
time [7].

Then I started to reply to the message.  But I couldn't find it in
my recent messages.  So I searched.  Then I realized that Mail.app had
misled me.  It wasn't a new message from my chair.  It was an old message
from my chair, from a little more than a month ago.  I'm not sure why it
appeared on my screen.  I think it's that Mail.app noted that the message
was new to *that* computer, it probably has a log that says "That
Rebelsky fellow always reads messages from his chair immediately", and,
putting the two together, it decided, "Let's tell him about this important
message."  Since Mail.app only posts messages for new mail in the
inbox, I'm reminded once again of why I should strive to achieve and
maintain [inbox zero](inbox-zero-revisited-01).

Let's see ... 39 advisees; between two and five minutes per advisee,
depending on how much work I needed to do.  I spent around two hours on
what is essentially a meaningless task.  I should pay better attention
to the dates on messages.  Or maybe I shouldn't be on my computer when
I'm tired and not thinking clearly enough.  Oh well, at least I have
notes on what CS courses my advisees plan to take in the spring.

[1] In this case, "new" means that I bought it used about a year and a
half ago.  I think it's about five years old now.  My "old" laptop I
bought new about five years ago.  So they are of similar vintage.  The
"old" laptop has less memory (8 gb vs 16 gb) and a slightly slower
processor.  I notice the former more than the latter.

[2] For some reason, Mail.app seems to get very upset if I have two
copies running simultaneously on two different computers.

[3] Yes, there are the occasional messages that I should address immediately.

[4] Most of us refer to it as "WebAdvisor".  It's used for planning.
But when I talk to the folks in ITS who maintain the software,
they call it "SelfService".  And the URLs are all of the form
`https://selfservice.grinnell.edu/Student/Planning/Advisors/Advise/0123456`.

[5] In an ideal world, we would find an appropriate way to shift classes
around.  In a less ideal world, we suggest that some students switch to
open slots in the fall and warn others that they may have to wait until
the following year to take the course.

[6] 34 in the class of 2019; 5 in the class of 2020.

[7] For those who have not used SelfService, it takes about thirty
seconds to load a student record.  It also takes a long time to load
the list of advisees; I'm not sure how long because I got so fed up at
waiting that I found a way to bypass the list of advisees [8].

[8] Amazingly enough, SelfService URLs are well-formed and consistent.
That makes it easy to create bookmarks or links.  I have a Web page on
my laptop that has a link to each advisee.  And now it also has a note
about what they are doing in the spring.

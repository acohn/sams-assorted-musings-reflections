Designing a faculty/staff Friday on student persistence
=======================================================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia), things I had to write in any case*

For reasons I still don't understand, I was asked to put together a
Faculty Friday [1] about student persistence.  I ended up restructuring
the charge a bit, so that I am now putting together a group of people
who will put together a Faculty/Staff Friday about student persistence.
Still, I'm probably stuck taking the lead, so I thought I'd sketch out
an approximate possible structure for the meeting.

**Version One**

_Short introduction_.

Share motivational data. Our latest data are from 2018.  Only 78% of the class of 2018 (starting in Fall 2014) graduated from Grinnell in four years or less.  Only 84% of the class of 2016 (starting in Fall 2012) graduated from Grinnell in six years or less.  While those are better than national averages, as Dean Harris suggested, they indicate that we are not serving our students well.

Short table discussion + share. What factors do you think led/lead to this low graduation rates?

Share data: Here's what we've learned from exit interviews and other studies about likely factors in students choosing to leave Grinnell or to fail to graduate in a timely fashion.

Short table discussion + share: Many students face similar issues and still persist at Grinnell.  What kinds of factors help students persist?

Share data: Here's what we've learned.

Share recommendations from the task forces and the studies.

Short table discussion: What are practices you can incorporate in your own work at the College?  Where can/should the College invest resources?

[1] Faculty Friday is a structure initiated by Dean Latham.  The
idea is that Faculty members get together for lunch on Fridays to
talk about issues that might be of interest to or relevant to them.
Faculty Friday was one of the many activities that the Dean's office
than shifted to the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment.

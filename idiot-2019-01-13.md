I'm an idiot
============

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

Yesterday, I drove to the annual high school swim invite at South-East
Polk high school [1].  We had fresh snow, and the highways were slick.
But we made it with time to spare.

When I got there and started to park, I said to myself, "It's much better
to be facing forward out of a space" and decided to plow over the hump
of snow at the end of the space.  Unfortunately, the hump of snow 
obscured one of those short concrete barriers they use to mark the 
ends of spaces and I went right over [2].  Of course, the hump put my
car high enough that, with the snow, I did not have enough traction
to back up over it.

Did I mention that I'm an idiot?

Fortunately, Eldest Son was with me and was able to help push it back
over the barrier.  But, boy, do I feel stupid.

[1] Their team is the Rams.  My traditional dad joke is that they should
call the team the Tics.

[2] My family thinks that I should have remembered that they had 
barriers

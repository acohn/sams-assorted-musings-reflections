Looking ahead to summer 2019
============================

*Topics/tags: [Overcommitment](index-overcommitment), short, rambly*

Today, I was updating my [curriculum
vitae](https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/CV/rebelsky-cv-full.pdf),
or CV [1].  Once you reach my age, one of the nice things about a CV is
that it helps you remember things you've done or how many times you've
done something.  I know mine is incomplete [2,3,4], but it's complete
enough to help remind me of many things I've done.

One of the things I looked at today was the section in which I list
students who worked with me on summer research projects or independent
studies.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I list the projects they worked
on; my understanding is that FERPA does not permit me to include their
names except in the cases in which I am describing shared publications
or presentations.  I wish I could list names; it would help me remember
better.  In any case, I was looking at that section [5].  The entries
remind me that I do most of my more intense work with students in the
summer.  That makes sense; my semesters are generally busy with classes
and service.

Then I started looking for the gaps.  I realized that, even though I was
a bit better at taking time away from students earlier in my career, I
haven't taken very many summers off since I started at Grinnell.  As far
as I can tell, I've worked with students eighteen of the twenty-one
summers I've been at Grinnell [6].  Well, maybe it's nineteen [7].
Perhaps it's not surprising that I've accumulated MAP releases that I
need to use up.

As importantly, I realized that I have supervised students every summer
since summer 2011, including that summer.  That's eight summers in a row.
Some summers likely represented a reasonable workload.  Others, like
the past three summers of code camps, required more than full-time work
and took a lot out of me.  I certainly enjoy working with students.
I primarily do summer work with students to give opportunities to
students.  At times, working with students also helps keep me focused.
Nonetheless, this coming summer, I need time to myself, for both work
and recuperation.

[1] "Record of Life", as I understand it.

[2] It is also probably not entirely up to date.

[3] It certainly needs some more spell-checking and other editing.

[4] It also needs some typographic work; I have at least two cases in
which a heading appears on a separate page from the associated
content.  I also have a bunch of overfull hboxes (or too-long lines,
in normal human terms).

[5] Page 12, for those who want to take a look.

[6] I did not take MAP or MIP students in the summers of 2005, 2008,
and 2010.

[7] I just checked my notes.  I did have two students in the summer of
2010 working as funded assistants, rather than as MAP or MIP students.
But I traveled a lot that summer.  If I recall correctly, I generally left
those students on their own to learn Drupal and, if I recall correctly,
to try to build a Plans-like system.  I would think that working with
less supervision was not the best of experiences, but at least one of
the two students told me that it proved invaluable for getting a job.
And both have certainly been successful.  Of course, they were awesome
people, so it's not surprising that they have been successful.  In 
any case, I'm not sure whether or not I should count myself as having
students that summer.

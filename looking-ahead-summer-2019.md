Looking ahead to summer 2019
============================

*Topics/tags: [Overcommitment](index-overcommitment), short, rambly*

Today, I was updating my [curriculum
vitae](https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/CV/rebelsky-cv-full.pdf),
or CV [1].  Once you reach my age, one of the nice things about a CV is
that it helps you remember things you've done or how many times you've
done something.  I know mine is incomplete [2,3,4], but it's complete
enough to serve as a reminder for many things.

One of the things I reviewed today was the section in which I list
students who worked with me on summer research projects or independent
studies.  Well, that's not quite true.  I list the projects they worked
on; my understanding is that FERPA does not permit me to list their names
except along with shared publications or presentations.  I wish I could
list names; it would help me remember better.  Nonetheless, I was looking
at that section [5].  It's clear that I do most of my more intense work 
with students in the summer.  That makes sense; my semesters are generally
fairly busy with classes and sevice.

Then I started looking for the gaps.  I realized that, even though I was
a bit better at taking time away from students earlier in my career,
I haven't taken many summers off.  As far as I can tell, I've worked
with students every summer I've been at Grinnell except for three (2005,
2008, and 2010).  Perhaps it's not surprising that I've accumulated MAP
credits that I need to use up.

As importantly, I've had students every summer since summer 2011,
including that summer.  That's eight summers in a row.  I think some
summers represented a reasonable workload.  Others, like the past three
summers of code camps, were beyond full-time and took a lot out of me.
I certainly enjoy working with students.  At times, working with students
also helps keep me focused.  However, I generally do summer work with
students to give opportunities to students.  It's clear that this coming
summer, I need time to myself, both for work and recuperation.

[1] "Record of Life", as I understand it.

[2] It is also probably not completely up to date.

[3] It certainly needs some more spell-checking and other editing.

[4] It also needs some typographic work; I have at least one annoying
typographic widow and a bunch of slightly too long lines.

Eleven months of daily musings
==============================

I have now completed eleven months of daily musings [1,2].  At the end
of each month, I like to step back and reflect upon what I've learned,
or have not learned, in the month of writing.  Early on, I found myself
reflecting on what I had learned about writing and about how my writing
was changing.  At this point, I find that my writing style has reached a
somewhat fixed point.  I don't seem to be evolving much as a writer. Is
that okay?  I'm still not sure.  I'd like to become a better writer.
But I also enjoy writing for the sake of writing.

This past month I've had difficulty keeping up with daily essays.
In part, it was that I was out of town and busy for ten days.  But I
also have a very different rhythm to my life in the summer.  I work as
much during the day, but I don't tend to work at night.  So, while the
daily musing was a good way to break from work in the evening, it seems
like a less good way to break from whatever I"m doing most evenings
(reading books, playing with my family, watching silly TV series with
my family, whatever).  

Nonetheless, I consider it important to write daily.  So I really do
need to find a way to incorporate these musings in my daily routine.
I also have a fairly large backlog of things to muse about.  Perhaps I'll
write them in the morning, rather than at night.  Perhaps I'll find a
time during the day that I want to take a break.  We'll see.

But I've missed a lot of musings this past month [3].  Perhaps I'll
try doing two musings per day until I catch up.  Or perhaps not.

What will I muse about this month?  Each month, I say that I should
write more profiles.  Perhaps I will find a way to do so this month.  
I also need to write the daily readings and labs for CSC 151.  Will
the drafts of those make good musings?  We will see.  There are also
a few series that I should continue, including notes on my tastes
in music and comments on CS principles.  I've also promised to start
a series on summer code camps.

As I say each month, stay tuned!

[1] Well, eleven months and a few days, since I'm posting this late.

[2] More precisely, it's difficult to say exactly how many months of
daily musings I've written.  But I'm counting the end of each month
starting with September 1, 2016.  So August 31, 2017 will be one year.

[3] I posted sixteen musings in June.  That means that I'm fourteen
musings behind.

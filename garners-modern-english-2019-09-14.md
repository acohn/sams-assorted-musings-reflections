Those wacky Rebelskys
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), language, short*

For about as long as I can remember, my kids have said that their
friends are sometimes intimidated by visiting the Rebelsky household,
at least at dinner time.  Our dinner conversations tend to veer
wildly between topics, including topics that only some of us
comprehend well.  For example, when Youngest and I talk about
computing, the others do their best to follow; when Middle talks
about his work in Chemistry, Youngest and I have trouble following;
when Youngest and Middle talk about music, Eldest generally follows
and Michelle and I try.  When Youngest and Eldest discuss Math, the
rest of us just nod our heads.  But I think the scary part is when
we have something we all know about [1].  I was reminded of that
yesterday.

Youngest decided to purchase the electronic version of _Garner's
Modern English Usage_ [2].  He already had the hardcover, but you
never know when you might need to look up a subtlety.  One enjoyable
aspect of the electronic version is that it includes a series of
multiple-choice quizzes about grammar.  Do you write, "He beseeched
her to marry him" or "He besought her to marry him" [3,4,5]? Should
you ask, "Is either of them sufficient?" or "Are either of them
sufficient?" [6].

Middle discovered the quizzes while we were driving in the car
yesterday.  As they took some of the quizzes, we all [7] piped in
with opinions and commentary.  Youngest helped explain Garner's
five stages of verbal change [8].  I'm surprised that we did not
get into a debate as to whether Garner is a descriptivist;
he seems to have clear preferences, even in cases when multiple
spellings or forms are used [11,14].  We also had some fun realizing
some of the things we get wrong.  It never occurred to me that the
phrase I think of as "for all intensive purposes" is really "for
all intents and purposes" [15].  But it certainly makes sense.

Of course, we're Rebelskys.  We don't always agree, with each other
or with authorities [16].  what was the latest challenge?  Oh, yeah.
How should one pronounce "ophthalmologist"?

[1] Or maybe it's the puns.

[2] It used to be _Garner's Modern American Usage_, or some such.  I
assume that the introduction explains the renaming, but I have not read
it yet.

[3] I would be unlikely to write either of those statements; I
suppose the real question is which one should write.

[4] Garner tells us to use "besought", noting both that the OED indicates
that "beseeched" is "now regarded as incorrect" and that besought appears
about five times as frequently as beseeched.

[5] I was amused to discover that Grammarly is happy with "beseeched"
but not "besought".  And no, Grammarly, I don't mean "brought".

[6] And how should I have punctuated that sentence?

[7] Well, all but Eldest.  Eldest now lives far away.

[8] I don't recall them.  But I did find a description in the essay
entitled "The Ongoing Tumult in English Usage" [9]

> Stage 1: A new form emerges as an innovation (or a dialectal 
form persists) among a small minority of the language community,
perhaps displacing a traditional usage.

> Stage 2: The form spreads to a significant fraction of the language
community, but remains unacceptable in standard usage.

> Stage 3: The form becomes commonplace even among many well-educated
people but is still avoided in careful usage.

> Stage 4: The form becomes virtually universal but is opposed on cogent 
grounds by a few linguistic stalwarts (die-hard snoots [10]).

> Stage 5: The form is universally accepted (not counting pseudo-snoot
eccentrics).

[9] There's probably some sensible way to cite the essay.  At the
moment, it escapes me.  I found the essay in an app called _GMEUApp_.
The description available as a guide in the same app provides similar
information.

[10] "Snoot" is a term that David Foster Wallace's family used to
describe people who care deeply about language.

[11] I am unhappy to see that he prefers "adviser" to "advisor",
even though he acknowledges that the latter spelling is almost as
frequent [12].  At least he doesn't mark "advisor" with the dreaded
asterisk, which indicates that it's a form to be avoided.

[12] Surprisingly, Grammarly prefers "advisor" to "adviser".

[14] Or maybe someone else wrote the quizzes.

[15] At least Grammarly gets this one right.

[16] Like Garner.

Opening convocation 2019-20
===========================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), Grinnell*

This past Thursday was the first [Scholars Convocation](convocation) of 
the 2019-2020 academic year.  I love Scholars Convocation: It's an
opportunity to learn new things and, as importantly, an opportunity
to build a common set of knowledge at Grinnell [1].  This year marks
the 40th anniversary of Convo.  In an ideal world, Convo would have
an appropriate place at the core of a Grinnell education, along
with the individually advised curriculum and the Tutorial.

Unfortunately, the world is far from ideal.  This week's Convocation
made me *furious*.  It's not the content; it was an interesting and
useful panel [2].  Rather, it's a combination of the attendance and
the marketing.  This was one of the worst attended Convocations I've
attended, and it's one that should have been one of the best attended.

Why should people have attended?  First of all, it had a wonderful
panel of thoughtful people from campus, including Autumn Wilke, our
Assistant Dean for Disability Resources; Fredo Rivera '06, Assistant
Professor of Art History; Karen Edwards, Director of International
Student Affairs; Gema Sala, Associate Professor of Political Science;
and Sharon Quinsaat, Assistant Professor of Sociology.  Plus, it was
moderated by the always amazing Vrinda Varia, Director of Intercultural
Affairs.  Each of these panelists is someone whose insight I regularly
appreciate [3].  Having them bounce ideas off of each other was 
particularly enlightening.

Second, the topic was something that should be of interest to everyone:
How one builds a sense of belonging and home.  (Also what may cause
lack of belonging.)  Particularly as we come together to a place that
was originally home for very few of us, it's useful to consider such
issues.

Third, this topic was grounded in this year's Common Reading: Cristina
Henríquez' _The Book of Unknown Americans_ [4].  The Common Reading is
another way that we can build a common intellectual heritage at 
Grinnell [5].  One would hope that the incoming students who have just
read the book---as well as the current students, faculty, and staff who
are reading it---would want to attend.

So why in hell were so few people there?

I expect that a variety of factors are at play.  Convocation
attendance seems to have dropped significantly in the past few
years.  In part, it's because Convocation was temporarily moved to
a less convenient time.  In part, it's because Convocation is no longer
a weekly event, which makes it harder to remember when/if we have
a Convocation.

As I said, advertising and marketing may also have come into play.
I don't recall seeing posters for this convocation around campus.
It wasn't in the [_Campus
Memo_](https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Campus-Memo---8-27-2019.html).
I'm not sure why Communications chose not to include one of the
most important all-campus events [6].  The title in the [Campus
Calendar](https://www.grinnell.edu/calendar/) is also a bit
off-putting: "NSO: First Year Scholars Convocation".  Both "NSO"
and "First Year" may make readers believe that it's only for
first-year students.  But Convocation is always open to all.
The NSO *should* have clued in first-year students and their advisors
that it was valuable to attend.  However, it seems not to have.

What can we do about this next year?  A mention at the first faculty
meeting of the year would be good.  A mention in the _Campus Memo_
would be good.  Posters would be good.  Perhaps we should
tell all Tutorial profs [7] that they are expected to bring their
Tutorials to the opening Convocation.  But, well, I'm not sure that
you can tell faculty anything.

I encourage all my readers to attend the four Convocations scheduled
for this semester: Ari Berman from _Mother Jones_ talking about The
Tyranny of Data on September 12, Joan Neuberger '75 on September 19 [8],
Kate Manne, author of _Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny_ [9,10] on 
September 26, and the aforementioned Cristina Henríquez on November 21.

I hear that George Drake '56 will be giving a quick opening at one
of those Convocations, presumably on September 12th or 19th.  Be
there!

Postscript: As I noted in [an early musing](profanity), I generally 
avoid profanity.  However, I felt this situation called for it.

[1] I asked George Drake '56, who I've been told is responsible for the
thing we now call Scholars Convocation.  He has verified that building
a common set of knowledge was, in fact, one of his primary goals in
creating Convo.

[2] More of that forthwith.

[3] I assume others do, too.

[4] Yes, it's on my reading list for this year.

[5] More on that in a future musing.  Or have I mused about that
issue already?  It's a complex issue, and I'm not likely to be
completely polite about it.

[6] Presumably because no one on the academic side told them to do so.

[7] I'd like to write "Tutors", but that's taken on another meeting.

[8] Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend that one.

[9] Also on my reading list.

[10] One could argue that a book subtitled "The Logic of Misogyny" should
be one of the shortest books published, because misogyny is, at heart,
illogical.  But what do I know?

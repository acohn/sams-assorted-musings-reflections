One decade
==========

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

Today is 20 July 2019.  My mother, Freda Rebelsky, passed away a decade
ago today, on 20 July 2009 [1].  It's hard to believe that a decade has 
passed.  It certainly doesn't feel like it.  I still miss her.  A lot.
A day rarely passes that I don't encounter something she would have
appreciated, most typically, something the kids have done or plan to
do.

I struggled to figure out what to write today.  I've already written
[a tribute, of sorts](mom).  I thought about writing about how she
might have reacted to the past decade of politics, from the actions 
and attitudes of the Trump administration [2] to the Obama administration's
betrayal of progressivism [3,4].  But I try to keep my musings
comparatively non-political [5,6].  I thought about writing about the
time near her death, perhaps going backward from Michelle answering
the phone in the middle of the night.  It would certainly be an
opportunity to vent my frustrations at the Mayflower [7].  But it would
just make me cry, and probably make me even angrier.

Then I recalled a text that I got from middle son a month or so ago.
It appears that he fell into one of those rabbit holes on the Interweb
and ended up discovering a quote from my mother in one of the chapters
in [_The Writer's Home Companion_](https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Home-Companion-Anthology-Writing/dp/0805048936/).  Let's see ...

> If we ask what is the most important way to cure the epidemic of
women's voicelessness, a possible answer is the one given by Eli
Newberger, a major advocate for children, who said, in response to the
question of how we can stop the epidemic of child abuse, "We must
dismantle the patriarchy."  Freda Rebelsky offers a provocative rejoinder:
"No, I think we need to mantle the matriarchy." [8]

But he didn't stop there; he'd found a variety of other things and sent
me links to some of them.  For example, he'd found [an interview with
her on WGBH](https://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip_15-32d7wxj5)
[9].  It was nice to listen to part of it, even though it's strange to
hear her voice from so long ago.  I'd forgotten that she was president
of the Massachusetts Children's Lobby.

Middle son also found [a video debate with her from
1974](http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/V_D61BE5FE7C7E47BCB950443F8B4A5D74#at_2061.539_s).
I had thought that Fox-TV-like "dialogue" was a comparatively recent
thing.  But in this debate from 45 years ago, mom is being attacked
for being elitist because she suggests that a liberal arts education
would make everybody a better citizen and because she does not consider
it necessary to connect college to employment.  It's fascinating to see
the way they twist her words to suggest that she thinks she's better
than working-class people.

My middle son also found references to a few of mom's poems, including
the one that inspired my musing about [busses and bussing](busses-bussing).

And maybe that's a good way to think about mom today: She was someone
who loved language, from her "provocative rejoinder" to her playing
with words in her "pro-bussing" poem.  And, of course, I'll always
remember my favorite "provocative rejoinder": When a _Time_ [9] reporter
was interviewing her about John Silber and said something like "But isn't
he a genius?", mom responded with "He may be, but so was Ezra Pound."

I miss you mom.

Postscript: I was able to get through some of the audio and some of the
video without breaking down.  Maybe I'll be okay going through some of
her videotapes and other things in the basement; I've put it off a long
time because it's been so hard to try.  I'll add it to my "things to do
during sabbatical" list.

[1] I'm 99% sure that it was July 20.  I should set up a calendar of
important dates like the one mom used to keep in the upstairs bathroom.

[2] Way too many to list.

[3] I can't remember the exact situation, but I recall Howard Zinn
running a roundtable objecting to some action of the administration;
probably something having to do with our bellicostic relations with some
other country.

[4] Others might object to the way a constitutional attorney approached
constitutional issues.

[5] No, really.

[6] Sorry, mom.

[7] I'm not sure that I'll ever be able to forgive them for their
role in what happened.

[8] Bolker, Joan L. 1997. "A Room of One's Own Is Not Enough".  In Bolker, Joan (ed.) 1997.  _The Writer's Home Companion_ p. 198.  Found online at

[9] Their spelling of her name on the archive of public broadcasting
is a bit strange: "Freeda Rebelski".

[10] Or maybe _Newsweek_.

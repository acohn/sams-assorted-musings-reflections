Misnaming
=========

Many folks get irritated when someone calls them a name other than
their own.  It may be the name of someone who looks like them [1].
It may be their dead name.  It may be the name of a relative.  It may
be a name that has no clear assocation to them.

Middle Son experiences that feeling with some regularity.  Today, for
example, it was announced that "Samuel Rebelsky is your senator from
Smounker".  He also gets email that is intended for me, and I sometimes
get email that is intended for him [2].  Eldest Son also got my email with
some regularity [3].

I'll admit that I fall into the category of "misnamers".  There are 
students who have similar name patterns that I've inverted with some
regularity, even when one graduated and the other hadn't.  I regularly
use the same name for two of my research students, who do not look or act
similarly.  In the past, I've used a student's dead name much too much.

Chill!

[1] Unfortunately, some people experience other peoples' broad view of
"looks like you", such as "has a similar skin color to you".

[2] I believe that there was at least one time when *he* sent me
email that he wanted to send to himself.  It's the wonder of computer
autocomplete.

[3] One of my favorite such instances was when there was a discussion
of bystander training [4] that I was attending.  Someone sent out a
message that said something like "Don't forget to attend the disussion
of bystander training."  While he had no memory of agreeing to attend
such a session, he is both a trained bystander and a trainer, and so
he assumed that the email was intended for him and he showed up [5].

[4] Yes, "trained bystander" is one of my favorite oxymorons.

[5] I did, too.

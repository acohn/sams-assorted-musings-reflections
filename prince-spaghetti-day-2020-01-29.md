A few months ago, soon after I started taking a water aerobics
class, one of my fellow students and I were talking about our
backgrounds.  We soon realized that we were both from the northeast,
she was from Rhode Island and I'm from the Boston area [1].  I can't
recall which of the key regionalisms we discussed: frappes, jimmies,
candlepin bowling, "wicked", Necco Wafers.  But it was Wednesday
in class, and when one of us said "Wednesday is", the other said
"Prince Spaghetti Day".  At that point, I said something like the
following.

> On most days, Anthony dawdles on his way home from school.  But
on Wednesdays, Anthony races home because, in Boston's North End,
Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.

We left it at that.  I did wonder how many times I'd seen the ad and
why brain cells were still devoted to that narration.  But I accept
that we have no control over our brains.

A bit later, my fellow student said that she'd heard [a report on
the advertisement on
NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/780949208/prince-pasta-anthony-commercial-turns-50-continues-to-resonate).  That NPR piece has the following bits from
the advertisement.

> [Mother calling] Anthony. Anthony.

> [Announcer] Anthony Martignetti [3] lives in Boston in the Italian North End.

> [Announcer] And as every family in the North End of Boston will tell you,
Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.

I clearly didn't recall all of it.  But I'm pretty sure there's more
than what's in the NPR piece.  Fortunately, [a version of the
advertisement lives on on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8ti1hnLiLw).

> [Mother calling] Anthony, Anthony.

> [Announcer] Anthony Martignetti lives in Boston on Prince Street
in the Italian North End, the home for more than fifty years of the
Prince Spaghetti Company.  Anthony knows a lot about local Italian
customs and he knows a lot about Prince because that's a local
custom.

> [Announcer] Prince is more than just authentic, it's something that
grows you with wheat germ energy other pastas leave out.

> [Announcer] Most days, Anthony takes his time going home, but not
today.

> [Announcer] Today is Wednesday.

> [Announcer] And, as every family in the north end of Boston will
tell you, Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.

I don't remember all of that.  Perhaps it's because it's a one-minute
version of the commercial, and most commercials were thirty seconds.
Is there a thirty-second version out there?  [Yes, there
is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNX1QtyG9_8).

> [Mother calling] Anthony, Anthony.

> [Announcer] Anthony Martignetti lives in Boston in the Italian
North End, the home of the Prince Spaghetti Company.

> [Announcer] Anthony knows a lot about Prince because it's something
that grows you.

> [Announcer] Most days, Anthony takes his time going home, but not
today.

> [Announcer] Today is Wednesday.

> [Announcer] And, as every family in the north end of Boston will
tell you, Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.

That's closer to what I remembered.  Did I really need to use brain cells
remembering that?  At least I didn't retain a visual memory of the ad.

Anthony's last name is Martignetti.  There was a Martignetti Liquors
near where I grew up, by the former Sammy White's Brighton Bowl,
down the road from the International House of Pancakes.  I wonder
how common the last name "Martignetti" is.  

I miss Sammy White's, which has been gone for decades.  I see that
[Martignetti's has closed,
too](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/restaurants/2017/03/03/martignetti-liquors-closing/).
Mom would be sad.  I wonder if the International House of Pancakes
is still there.  It's a chain, there's probably one near my new
home.  I suppose I could visit the one in Coralville or Des Moines.

Did [Barilla Pasta](https://www.barilla.com/en-us) have a similar
ad?  I suppose I don't know enough about my new home state to try
to come up with an Iowa variant of the Prince ad.  

Am I correct in associating Barilla with Iowa?  There's a big factory
up in Ames.  But it looks like their home office is in Italy.  Imagine
that.

Is Prince Pasta still around?  [It seems to
be](https://www.princepasta.com/), even though it's now part of the
New World Pasta Family of Brands, which is part of [Riviana
Foods](https://www.riviana.com/), which is itself "[a wholly owned
subsidiary of Madrid, Spain-based Ebro Foods,
S.A.](https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/14843-riviana-foods-expanding-ready-to-serve-rice-plant-in-memphis)

I wonder if Prince still uses wheat germ.

**_Postscript_**:  I'd recommend listening to 
[the NPR piece](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/780949208/prince-pasta-anthony-commercial-turns-50-continues-to-resonate).  It presents some useful
cultural context that I had not recalled or not understood.

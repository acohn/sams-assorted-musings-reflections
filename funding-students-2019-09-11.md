Funding CS student travel
=========================

One of my roles in the department is to help arrange funding for student
travel to conferences related to broadening participation in computing.

Dear CS Students,

This semester has seen a significant uptick in requests for funding for student travel to conferences, particularly the Grace Hopper Celebration and Tapia.  I thought it appropriate to provide you with a bit of information about these kinds of funding.

Most importantly, the department does not have a regular budget line for student conference travel.  We rely on the donations we receive from faculty, alumni, and current students to support student conference travel.  Those same donations also help support CS table, the SEPC, WGMC, our celebration of CS seniors, graduation breakfast, and more.  We are fortunate that both our general department fund and our diversity fund received large donations over the past five years.  However, both of those funds are being spent at a rapid rate.  In fact, if we continue to spend at the current rate, we will have exhausted the diversity fund by the end of 2020-2021.  [At some point in the near future, I plan to once again remind some of the past beneficiaries of that fund that they should consider helping replenish it.]

We generally try to allocate these funds in an equitable way.  That usually means that we announce applications for particular events and restrict funding to those who apply to us.  Increasingly, we are asking students to do due diligence in seeking funding.  That is, students should not just apply to the department; they should also apply to the conference (many conferences provide some funding) and to other funds on campus.  Students should also consider submitting their work (including significant class projects) to conferences they hope to attend.

Some of you have learned that the Wilson Program is no longer accepting applications to fund travel to Grace Hopper and Tapia.  That's a recent decision.  While the department had traditionally applied directly to Wilson, a few years ago Wilson asked us to have students apply directly.  Toward the end of this summer, they informed us that they were returning to the old model and gave us funds to support approximately three students.  Those funds have already been allocated. (Actually, because of miscommunication, they have probably been over-allocated.)

At this point, we will not fund any more students for either GHC 2019 or Tapia 2019.  We will take as many students as we can to MINK-WIC.  Right now, it looks like we still have a bit of room in the vans, so feel free to apply.  And for context, it costs about 1/10 as much to send students to MINK-WIC as it does to GHC or Tapia.  (It may even be less than that.)

Regards,

Allies (part of a draft letter to the incoming chair)
====================================================

_I've now completed [the first few sections of my letter to the 
incoming chair](index-incoming-chair).  Those sections deal with
the various tasks for which the chair is responsible.  In this
section, we turn to the many people who help the chair in their
work._

---

As you have likely noticed by now, there is a lot of work associated
with running our department.  **You should not attempt to do it yourself.**
You have a variety of allies (and one Allie) to help.  Here are some.

_Your Colleagues in the Department_.  We are a collegial department and
generally happy to share tasks.  Make sure that we divide tasks in the
early fall and revisit throughout the year.  We are all overworked,
so you may have to check in once in a while to make sure that we
are accomplishing our tasks.  I count Sarah Dahlby-Albright, our
Peer-Education Coordinator, as one of the department colleagues.  Sarah
has been great not only at helping out on a wide variety of tasks, but
also on helping us think through various issues from a fresh perspective.

_The Science Division Academic Support Assistants_.  The ASA's can (and
should) do much of your administrative support.  They are willing to
work creatively to support you; for example, for a time, Allie was
responsible for making sure that College events ended up on my Outlook
calendar.  Angie Story can help you think about ways in which the ASA's
can best support you.

_The Student Educational Policy Committee_.  The SEPC should help with
various aspects of running the department.  You can, for example, task
them with keeping the commons clean and running the CS Extra Internship
session.

_Departmental Student Assistants_.  In my previous term as chair,
we could ask Angie for money for Departmental Student Assistants.
I assume that that's still possible.  A DSA can take on some of the
responsibilities that do not seem appropriate for the ASA's.  Henry
was better at using DSAs than I was, so you may also want to check 
with him.

_Our Other Students_.  We are fortunate to have an excellent set of
engaged students.  While they are busy, you can usually find some who
will volunteer to help you with almost any task.

_The Dean's Office_.  The Dean's office staff are available to help with
information, data, and more.  They are busy enough that you may 
sometimes need to remind them of materials you need or expect, such
as department data.  The Associate Deans can provide guidance and
advice.

_Dean Latham_.  Mike knows that our department is experiencing severe
growing pains.  I've found that he's always willing to talk and to 
help brainstorm approaches.  He's been able to provide some extra
direct and indirect support, too.  [Details elided].

_The Registrar's Office_.  Like Mike, the Registrar's office is
particularly aware of the stresses on our department.  All the members
have been helpful in one way or another, but I've found that Vickie
and Jason are particularly good at helping us think through options.

_The Office of Analytic Support and Institutional Research_.  I have
found that OASIR is always willing to provide me with the data that
I need.  Carlie VanWilligen has been particularly helpful.

_Careers, Life, and Service_.  CLS considers us a good partner
and we try to treat them as such.  They do a wonderful job of scheduling
alumni recruiting visits, including handling the details of setting up
student mock interviews.  They can sometimes help fund student activities,
such as trips to nearby career fairs or grad school open houses.  I lose
track of who does what there, but I've found that most people will direct
you in the appropriate direction.

_Your Fellow Chairs_.  CS runs differently than other departments.
But we also do many things in common with other departments and it can
be useful to hear from others about how and what they do.  For example,
History is particularly good at keeping a document archive that lives
from chair to chair and Sociology is especially careful on transitions.

_Informally Affiliated Faculty and Staff_.  We have some faculty and staff
who seem particularly closely tied to the CS department.  That list
includes most of Math/Stats, a few Library Faculty ([details elided]),
and the faculty involved in the Digital Liberal Arts initiative.
Math/Stats has been particularly helpful at working with us to garner
extra support for MAT/CSC 208.

_Other Faculty Members_.  There are tasks that are done better together.
You will find that other faculty can be excellent collaborators.

_The Center for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment_.  The CTLA can be
particularly helpful as we mentor our young faculty in their teaching.
(David is currently quite overwhelmed.  But when things settle down,
he might be able to help more directly.)

_Student Affairs and Academic Advising_.  We have good relationships
with them and work together to find ways to best support our students.

_Almost Everyone Else_.  While I rant a lot about other offices on campus,
I find that we do share many common goals.  People do not always
have the time or resources to help, but most will help when they can.
At times, you can even delegate to some of them!

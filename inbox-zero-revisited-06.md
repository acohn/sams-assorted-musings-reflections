Inbox zero, revisited, stage six
=================================

Never manage to finish, so broken up into episodes, more or less.

Note: August 21 was the second edit.  (Did I even manage an edit?)
August 13 was the first edit.

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email), rambly, disjoint*

**Partial update, August 13**

Life happens.

In this case, I got busy with the last week of research with my students.
Then I had some tasks at home.  And then I had five days in which I was
essentially afk [1] - three days at a conference and two days traveling.
Those last five days were particularly problematic; things build up 
quickly.

After those five days, I was at 1926 messages, 1211 of which were unread.
And some of the read messages require detailed responses.  I said to
myself, "Let's see what I can do."
First, I got rid of the cruft, including obvious advertisements [2] and
no-longer-needed newsletters [3].

I forgot to record where I ended up, but I did make a significant dent
in the email.  And I convinced myself that I should follow a friend's
recommendation and set up email filters [4].

**Update, 21 August 2018**

I intended to get back to this musing on August 21.  Why another week?
During that week, I had my [staycation](staycation-2018-08).  While I had 
some time to work through mail then, it wasn't enough.  But the email
was mostly staying in check.  Unfortunately, it appears that I forgot to
add much to this musing or even to record the status.

However, I did manage to follow my plan of adding filters to my mailbox
[that's probably why I didn't actually update the musing].  Terrifyingly
enough, there are about 48 different kinds of advertisements I receive
as well as 42 categories of things that I'm considering "newsletters".
[no, I'm not providing you with a complete list; perhaps I'll write more
in a future musing].  Damn, that's a lot.  And that's after lots and lots
of "unsubscribe" requests.  At some point, I'll need to cut some more.
But for now, fewer things will appear to me each day.

**Update, 31 August 2018**

I've been back to work for about two weeks and doing my best to keep up.
However, even trying to keep up, email seems to be eating me alive.
I spent about four hours at the start of the day just answering email
messages and dealing with followup issues.  (I thought about leaving it
until the end of the day, but some messages needed prompt responses.)
I don't know what would have happened if I was also teaching classes.  It's
still bad, since I have a ton of writing to do [I know that writing is
not measured by weight; you know what I mean].

It's much more peaceful ignoring the ads and most of the newsletters. (I
kept Chronicle and Insider Higher Ed in the inbox; I really enjoy reading
those each day.)  Although I'd thought I'd skim through them at the end of 
each day, I haven't been doing so.  I'll report in a future update whether
I manage to start doing so once life is calmer.

After the three hours, where do things stand?  1773/825 inbox.
The ads inbox, which I've been ignoring since August 23rd?  233/222.
The newsletters inbox?  Surprisingly, that's worse.  365/310.  But that's
because I moved my Facebook and Twitter messages to that box.  Plus,
Portside sends me five messagese each day.  Those also take longer to
clear out.

[1] Away From Keyboard.

[2] I identified something like 25 different kinds of advertisements I
receive.

[3] About twenty different newsletters, if I count correctly.

[4] Mail.app does a moderately good job of filtering.  But this is one of
those cases in which I miss having a Linux mail system.

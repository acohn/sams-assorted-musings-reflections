Borrowed, Used, and Downloaded
==============================

*Disclaimer:  This essay represents my attempt to think through what seems
like a complex question [1].  Since I benefit from the ideas of others, I
am likely to write a followup essay in which I revise my thoughts based on
the comments I receive [4].*

A few months ago ...

Response to question from middle son, probably when I suggested that he
borrow Discworld novels from the library rather than buy them.  

> I know that there's a legal difference between downloading and borrowing
/ buying used, but is there a moral difference?  If free downloading is
wrong because the author and publisher receive no compensation, why is
it okay to borrow from the library or buy a used copy?

I found it an interesting question.  

Copyright.  In the US, designed to promote the common good by giving economic
incentive to people who create.

Legal.  First-sale doctrine in the US.  Balancing economic rights.

Downloading allows larger-scale unpaid use.  Is scale an issue?

Scale may be an issue if pricing reflects economic models.  K% get bought
and kept.  U% people will be bought and resold, an average of R times ([]or,
more likely, there's a resale distribution). L% will be purchased by libraries,
and loaned to approximately P patrons ([]again, a distribution, []or maybe it doesn't really matter; we don't care about consumers, we care about copies)

The economic model is changing.  Duh.

Repricing: Makes textbooks even more expensive.  Those prices feel immmoral.
([] Okay, most economics seems immoral, or perhaps just amoral, since morality
does not seem to play a role in most economic models.)

Should morality be reactive?  If the publisher is immoral, can I be, too?
Probably not.  Nonetheless, while I criticize all students who seem to
have illegally downloaded copies of their texts, I am much more critical
of students who do so with texts that I consider "reasonably priced",
such as CLRS ([]1300+ pages of dense text, and about $80 on Amazon)
and SaaS ($10 for a Kindle edition; $40 for a print edition).  I do think
we have a moral responsibility to support people who try to "play fair"

Separate but related issue: Out-of-print.  What rights do authors/publishers
have to keep their works from the public?

[1] I wrote the disclaimer first [2].  I could be wrong; it could be that this
is a simple topic.  However, I think not [3].

[2] Yes, I do go back and edit my texts.  But it felt like this disclaimer
should stay, no matter what.

[3] ...

[4] That assumes, of course, that I actually receive comments [5].

[5] Is that intended to encourage people to comment?  Perhaps.  I really
do want to hear what others think about this issue [6,7].

[6] If I were a more responsible thinker, I'd probably do some more research
on what others say about this issue, rather than just relying on my friends.
So, maybe I'll write a followup whether or not I receive comments.  I'd rather
do some less-informed thinking before I go on to seeing what appears in
"the literature" on this issue.

[7] This question would be one that I would have really enjoyed talking
to Richard Fyffe about.  I really miss him, and not just for that reason.

Portable cellos
===============

A few months ago, the College brought in a visiting musician who
performed on what were clearly custom-made instruments.  At a post-concert
reception, we ended up talking about how one travels with instruments [1].
I recall that he mentioned that he owned a large lute-like instrument
with a foldable neck to make it easier to travel with [2].

A few days later, I saw that a recently released album included
music played on a "trench cello", a WWI-era cello the size of an
ammunition case that you attach a neck and strings to.  (My quick read ...)
I can't tell if it's really an ammo case.

Then I went looking further.  I see that they now make
very different "travel cellos".  <http://travelcello.net/>

Since mom played cello, part of me wonders what she would have thought.
On the one hand, I think she would have preferred her real cello.  On
the other, she was attracted enough to some gimicks that she might have
considered one.  And, well, when I ran out of things to buy her for
her birthday, perhaps one of these would have been a good idea.

[1] Enough time has passed that I don't remember all of the details.  But
I do remember someone commenting that he'd been discussing or writing about
the issue already.

[2] No, he did not bring it to Grinnell.

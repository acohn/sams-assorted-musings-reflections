Portable cellos
===============

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

A few weeks ago, the College brought in a visiting musician who performed
on what were clearly custom-made instruments.  At a post-concert
reception, we ended up talking about how one travels with instruments.
While he didn't bring one to Grinnell, I seem to recall that he mentioned
one of the large lute-like instruments with a foldable neck.  Anyway,
a few days later, I saw that a recently released album included
music played on a "trench cello", a WWI-era cello the size of an
ammo case that you attach a neck and strings to.  (My quick read ...)

Notes: You know how there are some people who you work with for a long
period of time, and don't really think about it, and then it suddenly
clicks how special they are?  That's how I feel about my experience
with Karen.

Evidence of gender bias in how students talk about her.  (Endnote: Will she let
me keep this?)

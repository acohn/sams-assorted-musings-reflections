How do I get into CSC 151?
==========================

*Topics/tags: [CSC 151](index-csc151), academia, advice for current students*.

This week, first-year students are preparing to register for classes.
I've written about [first-year registration](registration-first-year)
before.  I may not have mentioned that many students need to discuss
their placement as they plan their prospective schedules.  Math has the
most visits, but CS has a bunch, too.

Yesterday, a student stopped by to chat about CSC 151 [1], the first course
in the CS curriculum.  Although they had taken prior CS classes, they
understood that the design of Grinnell's curriculum is such that it
makes sense to start in 151.  Then they said "I'm worried about 151."
I prepared to reassure them that although CSC 151 has a reputation as
a challenging class, even for students with some background, nearly
everyone who takes the course does well.

But that wasn't their worry.

The followed that first statement with "I'm worried that I won't get in
to CSC 151."  Unfortunately, that is a reasonable worry.  Large numbers
of students are interested in CS and, although it looks like we will soon 
have enough faculty to support interest, that still doesn't mean that
it's easy to get into 151 in your first semester.  I thought it would 
be worthwhile to document the advice I gave.  Let's see ....

*You probably won't get into CSC 151 in the fall unless you make it your
first choice in the first round* [2].  I'm pretty sure I've said that to
students for the past few years.  Last year, CSC 151 filled midway through
the first round.  I think we have a few more slots available this year,
but it's unlikely that slots will be available in the second round.

*Every first-year student who wants to take CSC 151 will get it in spring
if they don't get it in the fall.*  I realize that some of our peer
institutions have reached the stage that they don't guarantee that every
interested first-year student can enroll in CS.  I would raise a ruckus
if we reached the stage that did not provide the course to all interested
first-year students [3].  We had no trouble meeting that goal last year,
and we are offering one more section this year.

*It doesn't matter if you start the CS major in your first semester or your
second semester.*  We've tried to design the curriculum so that it's
relatively straightforward to complete the CS major in six semesters.
That means that you can start in your second semester, study abroad
for a semester without studying CS [4], and still complete the major.
We've even had students complete the major in five semesters.  One
outlier found a way to complete the major in four semesters, but it's
almost certain that no one could repeat that achievement.  I didn't
tell the student, but it seems that the students who start in their first
semester and those who start in their second semester tend to form
separate communities.  In my experience, the communities unify in their
third year, and the active students tend to be comfortable in both.

*It's worthwhile to put your name on the waiting list.*   We sometimes
have people drop.  This year, I think we may be doing a few other things
that will allow us to take people off the waiting list.  However, at least
for fall semester, I think the only people we will allow on the waiting
list will be people who put us first in the first round.

*One of the purposes of a liberal arts education is to explore a
wide variety of topics; if you don't get into CSC 151, try something
different.*  One reason to attend a place like Grinnell is that you
aren't completely certain what you might study.  Give other disciplines
a chance.  Just as we have some CS majors who did not plan to study CS
when we came to Grinnell, those who study CS might find that they are
equally passionate about, say, Philosophy or Sociology.

*Ask to be added to the CS mailing list.* Being on the list won't
increase your odds of getting into CSC 151, but it will help you be part
of the community.  Even if you don't take CS your first semester, you
can still participate in our social activities and attend the various
talks and such.

[1] Yes, I realize that I'm on sabbatical.  But I needed to be around
the department and, as long as I was around the department, it seemed
valuable to talk to students.

[2] You can see [the prior musing on registration](registration-first-year)
for what that means.

[3] I would even consider giving up my sabbatical if necessary.  But I
don't expect it to come to that.

[4] Increasingly, our students are finding ways to take CS while studying
abroad.

A sign of the apocalypse
========================

*Topics/tags:* [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), illustrated

Anyone who has seen my office on Noyce 3rd [1] knows that, even at its
best, it is a mess [2].  Not only am I a pack rat [3], but I also like
to accumulate new things.  And so my office is filled with books, supplies,
papers, artworks, tchotchkes, and more.  A few of the campus marketers have
said that they like it because it has "texture".  I've been known to tell
my students that 

> I keep it like this so that you feel comfortable; if your
dorm room doesn't look this way, you probably have a friends whose room
does. 

Sometimes I give an alternate explanation.

> It's an art project reflecting on the power of entropy; I keep making
piles and then I leave them where they fall.

What does it usually look like?  Here's a picture from the end of spring
semester.

Do you see what they mean by "texture"?

And doesn't that seem like a good opportunity for a game of "I Spy"?  I spy
a mug from the University of Chicago Divinity School Coffee Shop.  I spy
a napkin ring painted like a fish.  I spy one of the dozens of photocopied
pictures of me that someone put up all over the building [4,5].  I spy the
cap that my Tutorial students wore to Convocation.

Spring was also a bit worse than normal because I had less time to pick
things up [6].  On the other hand, there are usually a few more papers on
the floor. I may have done some straightening at the end of the semester
as I looked for final exams that had gotten mixed in with other things.

Oh.  Never mind. That's after a day of straightening.  Here's what it 
really looked like at the end of spring semester, immediately after
graduation.

In most summers, I try to make a little headway on the office.
Sometimes I succeed.  Sometimes I fail.  However, this year was special.
Because I'm on sabbatical this year, I need to vacate my office for
my leave replacement [7].  I will admit that "vacate" sounds extreme.
I believe the idea was that I was to make it habitable for my leave
replacement and that I had to leave one shelf clear for books, one drawer
for office supplies, and one file drawer for, well, files.  I was also
allowed to make up to ten boxes to transport to my new office [8].

And so I went to work on what .  I worked on removing things from my office.
I worked on organizing my lab [9].  I worked on removing things from my lab.
It felt very much like a Sisyphean task.  Most tellingly, it felt like
each time I made forward progress, something else fell and made the room
feel even worse.

But I kept trying.  I chose books and supplies to box up.  I recycled
a lot of paper.  I sent a bunch of old student work to the shredder
[10].  I got rid of a bunch of books [11]. I tried to get rid of even more
[14].  I expect to make another pass through my books during sabbatical.
I promised myself that I will either catalog each book still in my lab
or discard it.  The ones in my office will have to wait for another year.

After way too many hours, I think I accomplished what I was asked to do.
Here's what my office looks like now.

Since folks have already asked: No, that image has not been Photoshopped [16].
And yes, it's really a picture of *my* office.

Of course, it's not currently my office, since the College has assigned it
to someone else.  But it's the room that *was* my office.  And, well,
it's essentially my office, since I own the books, the artwork, the desk,
and such.  More importantly, I'll be back there next year [18].

I wasn't sure it could be done.  I'm pretty sure the Dean's office didn't
think it could be done.  But my office is ready for someone new.  Or perhaps
it's just a sign of the apocalypse.

The real question: *Can I keep it straight when I return?* [17].

Next up: My home office, the garage, my lab, my storage area in the
basement, the workshop, and more.  Maybe not; that sounds like more than
I can handle, even in a year of sabbatical.  Still, I should be able to
make some progress on each of those areas.

Postscript: I had originally tagged this as a short musing.  But it
grew.  That may not be surprising; the mess in my office grows, too.

Postscript: You can expect a few more musings on related topics.  I
expect that I'll discuss my new office, the tchotchkes I saw fit to
move to my new office, and perhaps even some of the books I moved to
that office.  I may even continue to include photos.  Stay tuned.

Postscript: This musing is in honor of David James Sherman, who had to
share an office with me through most of graduate school.

[1] Or even my former office on Noyce 2nd.

[2] Some might even call it a pigsty.

[3] Hoarder.

[4] No, it was not me.

[5] Whoops.  That one's only in the next picture.

[6] It stays better when I have a weekly meeting with a student who acts
as my "organization assistant".  But both they and I were too busy this
year.

[7] That policy is new at Grinnell, and not universally applied.  One
of my junior colleagues is also on leave and is keeping their office.
Since we needed a space for our visitor, I volunteered to give mine up.

[8] More on that topic tomorrow.

[9] Even messier than my office.

[10] I even got rid of all of the CSC 151 end-of-semester quizzes and
surveys that I had hoped to use for a research project.

[11] Some are still in the CS Commons, if you want to take a look.  There
are many old CS texts, some statistics texts, some bioinformatics texts,
and a variety of other books, too [12].  Here's a picture of about 1/4 of
the ones I got rid of.

That giant Coke cooler?  Something else I acquired.  At least I donated
it to the department immediately after acquiring it.  It's even proven of
use in some years.

[12] I don't know why I ended up with two copies of Austin Kleon's _Steal
Like an Artist_, but I did, and decided to get rid of one.

[14] That is, I offered them to colleagues.  Some, colleagues took.  Others,
they didn't take and I decided I couldn't part with them unless I knew they
had a good home [15].

[15] Sorry Micki.

[16] "Every noun can be verbed."  I've seen this quotation attributed
to [Paul Krugman](https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1083802055146434560), [Alan Perlis](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/765127), and George Bernard
Shaw [17].

[17] Which makes it particularly funny that [The Irish Times](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/con-text-verbing-1.904390) attributed it to "Some American".

[18] Unless I get asked to vacate the office completely so that a new
tenure-line faculty member can occupy it.

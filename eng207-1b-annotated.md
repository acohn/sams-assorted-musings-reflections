Like much of what I write, or think, or say, my manuscript for
English 207 is riddled with names and ideas that are likely
incomprehensible to anyone but me.  I thought it would be fun to
fill in a few of the details from [the manuscript](eng207-1b-manuscript)
that you may have read recently.  In addition to the explanations of
various things, I've also tried to include some notes about the
broader piece and how I was responding to some of the tasks that I
set for myself.

I used my endnote system for the annotations.  I suppose that I could 
have used Hypothes.is or learned a way to put them next to the things
I was annotating.  But I was more interested in saving my time than
yours.

This piece is long, even for me.  I've added about 3,000 words of
annotations to the 2,000 words in the original work.  Feel free to
skim around, looking only for annotations on parts of interest.

And if you don't want to scroll through, looking for the song, it's
Jimi Hendrix's version of Bob Dylan's "All Along the Watchtower".
You can read about lyrics and choice in <a href="#referent65">endnote 65</a>.

**Office Hours**

There’s a board outside the door.  The board contains an unexpected
variety of ephemera: a piece of cloth reading "Faculty for Self-Gov" [1],
a colorful 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper saying "Safe Space", an
envelope full of Title IX resource cards [2], a reproduction of Zoe
Leonard’s _I want a president_ [3], a Daniel Pinkwater standardized test
(on it, a student has scrawled "I took this!") [4], the ubiquitous "No
matter where you are from, we’re glad you’re our neighbor" [5], cartoons
by Keith Knight [6] and Gary Trudeau [7], a manifesto that suggests "As
citizens and computer scientists we are obligated to assess and
understand the impacts of computing on society" [8],  a photograph of
a faculty member in a Tigger outfit [9], the cover of a book entitled
_Experiments in Java_ [10].

The first thing you notice as you enter the room is the sheer volume
of books.  Or the oriental carpet, incongruous [11].  A red stapler [12].
The paper, piled everywhere---on the table, on the desk, on chairs,
on that carpet---piles, on piles, on piles.  Some playing cards, alone
and in decks.  Vases full of flowers at both ends of the desk [14].  A
drill from a dentist’s office [15].  Paintings and photos, displayed on
high and at angles.  A Barbie® doll [16].  What appear to be two red,
deflated, soccer balls, perched on a shelf [17].  Candy wrappers.  A
green plant, overflowing the top of the file cabinet by the door [18].
A slab of marble.  Your exam, carelessly strewn but nonetheless
sitting patiently on the table, awaiting discussion.

You deflect, or perhaps I do.  The large round stone, filled with
holes, perched on the shelf?  A fossilized whale bone, or so my
mother told me, found beachcombing on the Vineyard [19] in the early
1970’s, back when we still went to the Vineyard.  The Tang Horse,
perched on its fading box, displayed proudly on the too-high window
sill?  Mom was invited to give a speech in China soon after it
opened to the west; she brought that back.  A giant, hand-painted,
uneven, somewhat oval, orange smiley face, tacked to the south wall,
and only visible once you sit down at the table?  One of my kids
made that; it makes me happy.  Which child?  I’m not sure [20].  Six
garish pink boxes labeled _What’s your point_?  One of my favorite
alums helped design that game, a hybrid of an improv activity and
a PowerPoint presentation with a previously unseen deck [21].  Those
red, appetizing, glossy, deflated, substantial, soccer balls [22]?  I
took sculpture during my last sabbatical.  One of my fellow students
cast them.  I think they left Grinnell for architecture school after
that semester.  In any case, I liked their work and they were willing
to share.  I may have traded them a few of the half-pyramids (more
precisely, _Lower half, horizontally bisected square pyramid with
45° slope_ [23]) that I sawed, molded, formed, and cast.  Another
peer’s piece lies on the floor outside the office.  Perhaps you
noticed it [24].

The questions continue.  The stack of keyboards, piled in the corner
[25]?  ITS was going to throw them away [26].  I thought I’d pry
off the keys and use them for an art project.  I’ve since had the
good fortune to visit an exhibit of Elias Sime’s [27] work at the
Wellin [28].  Now, I may be too humbled to start.  The slab of
marble?  Rescued from the discard pile when the sculpture near East
Campus was made.  The mailbox face?  Trash picked when the bookstore
was closing; I recall Kington making a joke when he saw me in the
dumpster [29]. In any case, I appreciate the aesthetics and its ties to
a Grinnell of old.  The unassembled boxes, leaning against one of
the many bookshelves?  I’m moving offices, a smaller space [30].

Some items seem somehow detached from the sentiments expressed in
the signs tacked outside the office.  Why the plastic, perky,
unnatural and unachievable representation of the female figure?
You think, "It’s somewhat creepy that an adult has that doll in
their office, still in the packaging."  I explain that it’s Computer
Engineer Barbie® and I bought it because I appreciated the effort
to encourage young women to consider careers in computing.  Plus,
Computer Engineer Barbie® has Tux [31] on her shelf.  Libre [32]!
I hate the children’s book they released at the same time, a book
which completely undermines the doll’s positive message about women
and computing [33].  I prefer the feminist remix, which I have somewhere
else in the office, but pull up on my computer instead [34].  You think,
"They’ve said way too much about this doll, or at least have too
rehearsed an explanation."  Perhaps creepy is right.

You ask about the flowers and plants.  I must admit that they are
plastic.  But they do brighten up the place.  Once upon a time, an
alum, having recalled them, brought me a live plant.  It died within
the month.  Its corpse remains on the window sill [35].  Naturally [36].

An inspirational poster labeled **Challenges** [37] reminds you of your
high-school guidance counselor’s office.  Surely college faculty
would be more sophisticated than that.  Then you read the underlying
message: "I expected times like this – but I never thought they’d
be so bad, so long, and so frequent."  You empathize, but continue
to wish your faculty would exhibit more sophistication.

Is that large framed poster containing a large photograph of a metal
object also intended to inspire?  And why is the glass cracked at
the bottom [38]?  You lean closer to read, and learn that it quotes
Bishop Desmond Tutu, "We don’t want our chains made more bearable;
we want our chains removed."  Perhaps you’ve heard that quote
already.  Liberated [39].  You also learn that the accompany photograph
is by Reginald L. Jackson, Ph.D. and is entitled _The Shackle_.  Is
it appropriate for me to have such a poster?  Have I appropriated [40]?
You don’t want to ask such questions.  I notice your puzzlement and
point you to the plate in the lower-right-hand corner: "Presented
by Community Change, Inc. to Dr. Freda Rebelsky in appreciation for
a lifetime commitment to racial justice."  Interesting [41].

You glance back at the table.  Your eye strays to a page of
hand-written hieroglyphs, seemingly scrawled by a left-handed doctor
after three consecutive nights of call, failing to notice their pen
is running out of ink [42].  You decipher some sentences.  The first two
read: "You enter the office, and query about Klein’s bottle [43].  They
regard your question, and respond using Magritte’s Pipe [44]."  Your
brain speaks critiques---first quietly, then louder, then
unbearably---critiques echoing from a small classroom in the northwest
corner of a cottage on the southeast corner of campus [45], from one or
more rooms up the stairs from that classroom, from a seemingly
comfortable living room down the hall, from a Methodist temple to
writing [46] promiscuous in its spirituality [47], from a seemingly quiet
oasis of wisdom deep in the belly of a hog butcher [48], from a metaphorical
Little Red Schoolhouse in a large lecture hall in a faux-Gothic
cathedral of knowledge in the pit of that butcher’s belly [49], from a
desk or small round table with but two or three people gathered
around [50].

> Too much symmetry makes this piece seem like it’s written by a
computer.  Know your audience [51].  Explain; not everyone will understand
your terms.  Vary your sentence length.  Vary your sentence structure.
Eschew obfuscation [52].  This piece is sophomoric, perhaps even puerile.
Ambiguity [53]!  Don’t feel compelled to use the second person just
because that’s from the most recent piece you read [54].  Fewer adverbs!
Infuse your objects with meaning while acknowledging their
provisionality.  Don’t feel like you have to fit everything in [55].
Ambiguity!  My two-year-old daughter, in the crib, could write
better than this [56].  Don’t use the word "interesting" [57].  Know your
genre; place is not memoir [58].  There are at least twenty basic sentence
structures; learn more than one [59].  Even competent writers struggle
to make meta-writing seem natural [60].  Thank you for this piece, it
will serve as a useful example of habits other students should
avoid [61].  Ambiguity! [62]

You ignore the voices.  You ignore the voices.  You ignore the
voices, but they insist on being heard, raising new points, finding
additional flaws, encouraging the author, encouraging you to ignore
the obvious power dynamic in the room and share their words with
me [63].  You grab a fidget from the table to quiet the voices lest you
speak their truths.  They insist that you address at least one of
the critiques, at least to yourself, before they fade.

"You enter ... They regard."  "They enter ... I regard."  "I enter ...
You regard."  "Phil enters ... Prof. R regards."  "Student enters ...
Professor regards."  "Ashley enters ... I regard."  "Professor enters
... Student regards."  [64] The combinations are nearly endless.

You settle on "You" and "I" [65] for reasons you enumerate.  That quiets
the voices, at least for a time.  But why haven’t I done the same?
Unlike the president, who you’ve heard avoided writing courses in
his B.S., M.D., M.B.A., and Ph.D. [66] (so many letters!), I seem to
embrace writing [67].  I must hear similar voices.  We’ve been through
that, that experience of detailed critiques.  You’re tempted to
suggest changes.  But this is not our fate.  The power differential
is too great; comments seem too risky.  You search for something
else to say.  You consider the volumes around you.

Have I read them all?  I’ve finished a few, perused parts of many
more, rely on the rest as references, save some that serve to support
students [68].  _From Barbie to Mortal Combat: Gender and Computer Games_
[69]?  That’s there because many of my students want to write about
computer games and I know it serves as a good resource.  Or, more
precisely, it once served as a good resource; gender and gaming has
changed significantly in the past decade [70].  A biography of Hallie
Flanagan [71]?  Most students don’t know that Grinnell’s Flanagan theatre
was named after her.  I appreciate a quote from Harry Hopkins near
the beginning, "President Main taught us the value of the arts, and
the WPA will reflect that value."  That’s what made America great [72].
_Sol LeWitt: A Retrospective_ [73]?  I am enamored of his concepts, want
to live within those conceptual walls.  _Experiments in Java_?  No,
it’s not an anthropology text; it’s a CS lab manual I wrote in the
distant past [74].  I wish my publisher had chosen cover art that embraced
that ambiguity [75].

You page through the lab manual.  Computers are precise.  Computers
are organized.  Computers expect humans to be organized.  Zeros and
ones, neatly categorized.  Computers will not abide ambiguity or
subtlety or disorder.  How to explain the space which faces you?

Some peers have told you that they’ve heard me say that I’ve tried
to make my office look like the typical dorm room so that students
feel at home [76].  You ask anyway.  I might tell you that it’s an art
installation, in progress, entitled _Entropy_, for reasons that I
consider obvious [77].  Or perhaps I’ll say it’s a "scientific study,
in progress"; is there really a difference [78]?  Speaking of studies,
I might pull one out from a stack (always organized [79]) and show you
that researchers discovered that some people can achieve clarity
only by filling their lives with distractions; sensory overload
forces them to focus [80].  Are you convinced?  Perhaps not.  You’ve
watched enough TV to know that there’s a more obvious answer:
_Hoarder_.  You don’t know that buried deep---somewhere amidst the
piles of papers, or perhaps tucked in one of the books or under a
tchotchke---is an article that says that students become more
comfortable when they can find an object in the room to fixate on,
ask about, or use to initiate an extended conversation [81].

Now you’re ready to discuss the exam.

**_Postscript_**: Perhaps the thought processes on display in the
manuscript and these annotations explain a bit of why I'm a hoarder.
As a peer suggested, my descriptions in the piece demonstrate what
they've heard about the mindset of a hoarder.

[1] Faculty wore those on our robes at one graduation.  I'm not
sure what the particular incident was that motivated that concern
for the loss of self-governance.  I do, indeed, have that posted
outside my office, along with another slogan that I tagged on my
robe in another year.  (Or I did, since I'm currently away-from-office).
I can't recall what the latter says.

[2] The resource cards tell me what to do if a student reveals a
possible assault.  More importantly, they have both confidential and
non-confidential contacts to share with a student.  I hope that I will
not need these cards, but I consider it important to have them ready.
Since our class mentors are required reporters, I think they should have
a place that they are at hand.  Victims, too, might grab a card 
subtly if they need a list of resources.

[3] Zoe Leonard's [_I want a
president_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_want_a_president) is an
artwork that takes the form of an enlarged broadside, of sorts.  It
begins,

> I want a dyke for president.  I want a person with aids for
  president and I want a fag for vice president and I want someone
  with no health insurance and I want someone who grew up in a place
  where the earth is so saturated with toxic waste that they didn't
  have a choice about getting leukemia.

I saw the work at the Des Moines Art Center and carefully removed the
reproduction from the catalog of the show that I acquired.  I strongly
agree with the sentiment of wanting a president who has suffered in
the ways in which those they represent suffer.

[4] Daniel Pinkwater is a children's book author and occasional NPR
commentator.  He once wrote a short story entitled "The Eggplant
and the Hare", a somewhat absurdist (he says "nonsensical") take
on "The Tortoise and the Hare".  Someone tasked with writing test
questions for one of the many New York standardized tests modified
the story to be "The Hare and the Pineapple" (presumably because
children are more likely to know about pineapples than eggplants)
and then added the kinds of reading comprehension questions you
expect for a standardized test, such as "Before the race, how did
the animals feel toward the pinepaple: A-Suspicious; B-Kindly,
C-Sympathetic, D-Envious" and "The animals ate the pineapple most
likely because they were A-hungry, B-excited, C-annoyed, D-amused".
But this wasn't just wasn't done on a lark; [it ended up on a
standardized
test]((https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/nyregion/standardized-testing-is-blamed-for-question-about-a-sleeveless-pineapple.html).
You can even see [the original, which I posted outside my
office](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/20/nyregion/21pineapple-document.html).

It's outside my office for a host of reasons.  I like Pinkwater as an
author.  I used to listen to a tape of his NPR pieces.  I tend to dislike
standardized testing.  Plus, it's absurd.

And yes, a student did scrawl "I had to take this test", or something
similar, on the test as it sat on my board.

[5] You've seen the sign.  I have multiple copies, including one in
my office window, facing the JRC.  It's an important sentiment.  I got
my copies from the Office of International Studies, or whatever it's
called.

[6] As I suggested in the text, [Keith Knight](https://www.kchronicles.com/)
is a cartoonist.  He writes multiple strips and multiple kinds of
strips, some autobiographical, some political.  You can [support him
on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/keefknight).  I have his "[One
Black Teacher](https://www.kchronicles.com/comic/one-black-teacher/)"
on my board, in part to remind people of why we need faculty who embody
diversity.

[7] I'm pretty sure that most of my readers know who Gary Trudeau is.
He's the prime minister of Canada.  Or was.  No, that's the wrong
Trudeau.  Gary Trudeau writes _Doonesbury_.  I have an early strip
on my board, one in which Mark Slackmeyer is getting ready to expose
an engineering student to the wodners of the liberal arts.  I'd really
like to have the "I wanna give a gym!" strip on my board, but I've
been too lazy to track it down.

[8] That's from my [MathLANifesto](letterpress-2017-08-03).

[9] That's me.

[10] That's my book.

[11] I'm pretty sure that the rug came from mom's front hallway.
We didn't have a place for it at home, and it makes my office look
homey.  Of course, my students joke that you don't know it's there
because there's so much stuff on top of it.

[12] There is, indeed, a red stapler on my table.  But I included it
in this piece because I think of it as signifying the TV show
_Office Space_.  Of course, I don't watch the show, so I could be wrong.
As mom used to say, "Vast swaths of American Popular Culture have
passed me by."

[14] Both came from the chest in the front hallway in Billings park.

[15] No, I don't really have a dentist's drill in my office.  The last
two pieces we read both involved drills, and I thought this would be
funny.  Self restraint is not one of my strong suits.

[16] Explained later in the piece.

[17] Explained later in the piece.

[18] I'm pretty sure I trash-picked the fake plant.  I still like how
it works in my office.

[19] Martha's Vineyard, in case that wasn't clear.  In part, I think
of my piece as being about privilege.  That comment is supposed to be
a signal.

[20] I'm really not sure.  In fact, I don't want to be sure.  In any
case, I love the piece.

[21] It's a great game.  Let me know if you'd like a copy.

[22] How can they be simultaneously deflated and solid?  Because the
artist cast them in plaster, using deflated balls as the molds.

[23] Yup, that's what I called them.  They make really nice building
blocks.  I used them as such in a participatory piece in our pop-up
show.  I like the wood ones the most, but they also take the most 
effort.  I should find a way to mass-produce them.  I suppose I should
add that to the too-long list of things I'd love to do, but will be
unlikely to find time for.

[24] That piece makes me both happy and sad.  I assume most people who
walk down the hall notice it; two slabs of wood, looking somewhat like
mold or a fungus, on the floor by the bench.  They make me happy because
they let me think back to sculpture and because I appreciate the texture
of the work.  They make me sad because someone stole two other slabs that
went with them and because FM removed the title of the work during a
repainting and never replaced it.  Unfortunately, I recall neither the
title nor the artist.

[25] To be honest, the keyboards are in my lab rather than my office.

[26] More precisely, I asked ITS if they had any keyboards they were
planning to throw away.

[27] [Elias Sime](https://www.jamescohan.com/artists/elias-sime) is an
Ethiopian artist who works in different media, but primarily in discarded
computer parts, which he fashions into amazing, quilt-like structures,
but with more dimensionality.

[28] The [Ruth and Elmer Wellin Museum of
Art](https://www.hamilton.edu/wellin) is at Hamilton College.  Sime's
exhibit
[_Tightrope_](https://www.hamilton.edu/wellin/exhibitions/detail/elias-sime-tightrope)
was on display while I was there.  I recall starting a musing about his
work, but I can't find it.  I have the exhibition catalog on order.
Its publication has been delayed twice.  I was at Hamilton for an
external review.

[29] Yes, that's true.  Kington and VP Voos and a few other administrators
walked by while I was looking through the bookstore's discards.  I don't
think it's appropriate to quote publicly what Kington said to me.
(Damn you, Ralph.) (That's not what Kington said; that's what I'm
thinking as I realize that I have to apply some of the ethics of
nonfiction that Ralph is trying to drill into my head.)  When I
returned later in the day, Security chased me away.

[30] More precisely, I moved to another office, at least for this
year.  But the boxes were there at one time.  I also moved previously,
but that's another story.

[31] Tux the penguin is one of the iconic mascots for Linux, a piece of
Free and Open-Source Software.

[32] More precisely, Free, Libre, and Open-Source Software.

[33] You can read [a _New York Times_ article about the issue](https://www.npr.org/2014/11/22/365968465/after-backlash-computer-engineer-barbie-gets-new-set-of-skills).

[34] Here's the [remix by Casey
Fiesler](https://caseyfiesler.com/2014/11/18/barbie-remixed-i-really-can-be-a-computer-engineer/).
I'm not sure "Feminist" is the right term.  Perhaps just "Appropriate".

[35] I'm pretty sure that I finally discarded it when I had to move from
my office.  But it was a nice way to think of the alum.

[36] I wasn't happy about achieving item #5 on [my
assignment](eng207-1b-assignment) with exactly the same word as Abbey.
However, it seemed so natural for this place in my piece.  I'll
admit that I struggled to find something better.

[37] The [Challenges](https://despair.com/products/challenges?variant=2457296067) poster is a Demotivator® from [Despair, Inc.](https://despair.com).  I learned about Demotivators from Charles Cunningham and have them scattered around my life.

[38] I'm not sure.  I think it cracked in a move.

[39] This was my other attempt to achieve #5 on my assignment.

[40] I thought that was a good pair of questions, both conceptually
and in terms of the way the writing works.

[41] Yes, I have intentionally used a word that most faculty would tell
you to avoid.  I address the issue in a subsequent paragraph.  Plus, it
falls into the strategy of "Include a glaring problem for people to identify
so that they don't notice the other problems."  That strategy failed.

[42] I had fun trying to write this sentence.  I wonder whether I should
have gone further.

[43] A [Klein bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle)
is a higher-dimensional analog to a [Möbius
strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip).  Just as
a Möbius strip has only one side, a Klein bottle is a container,
of sorts, in which there is no way to distinguish inside and ouside.
There's an etched-chalkboard rendering of a Klein bottle, entitled
"Klein's bottle", on the staircase landing in the Math/Stats wing
of Noyce.  I was part of the team that selected the artist.  I like
the whole series.

[44] René Magritte's [_The Treachery of Images_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images) is a famous painting of a pipe with the words
"_Ceci n'est pas une pipe._" underneath.  There is also an etched-chalkboard
rendering of that painting, labeled "Magritte's pipe", next to the
Klein image.  I appreciate the implied "This is not a Klein bottle",
because it's not.  It's a two-dimensional rendering of what I think
of as a four-dimensional object.  (I never recall whether Klein bottles
are three-dimensional or four-dimensional, but feel like you need a
fourth dimension to create them, just as you need a third dimension to
put the twist in a Möbius strip.)

[45] [Mears Cottage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mears_Cottage) is at
the southeast corner of Grinnell's campus.  It is currently home to our
departments of English and History, although they will soon be evicted.
I'm taking ENG-207 in the room in its northwest corner.

[46] My instructor went to [Wesleyan](https://www.wesleyan.edu/).
I'm pretty sure it's named after John Wesley, founder of Methodism.
I wanted to find a way to imply that it was the Connecticut Wesleyan,
but failed.  Perhaps I should have used "Middle" or "Midland" or
something.

[47] [Annie Dillard](http://www.anniedillard.com/) taught creative
writing at Wesleyan.  She also wrote [the first piece we read for
class](reading-for-ralph-2020-01-20).  Some online biography I found
said that she describes herself as "spiritually promiscuous".

[48] Carl Sandburg described Chicago as "Hog Butcher to the World".
Grinnell partners with the Associated Colleges of the Midwest for a
writing program at the Newbury library in Chicago each fall.

[49] I took "Graduate and Professional Writing" at the University of
Chicago.  The course had the nickname "Little Red Schoolhouse".

[50] I wonder whether my subconscious was trying for "Where two or three
are gathered in my name."

[51] I used to claim that this was the one common thing that all Grinnell
students learned, since we should all teach it in Tutorial.  But I've
since been told that not everyone emphasizes the concept.

[52] As I've said, I have difficulty restraining myself.  This was a
"meme", of sorts, long before we identified them as memes.

[53] I've been taught that ambiguity is central to creative nonfiction.
I recall an instructor saying "Ambiguity.  Ambiguity.  Ambiguity."  I
added the emphasis.

[54] That's me speaking to myself.  I'd just read Jamaica Kincaid's 
"A Small Place".

[55] Almost certainly me talking to myself.  Also Gerald Mast commenting
on my typical essay, and my own reaction to many Tutorial papers.

[56] Students used to claim that one of my colleagues in Math/CS had
been known to write something similar on their exams: "When my daughter
was two, she could have solved this problem better than you did."  When 
I mentioned this to someone else in the department, they said "Have
you met his daughter?  It's probably true."

[57] One of the maxims I provide to my students.  A chance to have a joke
at my own expense.

[58] While the piece claims to be about my office, it is almost certainly
about me.  On the other hand, we've learned that most creative nonfiction
bridges genres and subgenres.

[59] See _The Art of Styling Sentences_.  One of my readers who
spends most of their time as a faculty member in English shared
this critique with me, although they did give me credit for using
two different structures, and not just one.  Expect a musing on that
topic in the future.

[60] I'm writing about meta-writing.  Does that make this meta-meta-writing?

[61] I have never heard nor given this comment.  But doesn't it feel like
the kind of thing you'd expect some curmudgeonly old faculty member to
write on your work?

[62] In case it wasn't clear, this whole paragraph was item #4 on
[my assignment](eng207-1b-assignment): Reverse a trope or role.  Rather
than me critiqueing the student's work, the student is critiqueing 
my work.  Or perhaps even my critique of their work.

[63] Item #2 on [my assignment](eng207-1b-assignment): Rule of
three, using two identical short sentences and then expanding in
the third.

[64] While I did not try all of these combinations, I did explore how
to identify the two characters in the piece.

[65] Not only is this the choice I made, it's also the start of the song
lyric.  "You and I, we've been through that, but this is not our fate".
It comes from Jimi Hendrix's performance of Bob Dylan's "All Along the
Watchtower".  I appreciate Dylan's lyricism, even though I don't attempt
to replicate it in this piece.  My piece is about feedback, and I
associate Hendrix with feedback.  Lines near the beginning also seem
to resonate with the piece: "There's so much confusion; I can't get no
relief."

[66] Yes, Kington posseses all four degrees.

[67] In retrospect, this feels nastier than I had intended.

[68] I'm not sure that anyone commented on the alliteration in this
sentence.  I worried that it was yet another instance of my failure
of restraint, but perhaps it was okay.

[69] Yes, that's a real book title.  Many of my peer reviewers were not sure.  
I can't believe I misspelled "Mortal Kombat".  
There's also a sequel, [_Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat: New Perspectives
on Gender and Gaming_](https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Barbie-Mortal-Kombat-Perspectives/dp/0262113198/).

[70] I need a fact checker.  _From Barbie to Mortal Kombat_ was released
in 2000.  It's *two* decades old.  Even its sequel was released more than
a decade ago.  At least I'm correct that the dynamic and understanding
have changed.  I wonder what I should have on my shelf now.

[71] Joanne Bentley's [_Hallie Flanagan: A Life in the Theatre_](https://www.amazon.com/Hallie-Flanagan-Theatre-Joanne-Bentley/dp/0394570413/).

[72] I'm not sure if my political commentary succeeded.

[73] [Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt) is a
conceptual artist known, among other things, for his sequence of
Wall Drawings.  The work is actually the instructions for the
draftspeople to make on the wall, rather than what is on the wall.
Or maybe it's a combination.  In any case, I appreciate his work
and loved the opportunity to see [a large retrospective ef
it](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/) at [the Massachusetts Museum
of Contemporary Art](https://massmoca.org).

[74] I would not recommend that you purchase a copy.  It's outdated
and not completely accurate.

[75] That's true.  I loved the ambiguity of the title.

[76] That is my most common statement to students entering my office
and looking around.

[77] I have also said that about my office.  I appreciate how things
just seem to fall from the stacks I make.

[78] Would you really expect someone in a "science" department to
say that art and science are the same.  This was my attempt to
achieve item #6 of [the assignment](eng207-1b-assignment): "Violate
the reader’s expectations of one of the characters'.

[79] I probably shouldn't be fitting more than one technique in
this late in the piece, but Abbey's is also near the end.  Item #7:
"Add an appropriate, but somewhat sarcastic, parenthetical comment
about something unexpected you’ve just revealed about a character."

[80] I have no idea whether or not there's a study about this issue but
I recall reading it somewhere.  In any case, it's how I experience the
world.  I work better in chaos, which I generally tune out.  I do better
with mess than emptiness and with music than silence.

[81] I do not own that article.  It's another factoid that I've been
told, but can't prove.  Still, it feels right and it's a nice sentiment.
And we can stretch the truth a bit, right?  If not, I can always write
the article, perhaps even post it to Wikipedia and then print it out.

[82] That describes my failure to limit my choices to insert things in
the work.

[83] I learned about the term in reading about "All Along the Watchtower".
I also learned that there's a story about the song in which Hendrix asked
Dylan how Dylan felt about the new arrangement of his song, and Dylan
said something like "It's *your* song; I just wrote it."

[84] "CW" is "Content Warning"

[85] Fredric Brown wrote genre fiction, mostly mystery and SF/fantasy.
But he did write one novel intended for the mainstream.  It's called 
"The Office".

[86] The date of the cyclone that tore through Grinnell.

[87] The description of what I own and how I acquired it, as well as
my ability to own that much stuff, reminds me of my privilege.

[88] I had to sneak in one more comment from the instructor.

[89] Suggested by my peers.

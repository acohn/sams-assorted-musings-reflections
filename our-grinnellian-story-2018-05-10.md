It's not *my* Grinnellian story
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), marketing, language, typography*

Today I received a copy of _Our Grinnellian Story_,
the internal guide to our new marketing campaign.
Particularly given what I'd seen on [the marketing
page](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/communications/brand/promise),
I approached the piece with trepidation.  I appreciate what folks are
trying to do, but I'm worried about what they are doing.

I started on a hopeful note. The pamphlet uses the term "story"
rather than "brand". I hate the latter term.  Do folks not remember
what it used to mean to brand people?  It's not quite so bad when we
talk about branding objects.  But, in the end, our marketing is about
people and making those people "Grinnellians". The term "brand" should
not be used for that activity. "Story" is such a better term.

But my hope was short lived. The first page begins "Why BRAND matters".
I'll tell you why it matters.  (Offensive text elided.) [1].

I'd been also been worried about what the text would be like, given
the poor quality or writing on our marketing page. Unfortunately, it's
even worse than the Web page.  Here's a sample.

> Through our academics we support individually advised learning for the
intellectually engaged so they can navigate the world's complexities and
contribute with great responsibility. We do this by offering: Liberal
arts and mentored research that equips Grinnellians to pursue ideas and
knowledge with confidence.

I'm sorry, but my Grinnellian story would be much better written. What
does this even mean?  The individually advised curriculum supports our
academic programs, not the other way around.  I don't even know what it
means for "academics" to support anything [2].  The liberal arts are a
part of our academic program,  And even if I did write something like
this, I would also use the word "equip" rather "equips", given that we
seem to be using a compound noun.

More broadly, my Grinnellian story would also provide greater depth
of explanation [3]. For example, what do "we" mean by "individually
advised education"? I understand an individually advised *curriculum*.
In that case, faculty members work closely with students to develop a
plan of study that will help them grow intellectually and as individuals,
a plan that supports them and challenges them.  "Individually advised
learning"?  I'm not quite so sure about.

I'd also want some better explanation or examples of *how* the liberal
arts and mentored research equip Grinnellians to pursue ideas and
knowledge.  Is the liberal arts themselves, the ways in which
we teach those subjects, the ways students approach them [4], or
some combination of them?  It strikes me that much of what we do
that encourages students to pursue ideas and knowledge is to challenge
them in the classroom.  Is that "liberal arts" or "mentored research"?
From my perspective, it's neither.  It's a form of pedagogy that is
supported by our relatively low student-to-faculty ratio and by 
a broad commitment to such challenges, a commitment shared by both
faculty and students.

I'd also choose different adverbs.  One colleague suggested that we
should really be teaching students to pursue ideas and knowledge "with
humility".  Another, accepting that positive words may "sell" better,
suggested "confidently".  But "with confidence"?  Bleh.

As I said, it's not *my* Grinnellian story.

Once again, I'm left with a dilemma: How do I support the general
concepts within the Grinnellian story while objecting strenuously
to the ways in which the presentation undermines that story?  And what
is this story that I'm supposed to support, in any case?

Let's see ...

We have *a strong academic program*.  No one is surprised by that.
What details of that academic program are particularly important
to the story?  They don't tell us.  I'm going to go with "Faculty
are engaged scholars who challenge both their students and themselves
in the classroom".  I'll use as examples BIO 150, Ross Heanfler's
"Deviance and Social Control", and Erik Simpson's "Lighting the Page".

Students have *opportunities to do substantive research*.  I'm
uncomfortable with the term "mentored research", since that would suggest
that every student is doing a MAP.  But I can pick a wide variety of
interesting research projects, including those in my own department
[5], virtual reality work that includes both Sarah Purcell's virtual
plantation and Jenny Anger's virtual 1930's German art exhibition [6],
Tim Arner's amazing projects that include both _The Grinnell Beowulf_ and
_The Grinnell Writing Guide_, and some of the cool mapping activities I've
seen from Mark Laver and Eiren Shea.  I might also note the experience
of attending a Grinnell Singers concert in which they performed complex
choral music written by one Grinnell student and were conducted by
another Grinnell student [7].

We prefer to focus on *students who can accept these challenges*.
At least I think that's what we mean by "intellectually engaged".
I expect that talking about the challenging courses and interesting
projects will help reveal that.  I could also mention the expected
workload.

We embrace *social engagement* [8], both inside and outside the classroom.
I can likely come up with a variety of examples of student-led projects
that support the College, the town, and the broader world.  I can also
speak to the way the College works to free students from the typical
Colonialist Social Good mentality of "I know what's wrong here and how
to fix it" and to instead encourage them to listen and to support what
communities identify as their needs and solutions.

We *accept and appreciate difference* [9].  In talking about these
issues, I will likely focus on my department and our firm commitment to
broaden participation.  As I've written [10] far too many times, computer
technology is changing the world.  We therefore have an obligation to
ensure that the people who develop that technology represent a wide
variety of viewpoints.  I can also talk about the ways in which the
department designs (and redesigns) our curricula to be more inclusive.

But if I'm honest about difference, I would have to let prospective
students and parents know that many of our students of color find Grinnell
less inclusive than it should be.  Their Grinnellian story is unlikely
to be as positive as mine.  I'm not sure how to incorporate that kind
of story.  Perhaps I'll focus on the aspiration.

If I'm honest about difference, I would also have to accept that many
of our students with conservative viewpoints don't find that that kind
of difference is embraced or appreciated, either.  I think we do better
than many peers at accepting those viewpoints, but we have a way to go
with this issue, too.

I think that covers the main characteristics that the booklet describes.

Or perhaps not.  I see that we also have "personality traits".
Grinnellians are *purposeful* [11], *creative*, *inquisitive*,
*influential*, *genuine*, and *accepting*.  Interesting.  How do I tie all
of that to the rest of the story?  I'll need to work on that question.
I also see that we are *not afraid to ask hard questions and question
easy answers* [12].

Oh well.  I'll tell the story as best as I can.  I'll probably add
one more thing: 

> Grinnellians understand the power of language.  They write thoughtfully
and edit carefully, considering not just style and flow, but also
audience.

Postscript: My writing skills are not such that I would be able to
successfully transform our marketing material into something I could
be proud of [14].  So I'll leave it to others to suggest rewrites.  I'm
pretty sure that some people will be amenable to them.

I will, however, express my interest in supporting the campaign through
a series of questions, partially about the language but also about the
so-called visual identity.  Let's see ...

1. I understand what we mean by an individually advised curriculum.  But what
is "individually advised learning"?

2. I see that there are some fixed graphic elements that we are supposed to
use.  Where do I get copies of those graphic elements, preferably as vector
graphics?

3. While I know that Grinnell Red is Pantone 485 [15] and RGB #DA291C,
the booklet does not provide the RGB values for our secondary palette
or for the tints.  What are those values?  What are the situations in
which we can or should use the various secondary colors?

I was also tempted to ask why they didn't use Futura for "Office of
Communications" on the back of the booklet.  However, that seemed like
overkill.

---

Postscript: I was looking at the booklet with two of my children.
Youngest Son looked at some pages and said "Wow, they were careless with
the printing; look at how many letters get cut off."  Middle Son said
"No, that's intentional; it's part of the design."  Youngest Son said
"If I saw that in marketing material, my first thought would be 'I want
to go somewhere else.'"  I realize that my children are about as snarky
as I am, but that still worries me.

---

Postscript: Are there any font experts out there?  The more I look at
Futura, the more I wonder whether it's really supposed to be used as
an all-caps font.  There's a huge variance in the width of capital
letters, which makes some words look really weird.  For example,
the width of "N" appears to be about three times the width of "L".
Hence, the word "LIVING" appears particularly strange.  Or perhaps
it's supposed to all make me uncomfortable.  That's a good marketing
strategy: "Grinnell: We take you out of your comfort zone."

---

Postscript: Now that I'm done ranting, I'm off to figure out how to
incorporate new font choices into my two primary document creation
workflows [16].  Since I do most of my work on Linux systems and
neither ITS nor Communications seems willing to pay for the fonts [17],
I expect that I'll need to find open-source alternatives [18].

[1] With that over-the-top commentary, I have likely convinced some of
you that I will have nothing sensible to say. I don't care.

[2] Let me rephrase that.  "Academics" are people who work in academe.
So academics can support many things.  Good writing, for example.  But
these aren't the academics they mean, or seem to mean.

[3] Admittedly, my Grinnellian story would likely have too much depth of
explanation, as well as too many digressive endnotes.

[4] That is, supported by individual advising.

[5] I love Jerod's project on text recognition in historical maps.

[6] Today my mind is fuzzy on the details.

[7] No, neither of those was Middle Son.  

[8] No, not in the form of "I have a social engagement this Saturday
night".  More in the form "I am engaged with society".

[9] The original is "embrace and appreciate differences".  But I'd used
"embrace" in the prior paragraph.  I also find that the singular scans
a bit better.

[10] And said.

[11] *Our Grinnellian Story* explains "purposeful" as "respectful,
caring for our selves and our community".  I don't think that's how
most people will read the term, but perhaps I am wrong.

[12] No, I won't take the bait.

[14] A colleague who writes much better than I also expressed concern
about the arduous task of rewriting this material.

[15] For a general perspective on
Pantone 485, you might want to read [this
article](https://atkinsontshirt.com/2015/01/24/pms-485-is-the-color-of-the-devil/),
or at least the title of the article.

[16] I write a *lot* of letters and memos using Markdown, HTML, and
`html2ps`.  I find the workflow efficient and it produces documents
that generally look much nicer than the vast majority of what I receive
on campus.  I also use LaTeX when I'm collaborating with other people
on research papers or large documents.

[17] Not so surprisingly, neither ITS nor Communications seems willing
to pay for something I need to adhere to our Brand identity.  So much
for institutional commitment.

[18] Arguably, I should be using an open-source font in any case.

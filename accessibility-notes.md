Accessibility
=============

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants)*

I recently ranted about [the conflation of "accessibility" and
"availability"].  In doing so, I found myself going off on a longer
diatribe about accessibility.  But that didn't belong in the musing.

I get it.  Accessibility is hard.  It takes effort to think
about those with differences in ability.  It takes extra time
time to make things more broadly accessible.  For example, while
captioning an educational video is relatively straightforward [3],
narrating a video is complex and may require multiple rounds of
feedback [4,5].  Some things may be impossible to make completely
accessible.  I wonder, for example, how people create versions of
time-based 3D visualizations, such as those from the [Hans Rosling TED
talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen).
Narrating the talk would be hard enough.  What if you had to put that
software in front of a student?



We should not ignore something because it's hard.  


Envision a time
in which someone you love has difficulty seeing, hearing, or moving.
Then try to design things so that your loved one can use (access) them.
You'll quickly realize that *availability is not accessibility*.

[5] More seriously, though, figuring out what needs to be narrated and
how to narrate it can be quite complex.  I recall watching the Harvard
CS50 videos and thinking about the need to read the code, to describe
what point in the code is currently highlighted, to intertwine that with
the words that the instructor is speaking, and to decide which additional
visual features are necessary for understanding.

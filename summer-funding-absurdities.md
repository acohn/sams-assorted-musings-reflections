Summer funding absurdities
==========================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), academia, short*

This summer, I've been thinking a lot about my work time.  I regularly
get asked to do things associated with my regular job at the College
and not with my summer research: Answer questions from advisees, write
recommendation letters, participate in committee work, and so on and
so forth.  With the new guidelines on summer compensation, I'm trying
to figure out what I am and am not allowed to do.  Suppose I receive
funding from the NSF and have other work to do, too.  Can I document 40
hours on my NSF project per week and then use the other time for other
activities?  The answer was "No".  It appears that I have to devote 100%
of my time to that activity.  So, if I worked 60 hours per week in June
and July and spent 40 hours of each month on my NSF project, that would
be considered one-and-a-third months of work.

Wow, that's stupid.  If seems like if I work 30 hours per week and spend
all of it on an NSF project, that's considered better than if I work 60
hours per week and spend 40 hours on an NSF project.  (Should I say "That
absurd beauracracy explains a lot about my president"?  Probably not.)
Even during the academic year, I'm allowed to spend some of my time on
other activities [1].

I wonder if I should check with my program officer [3].

[1] Maybe Grinnell includes those other activities as "service".
I'll admit that I do most as a volunteer.  But I do get a slight bit of
compensatioin if I, say, do an external review at another institution [2].

[2] I recall a time when I got a small honorarium to do tenure reviews.
I don't think those honoraria exist any more.

[3] It's not that I have an active NSF grant.  But I do know the program
officers in my disicpline.

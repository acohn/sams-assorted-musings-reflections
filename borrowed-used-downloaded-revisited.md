QUote from Harley

My first published story appeared in the North American Review in 1984. I was 23 years old and still an undergraduate. One day, I had to get something from my girlfriend who was in class, an English class. She came out into the hall with a funny look on her face. She said, "She's teaching your story in there." I looked through the door and saw that everyone had photocopies of my story. I didn't think about money. I felt a little dizzy at the realization that in a room where in a couple hours I would be taught Hemingway, students were being taught me. I think the honor of being part of the conversation gets lost in consideration of copyright. We write to communicate, and we shouldn't say, "Listen, I have something to say, and if you give me $5 I'll say it."

Dates and Deadlines (part of a letter to the incoming chair)
============================================================

_Just a little housekeeping left in [my letter to the incoming
chair](index-incoming-chair): dates, a manifest, a list things I forgot
to include in the first round of writing, and perhaps a one-page summary.
In this section, we consider some of the key dates and deadlines for
the chair._

---

While the Dean's office has a list of faculty dates to remember, that list
contains a number of events that are not immediately relevant to your role
as department chair.  It also lacks some regular events that are important
to the chair, but don't necessarily flow through the Dean's office.
Here are the ones that come to mind.  I recommend that you update it
as you get new requests.  I also recommend that you put deadlines on a
calendar or equivalent.  And pay attention to the Faculty News Digest.
Many important deadlines appear there.

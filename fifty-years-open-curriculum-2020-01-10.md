As I've noted before [1], the Fall of 2020 marks the fiftieth anniversary
of Grinnell's Open Curriculum and Tutorial.  This past summer, I
attempted to put together a group of folks to consider how we
might celebrate that anniversary.  The main conclusion of that group
was "Council, and perhaps even the Board of Trustees, should give a
charge to whatever group is organizing anniversary events".  I had
thought that Council would take it from there.

I was wrong.  Due to some miscommunication, it appears that Council
was waiting for a formal request.  Since the new semester is about
to commence, it seems timely to write that request now [2].  And,
as is my habit, I'm using a musing to draft that note.

Dear President Kington, Dean Harris, Chair Armstrong, and members of Council,

As you may know, the fall of 2020 marks the fiftieth anniversary
of the implementation of Grinnell's Individually Advised Curriculum
(also "Open Curriculum" and "No Requirements Curriculum") and the
Tutorial.  (We did offer a few tutorials in Spring 1970.)  It strikes
me that Grinnell should celebrate this anniversary in some meaningful
way, and perhaps even tie that celebration to the College's current
attempts to define a 21st Century Liberal Education as well as the
175th Anniversary of the founding of the College.

A number of approaches are possible.  For example, we might have a
symposium that looks backwards and forwards on topics of liberal
education, we might prepare a volume of articles about the Grinnell
curriculum of the past and the future, we might incorporate activities
in reunion events, or we might offer a set of linked Tutorials on
these topics.  Most likely, we would want to celebrate this anniversary
in multiple ways.

Brown University, which instituted an Open Curriculum at about the
same time as Grinnell, is currently celebrating the 50th anniversary
of their Open Curriculum with a variety of activities, including
talks, reunion events, interviews, and more.  See
<https://www.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/open-curriculum/50> for
details.  I believe Jim Swartz attended a symposium on that Open
Curriculum last spring.

This past summer, I attempted to put together an informal working
group to do some preliminary planning.  The general consensus of
that working group was that a multi-day symposium required too much
planning, but that a general framework to which other activities
might be tied would be appropriate.  It was also noted that the
charge for the Grinnell Sesquicentennial came from the Board of
Trustees, along with significant funding for the associated activities.

The group concluded that it was not comfortable moving ahead with
further planning as the charge for such an event should really come
from Council or the Trustees and that the selection of members for
the Task Force charged with designing the celebration also belonged
to Council and the College Administration.

Hence, I request that Council and the College create a Task Force
to develop an appropriate celebration of Tutorial and the Individually
Advised Curriculum, perhaps tied to our discussions of Liberal Arts
in the 21st Century or the College's Demisemiseptcentennial.  While
the membership of the Task Force is your purview, I would suggest
that the Task Force include current faculty (including a member of
the Tutorial and Advising Committee), members of Communications and
DAR, other staff, alumni, and perhaps a representative of the Board
of Trustees.  I also suggest that you contact that Board of Trustees
to get buy-in (and, perhaps, financial support) for the event.

We only have one opportunity to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary.
Let's do it right.

Okay.  The draft is done.  Now I need to let it stew for a bit.
I'll send out a revised version to the appropriate folks on Monday.
If you happen to have any comments, send them my way.

Postscript: I see that there was a message in my inbox about a related
matter that I completely missed.  I really do need to work at getting 
back to inbox zero.

Postscript: While I'm hoping that we call the 175th anniversary the
demisemiseptcentennial, it appears that Communications has chosen
to call it the terquasquicentennial.

Postscript: During my visit to the College Archives today, I was
able to verify that the logs in old College Catalogs use 1848 rather
than 1846 [3].  I wonder when we switched from using the date we were
incorporated to using the date we first offered classes [4].  I find
it interesting that the University of Chicago made the same change,
albeit more recently [5].

[1] Or at least as I recall noting before.

[2] I probably should have written it last semester.

[3] More precisely, MDCCCXLVIII rather than MDCCCXLVI.

[4] At least I think that's what the two dates represent.

[5] When I was at Chicago, they used 1892.  Now they use 1890.

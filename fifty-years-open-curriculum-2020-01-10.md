As I've noted before [1], the Fall of 2020 marks the fiftieth anniversary
of Grinnell's Open Curriculum and Tutorial.  This past summer, I
had attempted to put together a group of folks to consider how we
might celebrate the anniversary.  The main conclusion of that group
was "Council and perhaps even the Board of Trustees should give a 
charge to whatever group is organizing anniversary events".  I had
thought that Council would take it from there.

I was wrong.  Due to some miscommunication, it appears that Council was
waiting for a note from me.  Since the new semester is about to commence,
it seems timely to write the note.  And, as is my habit, I'm using a
musing to draft that note.

Dear President Kington, Dean Harris, Chair Armstrong, and members of Council,

As you may know, the fall of 2020 marks the fiftieth anniversary
of the implementation of Grinnell's Individually Advised Curriculum
(also "Open Curriculum" and "No Requirements Curriculum") and the
Tutorial.  It strikes me that Grinnell should celebrate this
anniversary in some meaningful way, and perhaps even tie that
celebration to the College's current attempts to define a 21st
Century Liberal Education as well as the 175th Anniversary of the
founding of the College.

A number of approaches are possible.  For example, we might have a
symposium that looks backwards and forwards on topics of liberal
education, we might prepare a volume of articles about the Grinnell
curriculum of the past and the future, we might incorporate activities
in reunion events, and we might offer a set of linked Tutorials on
these topics.

Brown University, which instituted an Open Curriculum at about the
same time as Grinnell, is currently celebrating the 50th anniversary
of their Open Curriculum with a variety of activities, including
talks, reunion events, interviews, and more.  See
<https://www.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/open-curriculum/50> for
more information.  I believe Jim Swartz attended a symposium on
that Open Curriculum last spring.

This past summer, I attempted to put together an informal working
group to do some preliminary planning.  The general consensus of
that working group was that a multi-day symposium required too much
planning, but that a general framework to which other activities
might be tied would be appropriate.  It was also noted that the
charge for the Grinnell Sesquicentennial came from the Board of
Trustees, along with significant funding for the associated activities.

The group concluded that it was not comfortable moving ahead with
further planning as the charge for such an event should really come
fromCouncil or the Trustees and that the selection of members for
the Task Force charged with designing the celebration belonged to
Council and the College Administration.

I request that Council and the College create a Task Force to develop
an appropriate celebration of Tutorial and the Individually Advised
Curriculum, perhaps tied to our discussions of Liberal Arts in the
21st Century or the College's Demisemiseptcentennial.  While the
membership of the Task Force is your purview, I would suggest that
the Task Force include current faculty (including a member of the
Tutorial and Advising Committee), members of Communications and
DAR, other staff, alumni, and perhaps a representative of the Board
of Trustees.  I also suggest that you contact that Board of Trustees
to get buy-in (and perhaps financial support) for the event.

We only have one opportunity for a fiftieth-anniversary celebration.
Let's do it right.

Okay.  The draft is done.  Now I need to let it stew for a bit.
I'll send out a revised version to the appropriate folks on Monday.
If you happen to have any comments, send them my way.

Postscript: I see that there was a message in my inbox about a related
matter that I completely missed.  I really do need to work at getting 
back to inbox zero.

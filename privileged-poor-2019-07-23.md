Reading _The Privileged Poor_
=============================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia)*

One of the many things I appreciate about Grinnell is that it sponsors
occasional readng groups for faculty or faculty and staff [1].  Participating
in reading groups gives me the ng opportunity to think in new ways, to encounter
the ideas of my brilliant colleagues, and, at times, to get insight that
would be difficult to get elseiwhere [2].

This summer, a group is reading [_The Privileged
Poor: How Elite Colleges Are Failing Disadvantaged
Students_](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674976894).
Those on campus can read [a
PDF](http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=2007526).
The Dean's office also purchased some printed copies [3].  We had one
meeting last week and we'll have a second meeting tomorrow.  I thought
it would be useful to get some notes down before the second 
conversation [5].

The central thesis of the first two chapters makes somewhat intuitive
sense: While all low-SES [6] students face challenges at elite
colleges having to do with the lack of "social capital", as it were,
the "privileged poor", those who also went to elite high schools,
most typically on scholarships, face fewer challenges that the "doubly
disadvantaged", those who did not.  For example, the privileged poor
are less likely to be stunned at the excesses of the high-SES students
and therefore less likely to feel like outsiders.  More importantly,
the privileged poor are typically more comfortable relying on resources
at the institution and more knowledgeable about those resources.

Anthony Abraham Jack, the author, observed this behavior when he was an
undergraduate at Amherst and conducted his research with students as a
school he calls "Renowned" and which I'm told is most likely Harvard.
While I think the thesis makes sense, his description of these
schools seems quite foreign to me.  Why?  It's a variety of things.
Most importantly, my sense is that Grinnell has a comparatively small
population of students who went to elite prep schools [7], whether
privileged poor or wealthy whatevers.  Grinnell students generally
seem to lack the clear sense of privilege that the wealthy students
at Renowned seem to have.  I don't hear many discussions about flying
abroad or see public displays of wealth in coats and purses and weekend
getaways and such.

Grinnell also tries hard to ameliorate differences in privilege [8].
I appreciate that we don't charge for concerts, athletic events,
dances [9], or such.  I appreciate that when things have required
fees, like the Met opera or some NCAA events, the College finds a
way to make sure that students are paid for.  I appreciate that we
don't charge our athletes for letter jackets [10], that we fund most
of the cost for course-embedded travel [11], artistic trips [12],
and athletic trips [14].

But that doesn't mean that the book doesn't have implications for a place
like Grinnell.  There are still many advantages, implicit and explicit,
to those with privilege.  Sometimes it's something as simple as knowing
that it's okay to ask a professor whether or not the bundled software
that comes with a book is required [15].  There are also a variety of
expecations that it's easy to come up with a "small" amount of money,
whether it's $10 for a department t-shirt [16] or "just a few bucks"
for supplies for a party or a gift for a peer.  I realize those may
seem like small things.  But like many small things, they can build up.

Postscript: What's next?  This fall, some of us are reading Kate Manne's
_Down Girl_ in advance of her talk on campus.

[1] I also appreciate that it's become more inclusive; where once we had
faculty-only reading groups, such as the Faculty Weekend Seminar, most
reading groups are now for both faculty and staff.

[2] One highlight was reading a Stephen Ambrose book, almost certainly
_Citizen Soldiers_, with Ken Christiansen.

[3] I had originally requested one of the printed copies.  However, I've
since purchased an iPad [4], so I have a spare printed copy for the first
to claim them.

[4] A potential topic for future musings.

[5] I had originally planned this musing as an excuse to think about
the last chapter; I expect that will be a future musing.

[6] Socio-economic status.

[7] A sense that I think was confirmed by folks from admissions.

[8] Or at least it tries.

[9] The book suggests that for many students, a $7 dance was reasonable
but a $10 dance was excessive.

[10] Or at least I don't think we do.

[11] I realize that "most" doesn't cut it for everyone.  I hope that
we have a way to support for those who can't easily come up with the
extra.

[12] The child of a colleague is going to another elite institution;
I'm told that the spring break trip for their singing group was much
more expensive than ours.

[14] My primary experience is with Swimming and Diving.  Students don't
pay for their uniforms and don't pay for their competition trips.  Families
are asked to contribute to the cost of the winter break trip to Florida.
I had recalled that the message said something like "We understand that
not everyone can contribute", but, upon review, I see that it doesn't.
It should.

[15] I recall writing to one of my kid's professors to ask just that
question because the used copy was more than $100 cheaper, but didn't
include the software.  I mentioned this in a discussion about ways to
deal with textbook costs and one of the students there said "I took that
course; I wish I'd known."  I was surprised, because I thought of this
student as someone who had lots of social capital on campus; I learned
later that they were first-gen.

[16] I mentioned that issue a few years ago.  An anonymous donor now 
offers to pay for shirts for those who want them and can't afford it.

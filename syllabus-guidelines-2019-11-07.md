Further reflections on syllabus guidelines
==========================================

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), follow-ups*

The other day, I ranted a bit about [a sequence of proposed changes
to the _Faculty Handbook_ involving guidelines for preparing
course syllabi](syllabus-guidelines-2019-11-03).  I don't mind
receiving guidelines as suggestions; I just mind being told that I
have to follow those guidelines, particularly when I don't agree
with all of them, or find that some of them contradict what I've
found to be successful practices.  And, as I noted in that prior musing,
I really don't like hearing things described as "best practices", since
I always wonder "best practices for who?" [1].

As one might expect, there was a lot of pushback from the faculty
at the meeting, not least about the vague "in compliance with federal
regulations" in the draft handbook language.  I'd raised the question
about the particular regulations in advance of the meeting and
others continued to raise it during the meeting.  While there is
agreement among the faculty and the Dean's office that there's a
need for a clear summary of the relevant regulations, no one was
able to come up with that summary at the meeting, or even to identify
all of the relevant regulations.  For example, the Americans with
Disabilities Act applies to how we teach, in that we must make
reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities.
However, that does not mean that we have to make our accommodations
policy part of our syllabus [2] to adhere to the ADA.  The Higher
Education Opportunity Act's textbook information provision usually
affects when we select the textbooks that appear on our syllabus,
but that timing is not covered in the guidelines.  Title IX
can be relevant to a syllabus, mostly in terms of how we deal with
Title IX incidents [3].  So, in the end, the current answer is "We need
to work more on documenting the relevant regulations."

More importantly, I learned a lot about some additional rationales
for changing the _Handbook_ from friends, alumni, and colleagues [4]
who commented on my musing on Facebook.

One of the first things I learned was that "best practices" was
intended to mean something more like "research-informed practices" or, as one
person suggested, "a systematic evidence-based set of recommendations”.
I appreciate the correction, and hope that the next version of the
proposal will replace "best practices" with "evidence-based practices"
or "research-based practices".  I also hope that the next version
of the guidelines provides explicit reference to the evidence or
research study [5].

More importantly, I learned that it's important to have policies because
not all faculty are responsible about creating syllabi.  As one person
noted,

> [When I worked with a group of students on workload issues], I was *shocked* at how many students experienced receiving partial syllabi, few or no due dates, due dates moved earlier (later is understandable), entire books not on the syllabus assigned mid-semester, and syllabi not turned in in time to be made accessible. I thought I had a good sense of things, but apparently not. Even our students who wish to plan well cannot without complete syllabi, and it seemed surprisingly uncommon for students to have four solid syllabi. I found that extremely disappointing for an institution that values teaching as much as Grinnell does.

I've had more luck when I've worked with my Tutorial students on
semester planning.  Of course, it's also been ten years since I taught
Tutorial, so things may have changed.  But if we have a large
number of faculty who are not giving students clear guidelines on major
pieces of work, it's essential that we have policies to ensure that
faculty provide those guidelines.  Of course, that requires that someone
in the Dean's office read over the submitted syllabi.  I'm not sure
whether or not that will happen in practice.

It's also the case that for some courses, it may not be possible
to provide a full syllabus in advance.  For example, one colleague
discussed a course that involved a lot of collaboration with external
entities, and it was not possible to set up all of those
collaborations in advance.  But those situations are more the
exception than the rule.  And, even in those cases, it should be
possible to give students some sense of typical workload and major
due dates.

I had suggested that we clarify how the syllabi would be used.  Checking
that there are due dates and such is one use beyond accreditation.  But
there are others.  Another colleague noted that,

> The Residential Learning Task Force recommended a syllabus study as one part of looking at student workload and other issues largely related to student wellness. 

They also noted that the study is planned and that the proposed collection
mechanism will provide the data.  That makes sense to me.  However, it 
sounds like I'm the only one who has raised the issue of limiting the
use of syllabi that the Dean's office collects [6].  I don't plan to raise
the issue again.

An alum noted that they often used syllabi not only to gauge the
content and workload of a course, but also the worldview of the
faculty member.  I certainly subscribe to that perspective.  I use
custom language about accommodation to suggest that I address
accommodations and adjustments as an ethical issue and not just a
legal obligation.  And, as I've noted before, I do make adjustments
for students that go beyond legal accommodations.  The alum also
looks at attendance guidelines, policies for late work, and other
similar issues.  They don't look for a particular set of policies,
but rather use them to try to understand whether it's a faculty
member who tends to be lenient or one who tends to be strict, which
affects how they approach the class [7].

So, where do I stand on all of this?  I'd like to see a revised set of
syllabus design guidelines that include clear references to the evidence
for practices or the federal regulations the practices support.  I'd
like to see _Handbook_ language that does not use the term "best
practices".  I'd like clearer documentation of the related federal
regulations.  But the most important thing seems to be that we have
policies in place to help ensure that our students get accessible,
usable, and useful syllabi at the start of the semester.  I'll
likely support proposed language that gets us to that place.

[1] One reader pointed me [an article in _McSweeney's_ about best
practices in academia](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/how-to-practice-best-practices-a-guide-for-faculty).

[2] I include an "accommodations and adjustments" policy in all of my
syllabi.  

[3] I would hope that in this day and age, faculty would not write syllabi
that interfere with students' educational opportunities based on the gender
of those students.

[4] And combinations thereof.

[5] I will admit that I want to see the references, in part, because
I find that the evidence used is often gathered in a very different
environment (e.g., large lecture classes or classes with auto-graders)
and may not be directly applicable to what we do.

[6] Or maybe we just ran out of time.

[7] As far as I can tell, they don't necessarily approach the two kinds
of classes differently.  That is, more strict policies don't necessarily
lead to more or better work.  But they mean that students prioritize
getting work for one class in before class for another.

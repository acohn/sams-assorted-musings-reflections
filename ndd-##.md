Nibbled to death by ducks - Episode two
=======================================

*This essay will appear some time in the future.*

*Notes:*

It's morning.  Let's look at the things I'm trying to balance.  I should
read through my email (about 50 messages since I went to bed).  I should
plan today's department meeting.  I should send followup email to the Dean
about our search.  I should send followup email to HR about hiring
processes.  I should prepare my classes for today.  I should review a
colleagues' work for our .  I should send out a message about Learning
from Alumni.  I should critique my CoA student work.  I should do a
video for CoA.  Oh, and I should update my to-do list so I don't forget
about the dozens of other things I need to keep track of.  Bleh.

It's not that any of these things is all that hard, or perhaps even that
time consuming.  It's that there are so many of them, and they keep
coming in.

Hmmm ... I wonder if my emails make other people feel the same way.  I'll
have to think about that.

Grinnell's Board of Trustees
============================

As I think I mentioned recently, when I was a young faculty member I
developed a somewhat negative perspective of the Trustees.  Many seemed to
have joined because they were interested in helping manage the endowment
(or having helping manage the endowment on their résumés) rather than
because they were interested in helping the College.  A number of things
effected [1] my perspective (and, at times, continue to effect [2] my
perspective on the Trustees of the time), including:

* What appeared to be a strong push for the awesome [Pamela
  Ferguson](pamela-ferguson.html) to step down as president.  That's a
  fairly stunning thing to have happen when you are a young faculty
  member.
* The hiring of [Russell K. Osgood](russell-k-osgood.html) as 
  president.  I will admit that I came to like and even admire Russell.
  However, there were serious questions about his "fit" at Grinnell,
  and I heard at least one faculty member say that if he were president,
  they would not feel comfortable voicing public complaints about the
  institution.
* An irresponsible lack of emphasis on development.
* The imposition of what seemed to be business practices on a College.
  These included bullet-point lists [3] rather than thoughtful paragraphs;
  the use of buzzwords like "excellence"; the "branding" of the College
  with the awful "No Limits" [4]; and the attempt to summarize the
  success of the College with a dashboard.
* A statement of the form "We'd know that Grinnell was being successful
  if it produced more investment bankers."
* That horrid bullet-point list for our [mission
  statement](grinnells-mission-statement.html).
* The development of the JRC.  There are so many issues with the JRC.
  We hired an architect who doesn't like clocks.  (Haven't you wondered
  why there are no clocks in the building?)  In contrast to Noyce, in
  which we paid particular attention to being reasonable environmental
  stewards, such as by trying to source materials locally, the JRC sourced
  stone from around the world (bringing some of it on the both figurative
  and literal slow boat from China).  The placement of the lecture hall
  (JRC 101) as far as possible from the handicapped parking and the
  provision of too little handicapped parking.  The use of a strange
  parquet in that lecture hall, a parquet that clearly is not designed
  to withstand the use it gets.  The use of woks in the Marketplace,
  rather than a circular grill, even though woks require significantly
  more water to clean. The list goes on and on.  "Form over function",
  as they say.  I don't mean to imply that we didn't need a building like
  the JRC; we did.  I don't mean to imply that I don't like many features
  of the JRC; I do.  But it could have been so much better, and so much
  more environmentally responsible.
* My post-tenure dinner with the Trustees.  I have no memory of what we
  talked about.  What I do remember is that they had just raised 
  tuition and fees by about 10%, and we had gold leaf on the dessert.
  There seemed to be an incredible disconnect.
* Nord Brue's talk at the dedication of the JRC [5], which went something
  like "Students come and go.  Faculty come and go.  Only Trustees have a
  long-term sense of the institution."  Yeah, Nord.  Tell that to Henry
  Walker, George Drake, Jon Andelson, Elizabeth Dobbs, the McClellands,
  the Moores, the Hunters, and oh so many more long-term faculty who
  remain connected to the institution.
* The development of the Bear and the Natatorium.  Now, I know that these
  are awesome spaces, and spaces from which we clearly benefit.
  But we delayed (and continue to delay) the construction of needed
  academic spaces.  And we built the Bear and the Natatorium without
  making sure that we had donations to help cover them.  Guess what?
  People don't like to donate to support an already-constructed building
  [6].  And that's going to have an effect on the College budget when
  the balloon payments come due.
* The East Campus dorms which, while beautiful, have their own problems.
  There are rooms in which the expected furnishings don't fit in any
  sensible way [7].  
* A fascinating talk by Jim Collins, who was in the process of writing
  _Good to Great_ [8].  In the question and answer session after the talk,
  I said something about Grinnell already being great [9] and it was
  clear from their responses that the Trustees who had invited Collins
  to talk did not think we were great.
* The construction of an Admissions center that is clearly not suited
  for Admissions.  Why did we build that center?  Because Trustees were
  interested in having a distinguished architect, rather than exploring
  those needs carefully [10].

Is it any wonder that as a faculty member, I didn't trust the Trustees?

But now that I've been at Grinnell for nearly two decades, I've had
the opportunity to meet with some trustees, some of them for extended
periods of time.  I've had dinners with them

---

[1] Yes, I mean "effected" and not "affected".  These experiences led to
my perspective.

[2] In this case, I do mean "effect", in the sense that they change how
I think about Trustees.

[3] Yes, I realize that I'm also writing a bullet-point list.  At least
I'm writing full sentences.

[4] I've always preferred "Know Limits".

[5] A talk in front of a wall of expensive imported stone.

[6] I'm glad that we're building the HSSC.  It's clearly needed.  But I
worry that once again, we're building it without having the funds in hand.
Didn't we learn the first time?

[7] I'm pretty sure that folks looked at square footage in the rooms,
but didn't pay attention to the actual furniture that was supposed to
fit or the arc of the roof.

[8] I even have a signed copy of a manuscript of part of the book.

[9] It is.

[10] I've learned about issues with Admissions in recent years when I asked
why we have decided to build another Admissions Center.  These issues were
not part of my early experiences with the Trustees.

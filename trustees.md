Grinnell's Board of Trustees
============================

As I think I mentioned recently, when I was a young faculty member I
developed a somewhat negative perspective of the Trustees.  Many seemed to
have joined because they were interested in helping manage the endowment
(or having helping manage the endowment on their résumés) rather than
because they were interested in helping the College.  A number of things
effected [1] my perspective (and, at times, continue to effect [2]) my
perspective on the Trustees of the time.  Because of those things [3],
I did not really trust the Trustees.

But now that I've been at Grinnell for nearly two decades, I've had
the opportunity to meet with more trustees, some of them for extended
conversations.  I've had dinners and other meetings with them in a
variety of roles in which I serve or served, including as Chair of the
Science Division, as a member of our Expanding Knowledge Initiative [4]
task force, as a faculty member in the Science Division, and as a member
of the Wilson Committee.  There may be others; those are just the
ones that come to mind.

Perhaps the most important things I've learned are that (a) while, from
the outside, it seems like the Trustees speak with one voice, when you
talk to them individually, you find that they each have their own unique
perspective; (b) many of our Trustees care deeply about the College
[5]; (c) some of our Trustees spend a significant amount of time on the
College, each week, not just when they are on campus; and (d) the Trustees
really do have to think about things that the faculty and students don't
need to think about regularly, such as the College's liability for different
things.

And I've met a number of amazing and thoughtful Trustees.  I probably
can't create a full list, but they include Patricia Jipp Finkleman '80,
Hal Fuson, Jr. '67, Atul Gupta '88, Sylvia Kwan, Joel Spiegel '78',
David White '90, and even Clint Korver '89 [6].  Plus, there are three
folks from town who serve on the board who I respect greatly, including
Angela Onwuachi-Willig '94, Laura Ferguson '90, and Todd Linden

So, whenever I get frustrated with the Trustees, or what seem to be
decisions by the Trustees, I do my best to remember that many of them
are awesome people who we are fortunate to have looking out for the best
interests of the College.  I also do my best to think of them as 
individuals, rather than as a whole.  Maybe when I start writing profiles,
I'll profile a few of them.

---

[1] Yes, I mean "effected" and not "affected".  These experiences led to
my perspective.

[2] In this case, I do mean "effect", in the sense that they change how
I think about Trustees.

[3] Michelle sensibly suggested that I excise my too-long and too-detailed
list.

[4] EKI, for those of you keeping track of our TLAs.

[5] The Trustees that care deeply about the College include Trustees
who were not Grinnell undergraduates.

[6] I appreciate many things that Clint does for Grinnell.  I don't
always agree with his approaches.  Clint also does wonderful things
one-on-one with folks.  I particularly appreciate the mentoring he did
for [Megan Goering '08] and his bringing Sylvia Kwan to the board.

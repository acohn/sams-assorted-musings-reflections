We've reached the end of another month and, as is my wont [1], I'm
using the last day of the month to look back on the past month and
reflect on the musings.  I might consider distribution of topics,
things I've learned about my writing, simple data, and similar
issues.  I write these end-of-month musings for myself, but some
others seem to find them worth reading [2].  I'll admit that I
sometimes find myself challenged to write the first paragraph of
these musings since I've written similar paragraphs before [3].

Data

What does my sketchbook look like?

* I have N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need minor revisions"
* I have another N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need major
  revisions".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Short".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Long".

Final thoughts

[1] No, that's not the same as "won't".

[2] I guess that's true of most of my musings and rants.

[3] Hey, that's a good topic for a musing: "How do I introduce my end-of-month
musings?"  I'll add it to the list.

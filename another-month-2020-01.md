We've reached the end of another month and, as is my wont [1], I'm
using the last day of the month to look back on the past month and
reflect on the musings.  I might consider distribution of topics,
things I've learned about my writing, simple data, and similar
issues.  I write these end-of-month musings for myself, but some
others seem to find them worth reading [2].  I'll admit that I
sometimes find myself challenged to write the first paragraph of
these musings since I've written similar paragraphs before [3].

On my writing
-------------

First few musings of the month (year) were quite long.  The first,
on [my plans for my next Tutorial](next-tutorial-2020-01-01) had a
lot of quoted material that added to its length.  The second, [my
post-preregistration reflections](post-prereg-2020S), required me
to write about a bunch of data.  I'm not sure that I wrote all that
much meaningful, but it took a lot of time and resulted in a lot
of text.  Later in the month, I wrote a third very-long musing,
this time on [staff governance](governance-tenure-2020-01-19).  As
I noted in one of the too-many postscripts to the last musing,
I doubt that I'll have too many "lazy Sunday afternoons" in which
I can write musings that are 4000-5000 words long.

Follow-ups to individual musings

Broader issues 
--------------

I’ve continued my practice of saving musings additional musings
that I mostly finish on a day that I’ve already posted a musing,
rather than posting them as a second [or third] musing.  However,
I’ve discovered a disadvantage to that approach. In the past, when
I had an idea for a short musing, I’d put a few notes in my sketchbook
and leave it at that.  Now, I feel much more comfortable writing a
full draft.  But that takes much more of my time, so I’m not sure
that it’s the best idea. Oh well, I guess that’s how things go.

I did have one day in which I considered posting four separate
musings related to donating to Grinnell, [some general comments on
donation], [followup notes on the _Honor Roll of Giving_], [a letter
to concerned alums regarding project ignite], and [a fantasy about
donations in my name].  But I decided that I would be better off
posting them on separate days.

I got very few comments on [my musing on Tutorial
topics](next-tutorial-2020-01-01).  Given the number I'd previously
received on [Plans], I found that somewhat surprising.  I guess
[Plans] is just a better social media site. I suppose I should return.

Behind the scenes

Data
----

What does my sketchbook look like?

* I have N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need minor revisions"
* I have another N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need major
  revisions".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Short".  
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Long".  

Looking ahead

Final thoughts
--------------

---

[1] No, that's not the same as "won't".

[2] I guess that's true of most of my musings and rants.

[3] Hey, that's a good topic for a musing: "How do I introduce my end-of-month
musings?"  I'll add it to the list.

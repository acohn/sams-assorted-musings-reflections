We've reached the end of another month and, as is my wont [1], I'm
using the last day of the month to look back on the past month and
reflect on the musings.  I might consider distribution of topics,
things I've learned about my writing, simple data, and similar
issues.  I write these end-of-month musings for myself, but some
others seem to find them worth reading [2].  I'll admit that I
sometimes find myself challenged to write the first paragraph of
these musings since I've written similar paragraphs before [3].

On my writing
-------------

First few musings of the month (year) were quite long.  The first,
on [my plans for my next Tutorial](next-tutorial-2020-01-01) had a
lot of quoted material that added to its length.  The second, [my
post-preregistration reflections](post-prereg-2020S), required me
to write about a bunch of data.  I'm not sure that I wrote all that
much meaningful, but it took a lot of time and resulted in a lot
of text.  Later in the month, I wrote a third very-long musing,
this time on [staff governance](governance-tenure-2020-01-19).  As
I noted in one of the too-many postscripts to the last musing,
I doubt that I'll have too many "lazy Sunday afternoons" in which
I can write musings that are 4000-5000 words long.  And I probably
shouldn't spend so much time musing when [I have so much else to
do](semester-onslaught-2020-01-14).  I also wonder whether I need
a "TL;DR" section or to break the larger musings up into shorter
musings.

Still write "really" and "clearly" too much, at least according to
Grammarly.  Frequently comma splice before or and and.  Not sure
why.

About to learn a lot more on how to write.

On posting frequency
--------------------

Managed to post every day.  Yay!  Or at least I remember posting every
day.

Timeliness: Weekly report and notes for Ralph's class?

Thought I might have one or two other days in which I posted more than
one, but did not.  More on that later.

Follow-ups to individual musings
--------------------------------

No one commented on my [musing on staff
governance](governance-tenure-2020-01-19).  I wonder why.

I got very few comments on [my musing on Tutorial
topics](next-tutorial-2020-01-01).  Given the number I'd previously
received on [Plans], I found that somewhat surprising.  I guess
[Plans] is just a better social media site. I suppose I should
consider returning.

A missed opportunity
--------------------

The day after I posted [my thousandth musing](musing-1000), a colleague
at a meeting with me said something like,

> I was at the Faculty/Staff Friday last week.  I asked why you were
running the session, given that you're on leave.  Two people at my
table said "He's written at least two ramblings about it."

"Ramblings".  I like that.  It's a bit insulting.  But it's true.

If I'd heard that before I posted musing 1000, I could have made
the decision to change the name of the pieces I write from "musings"
to "ramblings" and called musing 1000 "my last musing".  Then I
could have renamed the collection from "SamR's Assorted Musings and
Rants" to "Rebelsky Rambles and Rants".  I like the alliteration.
Perhaps I could have done "Rebelsky Regularly Rambles and Rants"
or "Rebelsky Repeatedly Rambles and Rants" or "Rebelsky Randomly
Rambles and Rants" or, just because that's not enough "R"s, "Rebelsky
Regularly, Repeatedly, and Randomly Rambles and Rants"..  What else?
Oh, Grammarly hates it when I use "really".  I'd almost certainly
have to call it "Rebelsky Regularly, Repeatedly, and Randomly Really
Rambles and Rants".

Maybe it's good that I didn't hear it earlier.  I'll stick with the
current title.  Plus, I appreciate that the various spelling and
grammar checkers keep telling me to convert "a musing" to "amusing".

Broader issues
--------------

I’ve continued my practice of saving additional musings that I
mostly finish on a day that I’ve already posted a musing, rather
than posting them as a second [or third] musing.  However, I’ve
discovered a disadvantage to that approach. In the past, when I had
an idea for a short musing, I’d put a few notes in my sketchbook
and leave it at that.  Now, I feel much more comfortable writing a
full draft.  But that takes much more of my time, so I’m not sure
that it’s the best idea. Oh well, I guess that’s how things go.

I did have one day in which I considered posting four separate
musings related to donating to Grinnell, [some general comments on
donation], [followup notes on the _Honor Roll of Giving_], [a letter
to concerned alums regarding project ignite], and [a fantasy about
donations in my name].  But I decided that I would be better off
posting them on separate days.  I never did get to the last one.

I feel like my musings have been having indirect impacts, although
not ones that I intended.  I posted about GrinCam.  GrinCam went
away.  I mentioned the online list of courses.  Suddenly it required
a password  to access the list of courses.  I like to pretend that
I've also had some more positive (and perhaps intentional) indirect
impacts, like the time I suggested we offer someone a tenure-line
position, and we did.  But these indirect impacts are strange.

Behind the scenes
-----------------

Data
----

What does my sketchbook look like?  As I mentioned [at the end of
last month](another-month-2019-12), I set aside my sketchbook from
last year and started fresh, so these are all issues that came to
mind since the start of the year [4].

* I have N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need minor revisions"
* I have another N (N) musings that I've marked as "written, need major
  revisions".
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Short".
* I have N (N) planned musings that I've marked as "Long".
* I have N (N) planned musings about Grinnellians.  Right now, the list
  includes [Rachel Rose '01](cool-friends-2020-01-26) and Kate Walker.
  But this may be a case
  in which I'll look back to prior sketchbooks.  If you want to see
  either of those musings, or a musing about another Grinnellian, let
  me know. I may not follow your suggestion, but suggestions do help
  me move forward.

Looking ahead

Final thoughts
--------------

---

[1] No, that's not the same as "won't".

[2] I guess that's true of most of my musings and rants.

[3] Hey, that's a good topic for a musing: "How do I introduce my end-of-month
musings?"  I'll add it to the list.

[4] Perhaps also the last few days of last year.

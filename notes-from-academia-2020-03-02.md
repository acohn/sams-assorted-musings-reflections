I start most days by reading a bit of the news from academia.  Two
of the primary sources for such news, [_Inside Higher Ed_] and [_The
Chronicle of Higher Education_], send me daily digests at about
3am.  If I wake up in the middle of the night and can't easily fall
back asleep (which happens much too frequently), they provide me
with a useful distraction.  If I haven't worken up in the middle of
the night, they provide a way to kick off my workday.

I'm not quite sure why I enjoy reading the academic news.  In part,
it's because it's my broader community and can help shape my
understanding of that community and inform my own actions [1].  In
part, it's because it reminds me that, in spite of all my complaints,
I'm incredibly fortunate to be at Grinnell.  In part, I just like
to know things.  I also read the _New York Times_ app right before
bed.

I assume that most of my readers do not regularly read about higher
education [2].  And so I thought I'd share a few recent bits of news,
along with my reactions to them.  Since the UC Santa Cruz TA strike
has already hit the national news, I'm pretty sure that I can skip
over that one.

Ben Franklin course.

Washington story about Japanese Internment.

[1] You might think it would convince me not to be so public about my 
concerns about Grinnell.  You'd be wrong.

[2] There are, of course, exceptions.  I think, in particular, of a 
colleague in the building next door who regularly posts to Facebook
articles from the two sources I just mentioned.

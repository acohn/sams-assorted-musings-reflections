When I think about the creative aspects of my life and career (e.g.,
art, musing, programming, teaching, scholarship), I struggle to
figure out how best to balance what I think of as *creating* and
*consuming*.  That is, what portion of my time should I spend making
my own works and what portion should I spend looking at and reflecting
on the works of others?  My end goal is to create.  But I know that
I will create better when informed by careful study of the works
of others.

Of course, it's more complicated than that.  Rather than just two
C's, there are probably at least five P's: Should one produce,
practice, ponder (a better word than consume), perfect (well, make
better), or even just play (such as to learn something new)?  I
tend to fall more on the create side (or produce and play, when I
consider all five).  I'd often rather muse than read, program than
read a program, conduct research than read research papers, sculpt
or design sculpture rather than look at or read about sculpture,
start something new than revisit something I've created already.
That doesn't mean that I don't read, or visit museums, or read
scholarly papers, or perform some etudes for programmers.  I gain
joy from exploring the works of others, but, in practice, I tilt
more toward the "create" side [1].

Ralph Savarese's syllabus for _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_
shares a tip about these issues.

> Thirty-four years in the classroom has taught me that creative
writing courses need to focus primarily on exemplary models. By
practicing what we discern, we can begin the process of not only
finding our own voices but also producing noteworthy work. This is
the enabling paradox of art: originality comes from deeply absorbing
and re-constellating the achievements of others.

Now that's a great title for something: _The Enabling Paradox of
Art_.  Perhaps, someday, I'll be able to write a piece that lives
up to it.  For now, I'll continue to struggle with the choices.

Note that Ralph writes, "deeply absorbing", which I've rephrased
as "pondering".  You don't just glance at a work to learn from it.
You delve into it deeply, consider the crevices, explore the edges,
tease out the things that make it special.  Perhaps you even find
a few flaws.  After all, no work is perfect.  Or at least almost
no work.  I'm also reminded of what Jeremy Chen told me about
visiting museums; rather than trying to explore all of the work,
you should find a few pieces with which you engage deeply.  I'm not
always able to follow Jeremy's advice, but I try.  And when I succeed,
I find that it's been worth my while.

There are times that it feels right to engage with a group of works,
rather than an individual work.  After visiting Elias Sime's
_Tightrope_ exhibit [2], I felt myself compelled to return again to
consider the different aspect ratios he used, the recycled media
he chose for different pieces, how he aligned the panels (in a grid
or offset, as with bricks; horizontally or vertically).  Was I
exploring technique as much as the works themselves?  Probably.
But part of the goal of deeply absorbing a work is to understand
some of those techniques [3], even if you won't necessarily apply them.

And then there's the whole issue of practicing, doing work not to produce
a final piece, but to improve your skills.  I know that I should go through
_The Art of Styling Sentences_ and practice each of the sentence patterns,
if only to familiarize myself with those patterns [4].  I sometimes write
programs just to learn a new language, which isn't quite the same thing.
And I know that it's good practice for a visual artist to replicate some
extant works to better understand how they work and to develop skills.

So how should I balance it all?  I'm not sure.  With more free time, I
might be better.  I might schedule an hour each day to read and reflect
on appropriate kinds of nonfiction [4], an hour to experiment with my
writing, an hour to practice different sentence structures, an hour
to muse, and an hour to write something more serious.  And that's just
for the writing!  There's also scholarship, sculpture, teaching, and
more.  But I rarely feel like I have the mental energy for one extra hour
each day, let alone the five for writing, or the however-many for all of
the above.  And so I'm left to wonder about the balance.  I also don't
want to sacrifice musing to these other activities, even if they might
improve the musings.

It appears that I must think at a larger scale.  I can probably
spare thirty minutes of mental energy beyond musing each day, at
least when I'm not doing homework.  Perhaps it's time to put together
a monthly "work on creativity" schedule.  That seems like a good
task for spring break [5].  At worst, I could set up a jar of things
to do (read, study art, write programs, edit, etc.) and pull out 
one thing each day.

Or maybe I'll just stick to my current habits and accept that I'll never
be a great writer, or sculptor, or scholar, or educator, or programmer.
In the end, it may not matter.  I do pretty well at all that I do, I
enjoy doing it, and, whether or not my work is great, it seems to impact
people positively.

Nonetheless, change is good.  I'll report back in a month or so on
whether I was able to set aside "creativity time" each day and, if
so, how I used it.

**_Postscript_**: I wonder whether this is one of those pieces that I
should have set aside for editing time.  I realize that it's
impossible to perfect any piece of writing, but there's always room
for improvement.  I'm relatively confident that this piece has a
convention center's worth of room.

---

**_Postscript_**: I'm also reminded that I need to revisit the basic
rules of English grammar.  Conveniently, Amazon had Bryan A. Garner's
_The Chicago Guide to Grammar, Usage, and Punctuation_ on sale.  I'll
add that to my list of things to explore during "creativity time".

[1] Given how much I consume, that feels a bit ironic.

[2] I'm still waiting for the release of [the
monograph](https://prestelpublishing.randomhouse.de/book/Elias-Sime/Tracy-Adler/Prestel-com/e557428.rhd).

[3] I'd swear I wrote something about that visit, but I can't find it
anywhere.  I wonder where my notes are.  They're not in my pocket
notebook.  They're not in my iPhone notebook.  I'll need to look harder.

[4] I do spend a few hours on that for Ralph's class.

[5] Along with a not-yet-canceled external review, some meetings, preparation
for my talk on the open curriculum, gathering resources for my advisee essays,
cleaning the house, revising and writing essays for _The Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_, and a bunch more.

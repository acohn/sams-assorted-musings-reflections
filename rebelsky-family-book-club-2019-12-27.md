Choosing a book for the Rebelsky Family Book Club
=================================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-biographical), short*

About a year and a half ago, I challenged all of the members of my
family to read Carol Dweck's [Mindset](family-book-club-mindset).
Our discussion of that book became the start of the Rebelsky Family
Book Club.  We rotate who chooses the book, find a date to discuss,
order pizza [1], and sit down and talk through the book.  Over the
past eighteen-or-so months, we've read ten books or other things.
Our most recent reading was Franz Kafka's _The Metamorphosis_, [the
Bernovksy
translation](https://smile.amazon.com/Metamorphosis-New-Translation-Susan-Bernofsky/dp/B00MW6AUUA/)
[2].  It's fun to sit down as a family and see how each of us reacts
to a work.  We don't always run the group as I'd like, but we manage
to elicit some useful conversation and delightful digressions.

Our discussions about choosing a book are also enlightening, if not
necessarily delightful.  For example, Youngest wanted to choose
_Infinite Jest_.  Someone else claimed that no one has ever read
that book all the way through.  In the end, we decided that it was
best not to try to read and discuss a dense, 1000-plus page book
[3].  I expect that he chose Kafka in response.

Now it's my turn to choose.  I chose nonfiction the last two times,
first _Mindset_ and then [_Designing Your
Life_](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful/dp/1101875321/),
which a Grinnell College Trustee recommended to me.  It feels like it's
time to choose fiction.  I suggested _One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest_,
which I recall appreciating.  However, one son suggested that it's
too much of a "traditional book-club book; you know, the ones that
you get assigned as summer reading" and another recalled reading it
and not appreciating it [4].

So now I'm debating what to choose next.  There's always a tension
between choosing something I've read already, like _Cuckoo's Nest, and
choosing something that is on my "to read" list, like _Designing Your
Life_.

A friend had suggested that I read Emily St. John Mandel's _Station
Eleven_ during my sabbatical.  I'm not sure it would be the best
book for our reading group, but it's worth considering.  I'd like
to share my enjoyment of Howard Frank Mosher with my family; there's
just a question of which book to read.  I may have to revisit a few
to choose.  I just started R. F. Kuang's _The Poppy War_.  Most of my
family enjoys some kind of epic fantasy, and this seems to come from
a very different cultural context.  My children debate language enough
that they might enjoy Cathleen Schine's _The Grammarrians_; I've seen
some good reviews of it.

I could also take an easier way out.  Almost everyone in the family
has read William Goldman's _The Princess Bride_; Michelle and I
have enjoyed it since long before the movie came out.  Michelle and
I both like Charles de Lint's _Moonheart_.  That's a bit long, but
it's a nice bit of urban fantasy.

Or maybe I should just go in a completely different direction, and
select something like Maurice Sendak's _Higglety Pigglety Pop! or
There Must Be More to Life_.  It would certainly permit a different
kind of discussion and we might even be able to get it done before
the kids scatter to the edges of the country.

Decisions, decisions.

books.

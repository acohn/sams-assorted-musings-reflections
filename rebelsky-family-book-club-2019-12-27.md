Choosing a reading for the Rebelsky Family Book Club
====================================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-biographical), short*

About a year and a half ago, I asked all of the members of my
immediate family to read Carol Dweck's [Mindset](family-book-club-mindset).
Our discussion of that book became the start of what we now call
"The Rebelsky Family Book Club".  We rotate who chooses the book,
find a date to discuss [1], order pizza [2], and sit down and talk
through the book.  Over the past eighteen-or-so months, we've read
ten books or other things.  Our most recent reading was Franz Kafka's
_The Metamorphosis_, [the Bernovksy
translation](https://smile.amazon.com/Metamorphosis-New-Translation-Susan-Bernofsky/dp/B00MW6AUUA/)
[3].  It's fun to sit down as a family and see how each of us reacts
to a work.  We don't always run the group as I'd like, but we manage
to elicit some useful conversation and delightful digressions.

I wish I could report the details of our discussion about _The
Metamorphosis_.  However, I'm pretty sure that what is said in the
book club stays in the book club.  I will note that we touched on
Kafka's sense of humor but did not delve as deeply into the meaning
of the three bearded gentlemen as I would have liked.

We rotate who chooses the book, from oldest (me) to youngest (Youngest
Son).  Our discussions about choosing a book are also enlightening,
if not necessarily delightful.  For example, Youngest wanted to
choose _Infinite Jest_.  Someone else claimed that no one has ever
read that book all the way through.  In the end, we decided that
it was best not to try to read and discuss a dense, 1000-plus page
book [4].  I expect that he chose Kafka in response.  "If you won't
let me read something long, I'll choose something short."  I'm surprised
that he didn't choose _Consider the Lobster_.

Now it's my turn to choose.  I chose nonfiction the last two times,
first _Mindset_ and then [_Designing Your
Life_](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful/dp/1101875321/),
which a Grinnell College Trustee recommended to me.  It feels like it's
time to choose fiction.  I suggested _One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest_,
which I recall appreciating when I read it in college.  However,
one son suggested that it's too much of a "traditional book-club
book; you know, the ones that you get assigned as summer reading"
and another recalled reading it and not appreciating it [5].

So now I'm debating what else I might choose.  There's always a tension
between choosing something I've read already, like _Cuckoo's Nest, and
choosing something that is on my "to read" list, like _Designing Your
Life_.

A friend suggested that I read Emily St. John Mandel's _Station
Eleven_ during my sabbatical.  I'm not sure it would be the best
book for our reading group, since it may be even more depressing
than _The Metamorphosis_, but it's worth considering.  Alternately, I'd like
to share my enjoyment of Howard Frank Mosher with my family; there's
just a question of which book to read; I may have to revisit a few
to choose.  There are certainly other choices.  I just started R.
F. Kuang's _The Poppy War_.  Most of my family enjoys some kind of
epic fantasy, and this seems to come from a very different cultural
context.  My children debate language enough that they might enjoy
Cathleen Schine's _The Grammarians_; I've seen some good reviews
of it.

I could also take an easier way out.  Almost everyone in the family
has read William Goldman's _The Princess Bride_; Michelle and I
have enjoyed it since long before the movie came out.  Michelle and
I both like Charles de Lint's _Moonheart_.  That's a bit long, but
it's a nice bit of urban fantasy.

Or maybe I should just go in a completely different direction, and
select something like Maurice Sendak's _Higglety Pigglety Pop! or
There Must Be More to Life_.  It would certainly permit a different
kind of discussion and we might even be able to get it done before
the kids scatter to the edges of the country.

Decisions, decisions.

Postscript: Arguably, my prior two choices are self-help books of
some sort.  So I could pick another kind of nonfiction.  But I'll
leave that for the next round of readings.

[1] That's getting harder and harder as they move away.

[2] Or, on occasion, something else.

[3] Nope, I still don't have an Amazon affiliate account.

[4] Sorry Tim!

[5] I love my children, even if we don't always share a taste in
books.

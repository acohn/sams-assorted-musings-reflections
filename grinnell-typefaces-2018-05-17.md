Grinnell's new typeface choices
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), typography, open source, rambly*

Grinnell recently announced the new font families [1] that we will
be using throughout the College.  What are the font families?  The
primary families are [Futura](https://typekit.com/fonts/futura-pt)
[2], which serves as our sans-serif font family, and [Freight Text
Pro](https://typekit.com/fonts/freight-text) [3], which serves as our
serif font family.  At first glance, they seem like reasonable choices;
Futura is a classic that still has a bit of edge [4]; Freight Text Pro is
a relatively modern typeface that seems to have a few
nice flourishes to set it apart from the myriad of
other serif faces.  And, as [a blurb about Freight Text
Pro](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/garagefonts/freight-text-pro/)
suggests,

> From technical manuals to university catalogues ... Freight Text
Pro is designed to excel anywhere style and sturdiness are required.

It appears that the College's designers are particularly enamored of Futura.
Not only does it serve as our primary display text in an ALL-CAPS form,
typically with a lot of spacing between the letters [6], but it also
seems to get used for body text in print publications.  I don't see us
using Freight Text Pro as much in printed documents, but we do seem to be
using it on [the new Admissions site](our-grinnellian-story-2018-05-15).

Both Futura and Freight Text Pro are commercial typefaces that are not
readily available on most computers.  Hence, to make things easier [7],
there are two alternative choices available.  Communications tells us that
we can use Arial as the sans-serif face and Georgia as the serif face.
In particular

> In scenarios where Futura and Freight may not be available, Arial and Georgia are suitable replacements. [8]

These strike me as strange alternatives.

Other than sharing a lack of serifs, Arial looks a lot different than
Futura.  You'd never mistake one for the other [9].  In addition to the
general "feel" of the face (I notice, for example, much higher ascenders
in Futura than in Arial [10] and that Futura is much less consistent in
the height of ascenders [11]), there are many clear differences in individual
letters.  Futura's "a"s don't have the little doohickey on top; Arial's
do.  Futura's "t"s are perfectly straight.  Arial's "t"s have a curve at
the bottom.  You get a very different sense from the two.  Plus, Arial is,
well, Arial.  As far as I can tell, it's the default sans-serif font on
every Microsoft product.  While Futura is edgy, Arial is staid.

I don't have great access to Freight Text Pro, so it's harder
to compare it to Georgia.  It looks like Freight Text Pro has
thicker serifs, or at least thicker horizontal serifs, such
as at the bottom of "n" and "q).  Does that make it a "[slab
serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_serif)" font?  I think so.
I see that Freight Text Pro has relatively short ascenders [12]; that
makes it a bit of a strange pairing with Arial.  Georgia's ascenders
seem slightly taller.  Both are fairly consistent in stroke width, at
least from my quick exploration.  But Georgia was designed for the Web,
not for print.  What if one wants to do printed documents?  Should one
really use a Web typeface for those purposes?

When Communications first announced the new typefaces, I did the only
logical thing: I asked for copies to use in my own work.  ITS wasn't
prepared for the question, so I asked Communications.  I was told,
"You can use the alternative fonts."  But why choose typefaces to identify
ourselves if we're not going to use them consistently?  My guess is that
we're too cheap to purchase a site license.  Alternately, they don't
want to support the difficulty of people adding new faces.

But you know what?  I can't use Arial or Georgia in my everyday work,
even if I wanted to.  I do most of my writing on a Linux Workstation
using either LaTeX or `html2ps` [14].  Microsoft does not seem inclined
to provide free versions of either Arial or Georgia.  I would rather (a)
have the College buy the typefaces so that the designers of Futura and
Freight Text Pro are appropriately compensated or (b) use open faces.
Communications has not responded to my revised request for either the
typefaces or a recommended open alternative, so I'm left to search on
my own.

There are [a variety of free (like beer) and open-source font families
available](https://opensource.com/life/16/2/top-sources-open-source-fonts).
[Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com) seems to have a particularly
large range of choices.  But which ones to pick?

The problem is that not all advice is helpful when
I'm trying to match the look and feel of these faces.
For example, when I look at [a list of alternatives to
Futura](https://freebies.fluxes.com/blog/8-free-futura-font-alternatives/)
only one of them comes close to achieving the effect of the high
ascenders in Futura.  The rest, well, seem to just be interesting
sans-serif font families.

One fun stop was [the league of moveable
type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/), which
has some nice types and some nice accompanying verbiage.
My initial inclination was to consider using [League
Spartan](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-spartan)
for sans serif and [Goudy Bookletter
1911](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/goudy-bookletter-1911)
for serif.  (The serifs seemed relatively consistent with Freight Text
Pro).  But each is only available as a single font.  I generally need
three faces: plain [15], bold and italic.

After way too much time on Font Squirrel and elsewhere, I ended up 
settling on [Renner*](http://indestructibletype.com/Renner.html) as
my Futura alternative.  It looks the most like Futura, except for the
inclusion of that curvy top piece on lowercase "a".  And it comes in
multiple faces.  It's not only a much better family than Arial, it's
much closer to Futura.  Plus, it has a reasonable open-source license [16].

I've had less luck finding an alternative to Freight Text Pro.  I've found
I really like many parts of it, from the stem on the "b" to the overall
structure of the lowercase "e".  I'm still not certain, but I may end
up trying [Besley*](http://indestructibletype.com/Besley.html), which
has a similar heaviness to Freight Text Pro and similar slab serifs.
It doesn't have quite all the characteristics I like of Freight Text Pro
[17], but I think it's worth trying.

I'm not sure how Communications will feel about these choices.  But you
know what?  They haven't offered me any alternatives to try.  And anyone
who says you can substitute Arial for Futura doesn't really care that much
about typography.

Now I just have to figure out how to incorporate these typefaces in
the programs I use most regularly [18].  That's a task (and a musing)
for another day.

Postscript: Since we have a license for Web usage of Futura PT and Freight
Text Pro, I also asked to use those fonts on my Web site.  I was told
that we don't yet have a policy on using those fonts on sites other than
the central site.  So I'm waiting.  Given other experiences I've had with
waiting for Communications on Web stuff [19], I have a long time to wait.

Postscript: If you're interested in reading some things
that make Futura an interesting font family, such as
the overshoots on some of the letters, [this article on
alternatives](https://designmodo.com/futura-font-alternatives/) provides
a good starting point.

Postscript: Wouldn't it be cool if Grinnell chose to license Renner* and
Besley* rather than Futura and Freight Text Pro?  Then we could make a
bold statement about how even our font choice supports our promotion
of open dialogue, or something like that.

[1] When I'm trying to be serious in talking about these kinds of issues
I do my best to distinguish the term "font" from the term "typeface".
The former is a particular weight and shape (italic, roman); the latter
is a collection of related fonts.  That is, a typeface is a "font family".
Casual usage, including my own casual usage, conflates the two.

[2] Or perhaps Futura PT.

[3] We seem to refer to it only as "Freight" in some documentation.

[4] One of my colleagues notes that Futura is used by "luxury designers
such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Dolce and Gabbana".  Are we going
for a luxury look?  I'm not sure.  I see that [the Barbican also uses
Futura](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/3250/barbican-arts-centre-identity),
although I think they use Futura SH
[5].  You may want to compare their [visual identity
guidelines](https://www.barbican.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2017-08/Barbican_Guidelines.pdf)
to ours.

[5] Did you know that there are multiple versions of Futura?  I didn't.
But now I see that different type manufacturers make different versions
of Futura.  [Futura SB](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sb/)
is from the Scangraphic digital type collection and is designed for
body text.  [Futura SH](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sh/) is also from the Scangraphic digital type collection and is intended for
headlines.  [Futura PT](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/futura-book/), which is what we seem to be using, was created by ParaType.
[Linotype has a Futura, too](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/futura/).
Can I tell the differences?  Not really.

[6] I don't like all-caps Futura.  I particularly dislike all-caps
Futura with the excess spacing that they've decided to use for display
text.  The letter widths vary so much (e.g., L is particularly narrow
and N is wide) that the combination seems disconcerting at best.

[7] More on that issue later.

[8] <https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/communications/brand/visual-identity>

[9] Perhaps I'm wrong.  I've seen students who don't realize that they've
switched from a serif font to a sans-serif font on their résumés.  But
most of the people I know, including, I assume, most of my readers, pay
a bit of attention to fonts.

[10] Or is that a smaller x-height?  I never know how to assess such issues.
In any case, the ratio of ascender height to x-height in Futura is large.

[11] Compare, for example, "t" and "h".  "t" has a short ascender.
"h" has a tall one.

[12] Perhaps a relatively high x-height.  As I said, I haven't been thinking
enough about type design recently.

[14] I use `html2ps` more frequently than LaTeX.

[15] Or "Roman" or "book" or whatever you want to call it.

[16] If I find myself using it regularly, I'll certainly pay the designer.

[17] As I said, I'm really finding myself becoming fond of the lowercase
"b".  It's both the way the designer handles the upper serif (an
approach that gets replicated on other letters with vertical ascenders)
and the lower-left corner, which seems atypical.

[18] Setting up for programs on the Mac was easy.  I just used Font book.
Preparing to use LaTeX and `html2ps` looks to be harder.

[19] E.g., I think we're over four years on "we threw everything and
everyone off the main Web server without having planned a place for it
and them to go; we'll come up with something soon".

Yesterday, I started a series of notes of appreciation for different
groups on campus.  You can read [that first
musing](thankful-registrar-2020-07-20) for some background [1].

Today I want to express my thanks to the staff of ITS.

You may find that strange, particularly given my incredible and
vocal frustration with the byzantine [2] and restrictive policies
that have been flowing from ITS recently.  But the majority of the
ITS staff are not responsible for making those policies and they
affect them as much as they affect us, particularly in that they
have to deal with the workload consequences of those policies.  The
policies may spring from the leadership of ITS or they may come
from elsewhere (e.g., our Board, our President, our Risk Management
Team); the vast majority of ITS are not to blame.

Like everyone, I get frustrated when technology doesn't work.  I get
frustrated when it takes longer than I would like to get something fixed.

But you know what?  In almost every encounter I've had with the ITS
staff, they've been gracious, helpful, and concerned about supporting
the work I do.  They deal with my odd and sometimes aggressive
personality.  They deal with my weird computer configurations.  They
deal with my really strange questions and complaints [3].  In most
cases, they respond promptly [4].

And their jobs are hard.  ITS is understaffed.  I understand that
it is particularly understaffed right now, even for normal times.
But these are not normal times.  technology needs are ramping up
on campus: We have a whole new building, we have faculty and students
moving online, we have new policies that create work for everyone
[5].  Would you want to help a few hundred people learn how to
connect to a VPN to access a variety of resources when the software
does not reliably install and some percentage don't have hardware
that they cannot use? [6] I know I would not.

If I were in their place, I'd be grumpy and frustrated [7].  But,
as I said, I've found staff friendly and helpful [8].  I appreciate
that.

I know that people get upset with ITS.  It's horrible when the
computer you rely on doesn't work.  It's worse when it's brand new
and it doesn't work.  But if there's one things I've learned [9]
in over thirty-five years as a computer scientist [10], it's that
when things go wrong with computers, it's either trivial or impossible.
As I tell my students, computers are sentient and malicious.  The
ITS staff I've talked to would love to fix things [11], but tracking
down bugs can take more time than they have, and I'm pretty sure
that the College won't let them rely on the easy solution of "Just
replace it with another one."

So, I say **Thank you** to the staff of ITS.  I can't imagine having
to do all that you are doing right now.  I can't imagine having to
face the frustrations the people are having with technology and how
that affects their interactions.  I appreciate that you are working
hard to support the employees and students of Grinnell College.  I
appreciate all the positive interactions I've had with you.  I
apologize if I have been short or unreasonable with you.

For those who are not ITS staff: I ask then when you feel frustrated,
you remember that the ITS staff have always been overworked and that
they are feeling even more so right now.  Please be patient.

For those of you who are writing the technology policies that are
making our lives more difficult: Please consider the impacts your
policies are having on everyone's wellness and workload.  We are
an educational institution, not a Fortune 500 company.  Our policies
should be more suited to our educational mission.  

Thank you.

**_Postscript_**: I almost made it through a whole musing on technology
without a significant rant.  I'll treat that as a net positive.

[1] You'll need to skip over the TL;DR.

[2] Or is it Byzantine?

[3] Have I mentioned that I complained that Webex does not allow you
to enter 12:00 noon as a time and instead forces you to enter the
ambiguous and unacceptable 12:00 p.m. or 12:00 a.m.?  That's just
the tip of the iceberg.

[4] Nope, I'm not listing exceptions.

[5] The new VPN policy and the relatively new software policy are two
examples.

[6] The latter means getting them the hardware promptly.  More work!

[7] Okay, I'm usually grumpy and frustrated.

[8] Or at least as helpful as they can be, given current policies.

[9] It wasn't to avoid trite phrases.

[10] Ouch!  I'm old.

[11] Or, better yet, to have things work perfectly.

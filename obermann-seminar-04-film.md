Discussing film and music at my fourth Obermann seminar
=======================================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), academia*

About a week ago, I attended my fourth bi-weekly seminar at the Obermann
Center.  The seminars provide an opportunity to share and receive feedback
on our work in progress.  While it's useful to get feedback on my work,
especially from people in other disciplines, I particularly appreciate
the opportunity to spend time reading and reflecting on different
scholarly areas.

Although this most recent seminar provided my second opportunity for
[1], I was especially excited to participate in the other
discussion.  One of the other fellows does work at the intersection of
film and music, exploring the interplay between soundtrack and content.
Since some of my favorite experiences with close reading, as it were,
came from my film classes with Gerald Mast [2], it was nice to be able
to return to those experiences.  And, while we were not asked to view
whole films for our Obermann seminar, the clips we did view [3] brought
me back to the times when I would watch and rewatch films to explore
themes and approaches.

Of course, I was also reminded of how different the film study experience
is these days than when I was in college.  Videotapes were new in the
early 1980's, and few films were available.  I remember how privileged
I felt to have access to the University of Chicago's film collection
and the private screening room [4].  There's something very different
about handling celluloid [5].  On the other hand, it's also nice
to be able to easily find and explore connections on the Interweb.
One of the films we discussed was readily available on YouTube, and
it's much easier to skim through a YouTube video than a reel of film.

For this particular project, the Interweb afforded more natural
opportunities to look beyond the film.  We could, for example, explore the
soundtracks for the films, including both the music and the cover art.
Since each movie had multiple soundtrack albums, including both a more
traditional soundtrack and an "inspired by" soundtrack, I found it useful
to compare the differences more directly, rather than just reading about
them in the draft paper [6].  I also found it useful to identify other
related materials, such as the trailers for the films.  In at least one
case, they used different footage and different background music in a
critical scene in the trailer, and I appreciated the chance to compare
the two.

Of course, my forays onto the Interweb included both inaccurate
information, such as a false claim about the instrumentation that appeared
on a page on Wikipedia, and surprising discoveries, such as a reissue
of one of the soundtracks under a separate name in which it is not
immediately identified as a soundtrack.  I shared the latter with my
colleague, and they had not known of it.

I do my best to attend talks by Grinnell colleagues when they present
their scholarship.  But there's something very different about having the
time to read through a draft paper and to explore related issues before
discussing the paper.  The experience feels more intellectually luxurious.
Or at least it feels luxurious to have the time to spend time on something
for just the intellectual pleasure.  Knowing that I can, on occasion,
contribute to a colleague's scholarship, has also been a source of joy.

While I'm particularly enthusiastic about this week's topic, it's not
just the opportunity to discuss film that feels special.  When we were
reading a more sociological paper in a previous seminar, I sought out
the data in the paper [7].  The few digital humanities papers we've read
have given me a few hours of pleasure exploring related archives.

At times, the musings provide a similar luxury.  That is, I allow
myself a few hours to explore a topic that I might not otherwise have
considered.  For example, I had a pleasant afternoon during late summer
in which I drafted some notes on the works of by Tery Fugate-Wilcox
[8]. More recently, I've been looking forward to responding to an old
piece on education by Grinnell's own Glenn Leggett.  But these kinds
of experiences provide less fulfillment than preparing for participating in
a real scholarly conversation.

There are probably ways to replicate the experience of discussing a work
in progress with people from a variety of disciplines.  Maybe it already
happens at Grinnell, and I don't hear about it because I'm too busy, too
old, too curmudgeonly, or too much of an outsider [9].  Maybe I do hear,
and I don't pay close enough attention.  I'm not sure.

In any case, for the time being, I will continue to luxuriate in the
opportunity the bi-weekly seminars provide.

[1] More on that in [a separate musing](obermann-seminar-04-project).

[2] I like to name drop once in a while.

[3] And the additional clips I sought out.

[4] Being involved in DOC films helped a lot.

[5] Or whatever physical medium is used for film.

[6] I am doing my best not to provide too many details about the films
because I do not want to tread on my colleague's work.

[7] I didn't find anything in the data that my colleague had not
identified.  Still, I enjoyed the opportunity.

[8] That musing still requires significantly more work, so it will
likely not appear for some time.

[9] If I were doing work on film and music, I would not consider inviting
one of the CS faculty to participate in discussions of my work.

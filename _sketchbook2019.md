Musing sketchbook (2019)
========================

_This document serves as my "sketchbook" for 2019; the location in which
I put my planned musings.  Since it's an electronic document, it will
change regularly.  When I finish a musing, it tends to disappear from
the sketchbook._

End of month
------------

* Originally thought I'd post a bunch of "illustrated" musings.  Failed
  to do so.
* Much calmer about missing days.  I'm not sure whether that's a good
  thing or a bad thing.
* Have already accumulated way too many topics for musings.
* Michelle says fewer readers.  Do I care?  A bit; it's nice to have readers.
  However, as I've said in the past, I write primarily for myself and my
  family.

1. "Pleaded" or "Pled".  Why are people using the former?

1. Tchotchkies (mostly about the ones in the new office).

1. A new laptop cover.

1. Daily reading?

1. Number of advisees. Lot recently.  How many total?  It came to mind
when someone asked about one of my most famous advisees and I went to
look things up.  At last count, 287. That's only about 12 per eyar.

1. The InterWeb ruins things.  (Underwater basket weaving.)  Facebook
memory from July 3, 2013. "Last night at summer camp, I got to do
underwater basket weaving. Amazingly, soaking in water that long isn't
all that good for the reeds. (And they tend to float apart.)

1. Identifying as ...?  
Am I white?  Race is a social construct.  Nonetheless, we are expected to
choose a race when we fill out demographic information.  I certainly have
a pale skintone.  And that can give me a lot of advantages over those with
darker skintones.  For example, I'm unlikely to be pulled over because
I look "suspicious".  However, as a Jew [1] I'm not identified as white
by white supremacists or by many folks in power; there was certainly a
time that Jews were not allowed in places that were supposed to be for
"whites", such as country clubs.  I've certainly been stopped on the
street by people who say "You're Jewish, right?" [2]  With the rize
of white supremacy and of anti-semitism, I'm finding that I have 
increasing difficulty calling myself "white".

[1] Another complex issue.
[2] In the case I remember most clearly, it was intended as a positive.

1. Abstract and Cubist Art.  https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/2748
Intriguing to have a marked up manuscript, or what seems to be a marked
up manuscript.  Corrections for a second edition?

This afternoon, I'm trying to hunt down my latest heisenbug. This is a fun one. It's in a GIMP plugin I'm writing. It crashes when run normally. It crashes at the same point with a malloc error when run through gdb. It runs fine through valgrind. At least I've learned how to use gdb and valgrind on GIMP plugins.

"He said that from these students' perspective, 'here I am and I don't have political and economic power..."
This line made me go "What, now?" in relation to the Hampshire case. While I do understand that, regardless of income, education, etc., white people do have some advantages over non-whites simply because of race, we also have to acknowledge the likelihood that the person who graduates from a selective, expensive private liberal arts college in Massachusetts will likely have more political and economic power than a Maine Community College graduate, regardless of race.

I think it would be helpful for students-and we are talking about students, college students, who, regardless of where they came from, will enter into adulthood with an advantage over their non-college graduate friends and family members-to understand the relative power and advantage that their education will bestow upon them. A college degree doesn't erase racism, it doesn't equalize privilege, but is simply inaccurate to assume that a college student doesn't "have political and economic power."

When I was in college, a wonderful, expensive (I'm white, but was on scholarship) liberal arts college set in a beautiful but economically depressed area, there was an incident in which a Latina student overheard a custodial staff member (back in the days before contract hiring...) make a unambiguously racist comment in a private conversation with a co-worker. The student complained, and the staff member was fired. A professor pointed out, a few years later, that the student, now an alum, had an excellent job in finance in lower Manhattan, and the former custodial staff member remained unemployed, his family uninsured, and asked us to ponder who really had power there. It was perhaps the most valuable thing I learned in college-not understanding how much power you really have can lead to unintended damage.

I am not excusing what the guy said. While it was not threatening, and it was not directed toward an individual, it was demeaning, ignorant, and indeed very racists. Still, though, I get really sad when I think of the guy losing his job. I lost a job once. It was not fun. And I got another job very quickly. Because I am a college educated person.

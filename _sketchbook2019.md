Musing sketchbook (2019)
========================

_This document serves as my "sketchbook" for 2019; the location in which
I put my planned musings.  Since it's an electronic document, it will
change regularly.  When I finish a musing, it tends to disappear from
the sketchbook._

Tentative upcoming week
-----------------------

* Thursday: Workload
* Friday: Post-prereg?
* Saturday: Visiting UofC + Working at UofC
* Sunday: Pioneer Classic
* Monday: Memo about tutorial/open curriculum.
* Tuesday: How do you teach CS?


End of month
------------

* Had hoped to be more on top of things, but missed the first three days
  of the month.
* Once I started posting, often found that I wanted to post multiple 
  things each day.  That includes one day when I posted three short
  musings.  Maybe I should learn to pace myself.  Also issue that
  readers had trouble keeping up when I posted multiple musings on the
  same day.
* Unexpected that misnaming got so much comment.

Written, need minor revisions

Short
-----

1. Memories of holidays past or holidays passed?  Does it matter?

1. "mischievous".  I've always pronounced it "miss chiv us", which is
pretty close to the "mischief" at the root of the word.  But I have a
close friends who adds an extra syllable, "miss cheeve ee us".  I
thought it was only them.  But the other day, I was listening to a
live recording of Michael Nesmith, and I'll be damned if he pronounces
it with four syllables, too.

1. Visiting UofC.  See notes on iPhone.

1. When Sam worked too much at UofC.

1. All Things Grinnell T-Shirt.  See deskop.

1. Gordo.

1. Fun with Grinnell email addresses.  traciand.  galangry.  perlmutt.
I need to keep track of others.

1. Trust.  At a recent faculty meeting, Dean Harris talked about how things
work at Grinnell, and noted that a lot of what makes Grinnell work comes
down to trust.  I agree [If I recall correctly, she even noted that
I nodded in response.]  I'd had a musing about trust in my long-term
mental queue of things to write about [not everything makes it into my
sketchbook].  If I recall correctly, I had it phrased as "good will",
rather than "trust", but it's a similar enough concept.

1. Office Hour Signups.  Recently, as I was reading the excerpts from
Grinnell's Executive Council, I learned that some consider it a FERPA
violation to post sign-up sheets for office hours outside of our offices.
IANAL/IANAFO [I am not a lawyer and I am not a FERPA officer ], so you
should take everything I say [write] with a grain [or granary] of salt.

1. Volunteering for NESFA.  Im not sure why my muse had me write
this. Probably only of interest to me. But maybe the kids would
want to know. Reminded by car parked in front of historical museum
driveway.  My brain said “remember when you accidentally parked in
front of a driveway and your car was towed?”  And I remembered. It
was one of those months when I was volunteering to help with the
NESFA (new england science fiction association) ‘zine [or whatever
they called it].  What does that mean?  Well, back in the misty
depths of time (that is, late 1970's/early 1980's), SF (never SciFi)
fans kept in touch with each other, in part, by writing regular
newletters.  Each newsletter might have reviews of books and other
media, short stories, or whatever the author thought was of interest.
If you mimeographed a bunch of your newsletter and sent the stack
to NESFA, a group of people, myself included, would collate all the
individual newsletters into a larger stack and then send them out.
Or at least that's what I remember.  Helping out with the newsletter
was fun; I met interesting people and built community.  It meant that
I knew people when I attended Boskone (whatever happend to my lifetime
membership).  And the informal friendships continued.  I still
recall spending a train ride from Boston to Chicago for the 1982
WorldCon in which we spent the whole ride talking and playing games.
(I stayed after WorldCon to attend college.)  I'm pretty sure that
I kept all of those old newsletters until mom moved out of her
house.  I wish I had moved them to Grinnell, if only to give them to
the UIowa archive of SF memorabilia.  Oh well.

1. Honors in CS.  I'm not sure why, but I've recently been thinking
about the requirements for honors in CS.  In order to be awarded honors
in a department at Grinnell, you need at least a 3.4 overall gpa, at
least a 3.5 gpa in the major [I don't know whether they count required
courses from outside the department in that computation], and to meet
the individual department's requirements.  Early in my career at Grinnell,
we had a fairly clear set of requirements: You had to take both 211 and
213, you had to take an extra upper-level CS or math class, you had to
do extra-curricular work on campus judged as excellent by the members of
the department, and you had to do external work judged as excellent, such
as high performance on the GREs or publishing a paper.  We often 
awarded honors to students who had met only three of the four requirements,
provided they had done particularly well at one of the last two requirements.
A few years ago, we changed the requirements to be more like those of other
departments.  They now read [fill in details].  I was originally in favor
of the change, but I must admit that it's getting harder and harder to
decide whether or not students deserve honors, particularly as we deal
with larger and larger numbers of students in the department and, therefore,
larger numbers of candidates for honors.  In any case, as I think about our
core requirements ("significant engagement in the department and excellence in computing-related work"), I begin to wonder why a high gpa is required
for honors.  Isn't it honorable if you do excel in those two things, even 
if your gpa is lower?  And don't students sometimes achieve higher gpas
by taking fewer risks?  I recall one peer in high school who refused to take
AP Calculus because they knew they'd get an A in the non-AP math course
and worried they might get a B in the other course.  I'd rather a student
who takes courses that they might get lower grades in because they want
to challenge themselves.  Why do we focus so much on gpa?

1. "My dad is the third-largest major at Grinnell" / majoring in a
faculty member, but that's a whole separate issue.  (Now John
Garrison is probably the third-largest major at Grinnell.)

1. Persnickety.  List of new faculty.  Minutes of the last faculty
meeting.  (Perhaps this one does not need to exist any more, but it
could also be a quick release.)

1. Eggnog and other holiday memories.  See file.

1. Changing names.  (ACM Policies.)  Proud of my communities.

1. Lost opportunities.  See file.

1. Strange jokes.  Watching _Superstore_ (well, having it on in the
background while musing).  One of the episodes has the following
sign: "Let Cloud 9 design your chuppah.  It's L'Cheavenly."  Season 1,
Episode 8, 8:57.  Who thinks to put something like that in a tv show?

1. Quiche.  When I was a teenager and a young adult, I made quiche
regularly.  The other day, I ordered quiche for lunch and Eldest
Son said, "What's quiche?"  What have I done wrong?

1. The Functional Art.  <https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization-ebook/dp/B0091SXDOM/>  When I saw the title, I was
very excited.  After all, functional art is what I do.  (Functional, as
in functional programming.)  I also appreciate craft.

1. Qualtrics surveys and usability.  You never can tell whether the
right arrow brings you to another page or finishes the survey.  Why
do they design it like that?

1. Comments on my musings.  I include [whatever the annotation software
is] on every page.  But the only way I know that someone has commented
is that they send me a note.  I wonder if there's a way to do that
automagically.

1. Rethinking my approach.  Often, when I talk to close colleagues
who work in one of the areas of campus I tend to criticize, I tell
them that they should let me know if I've stepped over the line.
Their normal response is something like "It doesn't bother me, but
I know it bothers some people I work with.  And you don't always
get things right.  Even when you do, there are a lot of factors you
don't know about."  I expect that's true.  And I've increasingly
been trying to moderate my approach.  But I don't think I'm going to
stop doing what I do.  Most of the things I muse about are things that
other folks are saying.  Isn't it better to have things out in public,
rather than discussed behind peoples' backs?

1. I hate Lincare.  I have sleep apnea.  I've been using a CPAP for
about eighteen years.  I'm a compliant patient; I'm not sure I've
missed a night in those eighteen years except when something went
wrong (e.g., I lost the mask while on a trip).  I just switched to
my third CPAP.  I used Lincare, the same company I've used for all eighteen
years.  But Lincare no longer has a Grinnell office, and dealing with
the remote offices has not been a good experience, to say the least.

1. Common courtesty.  (Already written.)

1. Syllabi.  At the start of the semeter, I heard a lot of complaints
that students don't seem to be reading the syllabus.  "Why didn't
they get the reading done?"  "Why do they think the homework I gave
out is due on this Monday and not next Monday?" But syllabi (or at
least our forms of syllabi) may be strange to first-year students.
It's one of the reasons that when I'm a Tutorial prof, I devote
time in the third-or-so Tutorial meeting for students the record
all of their assignments from their calendars.

1. Nonsequiters anonymous?

1. Changes at Chicago.  Who the hell is Phil the Phoenix?  What year
were we founded?

1. LibraryThing and CueCat.

1. Stranded by Greil Marcus.  https://greilmarcus.net/2014/10/10/it-was-totally-irresponsible-gm-re-the-stranded-discography-051112/

1. Lamejun.  One of my fond memories of my time in Newton, or returning
to Newton, is eating lamejun, most frequently purchased from Massis
bakery in Watertown.  For those not in the know, lamejun is an Armenian
dish; a thin flatbread spread with a spiced meat.  The Rebelsky family 
tended to eat it with yoghurt; I'm pretty sure that's not traditional.
Eating lamejun gives me memory of my mother, of our kitchen, and, well,
just being home. 

1. Amazon classifications.  The Fuzzy and the Techie: Why the Liberal Arts Will Rule the Digital World.

1. Amazon Pricing bots.  Two kinds: Ones that increase and ones that
decrease.  Here's [a nice article about the former](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=358).  Note that it's gone down.  <https://www.amazon.com/Making-Fly-Genetics-Animal-Design/dp/0632030488/>.
I like the latter approach.  See Noam Nisan as an example of them conflicting.

1. Rothkoscape.  Idea from p. 19 of _Slowpoke_ by Jen Soresen "Converts

1. "Pleaded" or "Pled".  Why are people using the former?

1. Tchotchkies (mostly about the ones in the new office).

1. A new laptop cover.

1. Daily reading?

1. Number of advisees. Lot recently.  How many total?  It came to mind
when someone asked about one of my most famous advisees and I went to
look things up.  At last count, 287. That's only about 12 per eyar.

1. The InterWeb ruins things.  (Underwater basket weaving.)  Facebook
memory from July 3, 2013. "Last night at summer camp, I got to do
underwater basket weaving. Amazingly, soaking in water that long isn't
all that good for the reeds. (And they tend to float apart.)

1. Identifying as ...?  
Am I white?  Race is a social construct.  Nonetheless, we are expected to
choose a race when we fill out demographic information.  I certainly have
a pale skintone.  And that can give me a lot of advantages over those with
darker skintones.  For example, I'm unlikely to be pulled over because
I look "suspicious".  However, as a Jew [1] I'm not identified as white
by white supremacists or by many folks in power; there was certainly a
time that Jews were not allowed in places that were supposed to be for
"whites", such as country clubs.  I've certainly been stopped on the
street by people who say "You're Jewish, right?" [2]  With the rize
of white supremacy and of anti-semitism, I'm finding that I have 
increasing difficulty calling myself "white".

[1] Another complex issue.
[2] In the case I remember most clearly, it was intended as a positive.

1. Abstract and Cubist Art.  https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/2748
Intriguing to have a marked up manuscript, or what seems to be a marked

1. Post-prereg.

1. The memo about Tutorial/Open Curriculum.

1. If I had six months to live.  I'm not sure why, but I was feeling
maudlin the other day, and asked myself what I'd do if I had six
months to live.  My first reaction was "I'd get rid of all the crap
I've accumulated so that my kids wouldn't have to."  But I realized
that I should probably check with them first in case they had some
strange reason to want to keep things.  And I also began to wonder
whether that's something I should do now, rather than later.  But
I find it hard to get rid of things.  (See, for example, my regret
at getting rid of my old NESFA newsletters.)  Of course, I would
also set aside and document things that I thought the kids might
want to keep because they have particular meaning to me or the
family, such as the shark's tooth that my father used to wear (Did
he wear it, or did he just have it set up so that he could wear
it?) or the autographed Phil Ochs albums.  I also have some things
that likely have value to others.  It would make sense to set those
aside for the kids to sell.  Maybe the first set of things could serve
as the topics of musings.

1. For Mike: Teaching CS.

1. Influential teachers.

1. Why do some courses over-enroll and others fail to enroll?  I wish
I knew.  There seem to be a host of factors involved.  Some are the
reputation of the instructor.  (Reputation does not always correlate
with quality.  And, as I've said, different students react differently
to the same faculty member.)  Sometimes it's time of day.

1. Joy of Code: Counting majors

1. Dealing with students with prior background in CS.

1. Personnel reviews and EOCEs.  Just let it fly.

1. Music practica.  I think I need to do some more background research
on this one.  But it is blocked off.

1. Stanford vs. Grinnell.
Location: Stanford wins (unless you like isolation and snow).  Music
lessons.  Grinnell wins, hand's down.  Cheaper (free vs. $750 for 
non-majors, free vs. $375 for majors).  Available to all vs. by
audition.  Class size: We win!  Diversity: Stanford wins!  Cost:
Similar.

1. Changing models of shared governance.  Here's what I had in the
musing on music practica.  "Over the past ten years at Grinnell,
and mostly over the past five years, we’ve seen a significant shift
in the meaning of shared governance. These days, shared governance
often feels more like representative governance, which isn’t quite
the same. When I was a young faculty member, representative groups
like Council suggested changes in policy, but allowed faculty to
provide input and vote on those changes. Now, both the Dean’s office
and a number of committees seem to consider it acceptable to change
policy without broader discussion. I’m hoping that things will get
better with our new Dean."  I'll probably also end up discussing
ways in which faculty authority is being undermined.

1. Section and compose.

1. Meaning in Life.  The other day, an alum wrote to me and asked
"How did you find purpose in work? I understand that’s a large question."
I gave them a short answer, but promised that I'd muse more about it.  Here's
my short answers.  That's a large question.  I'll give a brief answer for the time being and come back to it later (probably as a musing).  For my case, it's not that hard to find meaning in what I do: I help young adults learn and grow.  I believe that makes a positive impact.  At least every few years, I hear from a student or recent alum who tells me that they wouldn't have finished Grinnell without me.  That's enough for me.

    But that kind of meaning only applies to a few jobs.  So how do you find meaning or purpose in other kinds of work?  In some cases (perhaps in many cases) you can identify a part of what you or your company does that has a positive impact.  For example, you help people experience the joy of music.  I firmly believe that music is good for humans.  (We'll ignore the cognitive dissonance of the less good things that your company does.)  Some people find joy, rather than meaning, in what they do.  Joy is not as powerful as meaning, but it's still a reason to do things.  Still others look at their current work as a pathway to other things; a few years building skills and then you can go on to do something more meaningful/purposeful.  A few treat the purpose of work as providing resources for things they otherwise value, such as money/time to donate to causes of import.

"He said that from these students' perspective, 'here I am and I don't have political and economic power..."
This line made me go "What, now?" in relation to the Hampshire case. While I do understand that, regardless of income, education, etc., white people do have some advantages over non-whites simply because of race, we also have to acknowledge the likelihood that the person who graduates from a selective, expensive private liberal arts college in Massachusetts will likely have more political and economic power than a Maine Community College graduate, regardless of race.

    I think it would be helpful for students-and we are talking about students, college students, who, regardless of where they came from, will enter into adulthood with an advantage over their non-college graduate friends and family members-to understand the relative power and advantage that their education will bestow upon them. A college degree doesn't erase racism, it doesn't equalize privilege, but is simply inaccurate to assume that a college student doesn't "have political and economic power."

    When I was in college, a wonderful, expensive (I'm white, but was on scholarship) liberal arts college set in a beautiful but economically depressed area, there was an incident in which a Latina student overheard a custodial staff member (back in the days before contract hiring...) make a unambiguously racist comment in a private conversation with a co-worker. The student complained, and the staff member was fired. A professor pointed out, a few years later, that the student, now an alum, had an excellent job in finance in lower Manhattan, and the former custodial staff member remained unemployed, his family uninsured, and asked us to ponder who really had power there. It was perhaps the most valuable thing I learned in college-not understanding how much power you really have can lead to unintended damage.

    I am not excusing what the guy said. While it was not threatening, and it was not directed toward an individual, it was demeaning, ignorant, and indeed very racists. Still, though, I get really sad when I think of the guy losing his job. I lost a job once. It was not fun. And I got another job very quickly. Because I am a college educated person.

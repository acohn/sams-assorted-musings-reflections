Over the past month or so, I've been reflecting on two rather
complicated musings that I'm planning to write.  One is a followup
to Dean Harris' comment that much of what happens successfully at
Grinnell is grounded in trust.  The other is a response to a question
from some staff colleagues about how faculty might be undermined
by staff [1].  Neither is easy to write.  Certainly, for both, I'm
trying to understand the perspectives of both faculty and staff
[2].

As I prepare to write those musings, I've been thinking about some
experiences that led me to make the claim about undermining and
that sometimes make me feel like my trust has been broken at the
College.  I recall President Kington saying that "Anecdotes are not
data" at one of his first presentations at the College.  Nonetheless,
I do think we learn things from stories and, while stories may not
provide evidence for the scope of a problem, they can give us some
understanding that the problem exists.  Stories also help personalize
issues; I've long said that one way we get to understand the
perspectives of those different than us is to listen to their
stories.

So, let me tell you a story.  More precisely, let me tell you a few
stories, or perhaps one story from multiple perspectives.  I expect
to reflect back on it in subsequent musings.

*Some background*

Last year, my research students and I had two papers accepted to
the [2019 SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science
Education](https://sigcse2019.sigcse.org/), which was held February
27th to March 2nd in Minneapolis. [3]  The papers described the
students design of and experience running two code camps for
middle-school students, one on data science and one on digital
humanities [4].  Getting papers accepted to SIGCSE is an accomplishment;
the acceptance rate is about 30% and it may be even lower for the
category in which they submitted their papers.  Submissions are
also non-trivial works; six two-column pages of single-spaced 10pt
text ends up being about 5,000 words.  Now, I'll admit that I was
responsible for the final writing but the paper built on the students'
drafts and it reflected their work.  Sarah and I gave them a lot
of freedom to design the curricula and I really think of the work
as more their accomlishments than ours.

Planning for the conference was straightforward.  I asked the
Academic Support Assistant for Computer Science [5] to make hotel
and travel arrangements for the students and I thought everything
was set.  In some years, I would have planned to drive the students.
However, I had administrative responsibilities for the conference
that required me to be there on Tuesday morning and the students
did not need to be there before Wednesday evening.  Forcing the
students to miss an extra day-and-a-half of classes seemed like a
bad idea.

Okay, that's the background.  Now let's explore some versions
of the story.

*The TL;DR version*

Members of the administration cancelled the students' trip to the
conference fifteen minutes after they were supposed to leave with
no explanation and no attempt to contact me or discuss why they were
cancelling the trip.

*The long version, from Sam's perspective*

On Wednesday afternoon, I was on a special tour of the Charles
Babbage Institute arranged for some members of the Conference
Committee.  Since I had a minivan in Minneapolis and the others
didn't, I served as driver for the group.  Being able to tour the
Babbage Institute was a great privilege; it's perhaps the primary
archive of computing history in the world, and we were getting a
behind-the-scenes tour.

About fifteen minutes into the tour, and fifteen minutes after the
students were suppose to be picked up, I got a phone call from one
of my research students [6].  The College driver had not shown up
to pick them up and, when they called FM, they were told that the
trip had been cancelled.  I told them to go check in with the ASA
for CS to try to figure things out.  A few minutes later, the ASA
called me.  I don't remember the exact words, but they were
essentially, "The President has cancelled their trip for weather
concerns."  Stepping away from the Tour for each of those phone
calls was disconcerting; the content of the calls was worse.  But
the ASA for CS is wonderful, and promised to try to figure out a
way to get the students to the conference.

Because I was the primary means of transport, I couldn't really
leave the tour and, as I said, it was an incredibly special opportunity
for me. Plus, I was pretty confident that the ASA would be better
at getting to a solution than I would be.  So I tried to drop the
issue from my head and enjoy the tour.

The moment I got back to the conference, I got a call from my
students.  Three of the eight who were attending had decided to
take a bus to Minneapolis because they didn't want to miss the
opportunity.  I told them that I would pick them up when they arrived
at 4 a.m. the next day.

Then I tried to call President Kington.  He was in a meeting.  I
asked that he call me back.  An hour or so later, I called again.
Eventually, one of the VPs called me.  It appears that there had
been some concerns because of the winter weather [7].  Those were
reasonable concerns; snow makes things dangerous.  But the weather
was currently clear and there were ways to get students back.  (They
had not known that there were five Grinnell faculty at the conference,
including four who had driven.)  They promised to look into other
options for getting the students there.  An hour or so later, they
called back to tell me that they couldn't figure out anything else.

During that time, I was struggling with my primary role for the
conference, that of Student Volunteer Coordinator.  Since I was
about to lose five of our student volunteers, I had to spend a bit
of time rearranging the schedule so that their absence would not be
felt.  

I also had to think about the projects, since I was now stuck giving
one of the presentations.  Fortunately, I had seen a draft of that
presentation.  More importantly, the students who stayed back did
some extra work that afternoon so that it would be easier for me
to present.

I did not sleep well that night, particularly since I knew that I
had to get up at 3:30 or so to pick up the three students who had
decided to take a bus on their own [8].  They arrived looking
exhausted and I brought them to the hotel to check in.  They slept
much of the day, or at least until their shifts.  And they gave an
excellent presentation in the late afternoon.  Mine was also pretty
good.

On Friday, I emailed President Kington to ask why he had not called
me back.  I've include it as an appendix.  I must admit, it was not
the most polite message.  But I was behind on sleep and frustrated.
It appears that his staff had never told him that I'd called.

The rest of the conference was fine.  At the end, I drove the
students home.  I enjoy driving students; I often learn a lot about
them in longer car drives.  We talked about a host of things, such
as why we excuse students from class for religious obligations but
not cultural ones [9].  As I said, I learn a lot from Grinnell
students.

Back on campus, I continued dialogue about the events with
administrators.  I never got a real explanation about how the
decision was made and, more importantly, why no one bothered
to talk with me, or the students, or the ASA while options were
being considered.  I also continued to express frustration that
no one had thought to notify the students that the trip was 
cancelled or to apologize.  Eventually, after a month or so, my
students got an apology.  A bit later, I got some concessions from
the administration.

But I never got a real explanation as to why no one consulted us
along the way.

*The students' story*

I don't really know everything about the students' experience.
Nonetheless, I am doing my best to present it from their perspective.

Wednesday at 1:00 p.m.  Where's the bus?  We were told to be here
on time.  Why can't the College do the same?

Wenesday at 1:10 p.m.

*Another perspective*

*Sam's frustrations*

I've expressed most of my frustrations in the notes above and in the
letter to president Kington.  There was no real consultation.  There
seems to have been no consideration of the import of the conference
to students.  Grinnell says that student research is important; 
presenting that research is also important.  Why didn't anyone consider
the very different kind of risk of students not being able to present?

*Appendix: Sam's letter to President Kington*

Dear President Kington,

As you might guess, I am feeling quite frustrated.  Although I may
not agree with it, I understand the College's decision to cancel
my students' trip to the SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer
Science Education because of concerns for safety. However, I consider
it quite inappropriate that you made the decision with no advance
notification that these issues were being considered, no consultation
with the affected parties, and no real notification.  My students
should not have been left waiting for their transportation and
learned of the cancellation only when they called security to ask
why it was delayed.

I have traditionally thought of Grinnell as a collaborative
institution.  Presumably, someone could have called or emailed me,
or [the ASA], or my students, in the morning to let us know
that the cancellation was under consideration. Someone could have
asked us to help think through options.  (For example, there are
five Grinnell faculty members at the SIGCSE symposium, three of
whom are driving back to Grinnell at the end of the symposium.)
And, once the decision was made, someone could have notified [the
ASA], my students, and me.  None of that happened.  Once upon a
time, this kind of decision making would have been done with
consultation, or at least notification.

I left a message for you on Wednesday afternoon, once I was out of
session.  You could have returned my phone call either Wednesday
evening, as your staff indicated you would, or at least some time
on Thursday.  At worst, you could have sent me an email.  When you
arrived at Grinnell, you stressed the need for civil discourse.  I
realize that you and I have not always achieved that in our
conversations, but having no discourse is also not civil.

I feel bad for the five of my students who could not attend.  They
were justifiably proud of having their work accepted to the conference.
SIGCSE has traditionally been a quite competitive conference.  This
year's conference was even more so. The conference chairs tell me
that 526 papers were submitted to the conference, and only 169 were
accepted, giving an acceptance rate of under 25%.  While I was able
to present their work for them, I would have preferred that they
be able to do so.  They will not be able to present their work at
another conference, because it is now published.  Nonetheless, I
hope that the College will support them in attending another
conference so that they can have the experience of hearing talks,
participating in discussions, and networking with others.

I have conveyed my apologies to the conference coordinators, who
had to struggle to fill the other roles the students had volunteered
to serve at the conference.

On a more positive note, I am quite thankful that VP [Name] took
additional time in the afternoon to explore options. However, it
should not have taken me calling repeatedly for that to happen.

Finally, I should let you know that the students were presenting
their work related to the Code Camps, work you generously supported
through the Innovation Fund.  Thank you, once again, for that
support.  It really was a great experience for both the elementary
and middle-school students and for the Grinnell students.

In hopes that future decisions are made more collaboratively,

Samuel A. Rebelsky  
Professor of Computer Science

[1] I'd made that claim in one of my musings.  In particular, in 
[my musing on the next President](grinnells-next-president-2019-12-06), 
I wrote,

> I don't know whether or not it's the president's responsibility,
but I'd like to see a president who could take a leadership role
in building bridges between faculty and staff.  I'm not sure all
of the factors that have led to the state, but it seems like both
groups are feeling under-valued and perhaps even undermined by
members of the other group.

[2] And even administrators.

[3] You may be asking yourself why someone would hold a conference
in Minnesota in late February, given that there's bound to be snow.
I'm not sure that I have a good answer.  It may be that rates were
better.

[4] Or at least the text generation and analysis aspects of digital
humanities.

[5] I've been criticized for saying "My ASA", so I use this longer term,
which seems more respectful.

[6] Fortunately, we were not yet down in the archives.

[7] As I said, it was Minnesota in late February.

[8] I don't recall the exact time; just that it was in the middle of
the evening.

[9] E.g., lunar new year celebrations.

I've been thinking a bit about staff governance of late.  Governance
and related issues are complicated matters, and I thought I might learn
a bit by musing on those topics.  As always, I thank those whose comments
and discussions have helped form my thinking.

Let's start with some background.  Most U.S. institutions consider shared
governance and tenure to be core aspects of their academic practice and
their academic identity.  I'll also try to include some Grinnell-specific
aspects of governance.

**Shared Governance**

Shared governance is the concept that the governance of an institution
is shared between multiple groups: The Board of Trustees (or its
equivalent), the Administrators, the Faculty, and, in some places,
Students and Staff.  I tend to approach shared governance from the
perspective of a faculty member: Shared governance suggests that
the faculty should have primary governance over the academic program
and should have a voice or be consulted in decisions that affect
the academic program.  Now, this doesn't mean that the faculty have
complete governance over the academic program; for example, faculty
do not usually get to determine how many positions there are at an
institution nor how much is available for various budgets.  But
they have a voice in these issues and they generally get to decide
on curricular requirements.

[The American Association of University Professors' (AAUP's) statement
on shared
governance](https://www.aaup.org/report/statement-government-colleges-and-universities),
from 1966 or so, says something similar, noting under preliminary
considerations that,

> The variety and complexity of the tasks performed by institutions of higher education produce an inescapable interdependence among governing board, administration, faculty, students, and others. The relationship calls for adequate communication among these components, and full opportunity for appropriate joint planning and effort.

> Joint effort in an academic institution will take a variety of forms appropriate to the kinds of situations encountered. In some instances, an initial exploration or recommendation will be made by the president with consideration by the faculty at a later stage; in other instances, a first and essentially definitive recommendation will be made by the faculty, subject to the endorsement of the president and the governing board. In still others, a substantive contribution can be made when student leaders are responsibly involved in the process. Although the variety of such approaches may be wide, at least two general conclusions regarding joint effort seem clearly warranted: (1) important areas of action involve at one time or another the initiating capacity and decision-making participation of all the institutional components, and (2) differences in the weight of each voice, from one point to the next, should be determined by reference to the responsibility of each component for the particular matter at hand, as developed hereinafter.

The [Association of Governing Boards' 2017 white paper on shared
governance](https://agb.org/sites/default/files/report_2017_shared_governance.pdf) begins,

> Shared governance is one of the basic tenets of higher education, and yet there is considerable evidence  that it is not generally well understood by its primary participants—faculty members, presidents, and members of boards of trustees.1 Shared governance policies, regardless of their clarity or familiarity to key constituents, are central to the operation of most American colleges and universities, and effective shared governance creates a healthy campus environment that can more easily act on needed change and emerging opportunity

The white paper then goes on to note,

> Shared governance is the process by which various constituents (traditionally governing boards, senior administration, and faculty; possibly also staff, students, or others) contribute to decision making related to college or university policy and procedure. When done well, shared governance strengthens the quality of leadership and decision making at an institution, enhances its ability to achieve its vision and to meet strategic goals, and increases the odds that the very best thinking by all parties to shared governance is brought to bear on institutional challenges. When done well, shared governance engenders an institutional culture of collective ownership and accountability for the institution’s present and future. Further, when faculty, administrators, and boards are actively and collaboratively involved in decision-making processes, decisions are implemented more quickly and more effectively. But strong shared governance also takes effort to cultivate and maintain; it is a tradition unique to the higher education sector, but even senior administrators and  faculty—let alone board members, who tend not to be academics5—usually lack formal training on the subject. Knowing how shared governance works, how it should work, or how it might work differently, is not second nature to any of the parties involved in it.

You've probably noted something about both statements.  That is, they
focus primarily on Boards, Faculty, and Administrators.  The AAUP
acknowledges students, but it's a later addition.  The AGB
does note that staff and students can have a voice, but quickly return
to the model of "faculty, administrators, and boards".

I appreciate that the AAUP statement makes it clear that open communication
is core to shared governance.

> Effective planning demands that the broadest possible exchange
of information and opinion should be the rule for communication
among the components of a college or university. The channels of
communication should be established and maintained by joint endeavor.
Distinction should be observed between the institutional system of
communication and the system of responsibility for the making of
decisions.

It often feels to me like this is one of the areas of shared
governance in which Grinnell is doing least well.  We made some
forward progress, particularly with Kate Walker's enthusiasm for
openly sharing information about the College finances, but we've
backslid in recent years.

As I've noted before, another area in which Grinnell seems to be
doing poorly is an attempt to interpret shared governance as
representational governance.  They are not the same thing.  The
Grinnell I started at would never have permitted so many decisions
to be made by committees with no consultation of the broader faculty.

A third problematic area is the role of staff governance, an issue
which I will revisit later in this musing.

**Self Governance**

At Grinnell, Self Governance (or self-gov) is the principle that
our students should have the primary role in governing themselves,
both individually and as a collective.  I've [mused about self-gov
before](self-gov-musings), but consider it worth revisiting here.

I appreciate how one student explained an idealized version
of the concept in a discussion group on the topic.

> Consider, for example, the study rooms in the library.  Some
students attempt to reserve the study rooms by leaving their backpacks
and books in the study rooms.  Other students may get fed up and
remove the backpacks and books.  At many institutions, the way this
issue would get resolved is to ask the library to come up with a
policy.  At Grinnell, we consider it our responsibility to work it
out among ourselves [1].

Views of self-gov are not necessarily consistent.  For example, I
hold up the shared Grinnell Bikes as a case in which self-gov failed;
students did not take good care of the bikes, and some had a practice
of jumping off the bikes when they reached their destination,
allowing them to crash wherever they landed.  Others rode bikes
that were clearly unsafe (e.g., without handlebars), putting not
just themselves, but others in danger.  But when I brought that up
during the discussion of self-gov in new parent orientation [2],
the discussant suggested that the Grinnell Bikes are evidence of the
success of self-gov.  I did not understand the argument, and will not
attempt to replicate it.

I've heard from some alums that self-gov has not always been a big
thing at Grinnell.  But my understanding is the underlying principles
of "students govern themselves" has been there since the late 1960s,
even if the particular term falls into and out of favor.

And, as I've said before, I think our failed slogan of "No Limits" 
did some significant damage to the concept of self-governance because
some students tied the two together, and came up with a variant in
which self-gov meant "there are no limits to how I choose to behave"
rather than "I govern my behavior based on its impact on others and
through shared decisions made with others", or something like that.

**Tenure**

Tenure is a principle enshrined in [the 1940 AAUP Statement on
Principles of Academic Freedom and
Tenure](https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure)
but based on years of prior discussion and practice.  In essence, after
a faculty member has served for a period of time [3], academic institutions 
either commit to keeping that faculty member indefinitely or no longer
retain that faculty member.

From my perspective, tenure serves three important purposes.  First,
it permits faculty to take on important research projects that may
not succeed, that may take a lot of time, or that may create some
controversy.  Too often, academia is driven by "What have you
published lately?"  If your publishing determines whether or not
your employment continues, you will not take on risky projects and
you will choose projects that guarantee that you can publish
regularly.  But there are important projects that can take a decade
or more to produce results, and it is not certain whether or not
results will be there in the end.  In astronomy, for example, it
may take years of observations to gather a deeper understanding of
some phenomenon.  And those observations may not even lead to deeper
understanding.

Second, tenure permits faculty to openly criticize the institution.
Now, you may believe that employees should not criticize their
employer [4].  But a core value of the academic endeavor is that
we improve things, in part, by acknowledging flaws and looking for
ways to resolve those flaws.  If the faculty cannot speak their
mind about the state of their institution, the quality of the
institution will likely gradually deteriorate [5].

Third, tenure permits faculty to speak openly about issues that may
have a political component.  Why should faculty have this right?
Arguably, faculty have deep training and spend a great deal of their
career speaking about topics.  Hence, they will likely have informed
opinions.  However, most topics have a political component, and there's
strong historical evidence that politicians will object to faculty
speaking out in ways that contradict their perspectives, whether
it be about systemic racism, climate change, militaristic approaches
to diplomacy, or the role of computers in damaging the psyche.

Of course, tenure is not necessarily successful at protecting faculty
in all instances.  And some faculty have been known to abuse these
protections.  However, in general, they provide benefits to not only
the institution and its students, but also society as a whole.

The context for tenure has also changed over the years.  Believe
it or not, but there was a time in which many jobs were considered
jobs for life.  That is, you took a position with a company and,
by mutual unstated agreement, you stayed with the company and the
company kept you on [6].  I think it's horrible that this model has
disappeared, for the most; it's a model that I'd like to see us
return to.  Unfortunately, I seem to recall Congress or some other
body deciding that the primary responsibility of most businesses
is their shareholders rather than their employees or their communities.

Another way that the context for tenure has changed, or may have changed,
has to do with compensation.  Faculty members, by and large, earn much
less than those in the other professions.  An MD, a JD from a leading
school, or an MBA would likely lead to higher earnings.  In some fields,
such as Economics or many of the sciences, industry also pays much
better than academia.  Tenure provides a bit of compensation for the
more limited earning one gets from pursuing a career in academia.  Of
course, the freedoms associated with academia, such as the freedom to 
pursue your own choice of research, provide more benefit.  But tenure
preserves those, too.

**Shared Governance and Staff**

I will admit that for most of my time at Grinnell, I have not thought
deeply [8] about the role of staff in shared governance.  As the materials
I've quoted above suggest, shared governance is traditionally thought
of as a sharing between Trustees, Administrators, and Faculty.  I
suppose Administrators are a kind of staff, but it is, nonetheless,
not a model that includes most staff.  Should it?  More precisely,
"This is how folks have always done it" is not a reason to continue
practices.  It's time to revisit the assumptions.

Let's take a step back and reflect on the basic model of shared
governance: Each group has primary authority over its own domain
and a consultative role in domains that touch on its domain.  Many
staff members have their own domains, as it were.  Should they not
have some authority over those domains?  If I try to put myself
into the place of a staff member, I would feel some resentment that
both students and faculty feel like they should have a consultative
role in my domain, at least as it touches on their domains, but I
do not receive the same respect.  It might even feel like students
and faculty act like they have more authority over my domain than
I did.  That's awful.

I expect that there's also a strong sense of a lack of authority
over your own domain.  Faculty make the general policies for faculty,
such as the criteria for raises.  Faculty vote on changes to the
_Faculty Handbook_.  Who has authority over general policies for
staff and the _Staff Handbook_?  HR.  And, as I've mentioned in the
past, HR seems tied to [best practices](best-practices) that appear
to be "best" for the institution, rather than best for our human
resources [9].

**Committees**

Then there's the matter of the committees that affect many aspects
of Grinnell life, or at least Grinnell academic life.  Let's see.
Executive Council has only faculty and selected administrators [10].
Since Council decisions touch on all aspects of the campus, should it
also have an elected member of staff?

The Faculty Personnel Committee also has only the President, the
Dean, and some faculty.  But it makes sense, at least to me, that 
those are the only people who should look at issues of tenure and
promotion.  Similarly, the Faculty Salary Committee only has
faculty representatives.  That Committee does not set the pool for
salaries, but it does get to set general policies and make individual
decisions.  Should a Staff Salary Committee, rather than HR, serve
the same role for staff?  There are fewer faculty than staff, so it
might be difficult.  But a committee could set broader principles.

The Curriculum Committee has the Dean of the College [11], four
faculty, four students, and the Registrar.  I would call the Registrar
an Administrator, rather than a staff member.  I admit that I think
the CC membership is badly designed; since the Curriculum is the
responsibility of the faculty, it should be majority faculty.
I've heard that there have been some votes by the committee in which
the faculty were outvoted.  Perhaps cutting it to two students and
adding a staff member would make sense.  I'm going to add "Figure
out when this membership was designed" to my list of research to do
in the College archives.

The Faculty Organization Committee only has faculty members.  Since
their responsibilities primarily relate to faculty elections, faculty
committees, and the _Handbook_, that makes sense.  Should Staff
Council have a separate organization committee?  I don't know enough
about Staff Council to say for sure.

The Committee on Academic Standing has the Dean [12], five faculty
members, a representative from Student Affairs, a representative
from Academic Advising, the Registrar, and two students.  That
seems like a well-balanced committee.  I'm not sure  how the
representative from Student Affairs and Academic Advising are chosen,
but it strikes me that procedures could be put in place that they
appropriately represent broad staff interests with regards to
academic standing.

The Admission and Student Financial Aid Committee has the Dean,
four faculty members, three students, the Director of Admission,
the Director of Student Financial Aid, and the Dean of Admission and
Financial Aid.  Does this committee need staff beyond the administrators?
I'm not sure.  I'd like to hear arguments one way or the other.

The Instructional Support Committee has six faculty members, the
Dean of the College [14], the Librarian of the College, the Director
of Computer Services [15],  and the Dean of College Services.  Only
the faculty vote.  The committee also gets to invite a lot of other
people to attend when appropriate, including "representatives from
the bookstore, audio-visual department, the faculty secretaries and
other constituencies of the College [...], when relevant issues are
being discussed."  I can see some value in making an ASA representative
a regular member of that committee.

The Physical Education Committee consists of "Chair of the Physical
Education Department; Director of Athletics (non-voting consultant
if not already a member of the committee); two elected faculty
members from outside the Department of Physical Education; and two
students, selected by the Student Government Association."  I'm
intrigued to see that no faculty in the PE department, other than
the Chair, are permitted to serve.  Would staff have a role on this
committee?  Here's another case in which I'd like to see some 
arguments for and against.

The Public Events Committee has "A chair elected by and from the
faculty; two additional faculty members; three students, including
the All Campus Events Programmer and two at-large members appointed
by the Student Government Association; and the Director of the
College’s Performing Arts Program."  I see no reason that there
should not be a staff representative on this committee to help
ensure that our Public Events are also of interest to the staff.
I'm also not sure who directs "the College's Performing Arts
Program". Perhaps that's the chair of Theatre and Dance.

The Teacher Education Committee has "The Chair of the Department
of Education; three faculty members, one from each of the three
divisions of the College; and two students who are earning licensure
for teaching (to be appointed by the Department of Education)."  I
think that's probably fine as it is.

The Committee for the Support of Faculty Scholarship has the Dean
of the College [16] and four elected faculty.  CSFS makes decisions
on issues like funding for conference trips and resources for
research.  I don't think others need a voice in those issues.
However, I know that staff have access to some funds for professional
development but I don't know who gets to make the decisions about
the use of those funds.  I worry that it's either done departmentally,
which may lead to inequities between departments, or by HR, which may
lead to other issues.  I think a Committee for the Support of
Staff Development, or something similar, would be a good addition.

The Committee on Diversity and Inclusion is our most recently
formed committee, and it strikes me that it is a model of committee
membership.  Here's the list, as taken from the _Faculty Handbook_.

> Chief Diversity Officer (co-chair), Director of Intercultural
Affairs or equivalent position (co-chair), the Chair of the Faculty
or their designee from Executive Council, the Head of Human Resources,
one representative elected from each of the three divisions (two
year terms), one representative from Staff Council (two year term),
one representative from the Student Government Association (one
year term), and diversity professionals on campus. Co-chairs may
recommend to the President in consultation with the Faculty
Organization Committee the appointment of any additional members
who are appropriate for the focus, direction, subject matter, or
goals of the committee.

And that's it for the committees that are explicitly mentioned in
the _Faculty Handbook_.  There are dozens more that do not appear
in the _Handbook_.  I have neither the time nor the energy to go
through the broader list.

I must admit that I also don't understand what it means to ask staff
members to serve on these committees.  Service requires time.  They
should be excused from some responsibilities to free that time.
Would that really happen?  I don't know.

**Tenure for Staff**

The other day, I was discussing some of these issues [17] with a
colleague and, as I was discussing the reasons we have tenure for
faculty, I noted that "The Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
likely needs as much protection for their ability to comment and
criticize as faculty do" [18,19].  That is, the right to speak truth to power
belongs to many at the College and not just the faculty, who are protected
by tenure, and the students, who seem relatively secure in their positions.

In contrast, staff members have to deal with the fact that Iowa is
an "at-will" state.  Here's what
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-will_employment) says
about at-will employment.

> At-will employment is a term used in U.S. labor law for contractual relationships in which an employee can be dismissed by an employer for any reason (that is, without having to establish "just cause" for termination), and without warning, as long as the reason is not illegal (e.g. firing because of the employee's race or religion). 

Isn't that comforting? [20]  Would you feel comfortable making public
comments about Grinnell or Grinnell's practices in such a milieu?
I'm not sure I would. I've also heard from some staff members,
including those I would classify as "administrators", that at-will
employment has led them to hold their comments on multiple occasions.

A form of tenure for staff would help address this issue.  Of course, I
have no idea what that would look like.  Nonetheless, just as we have
protections for faculty to speak openly [21], we need protections for staff
to speak openly [22]. 

**Concluding Thoughts**

I realize that my choice to make comments and suggestions represents
yet another instance of a faculty member inserting themselves in a
domain outside of their expertise.  Nonetheless, I find it useful
to reflect on what I would see as some appropriate steps forward,
beyond the necessary broader discussion of these issues.  And, as
someone with privilege, I likely have a responsibility to say
something.

As I reflect on the bigger picture, I'd like to see the staff have
a clear voice in staff governance, particularly in issues like the
_Staff Handbook_ and the policies for raises and such.  I don't
know whether or not Staff Council already serves that role but my
impression is that it does not yet have enough of a role.

It would be good to see staff members on a few of the primary
committees I mentioned above.  I see clear reasons to add a staff
representative to Executive Council, Curriculum Committee, Instructional
Support, and Public Events.  I'm don't think that staff members are
needed on the committees that directly govern faculty, such as the
Faculty Salary Committee.  And there are many committees that I'm
unsure about.  I also don't have the time or energy to explore all
of the committees not explicitly mentioned in the handbook; however,
I see the Convocation Committee as one natural committee which would
benefit from a representative of the staff.

I think I noted above that I'd like to see some committees created
to parallel Faculty committees.  The most obvious ones are parallels
to the Faculty Salary Committee, the Faculty Organization Committee,
and the Committee for the Support of Faculty Scholarship.  Again,
those may already be roles that are covered by Staff Council or that
could be undertaken by Staff Council.

I'm not sure how you provide clear protection to allow staff,
particularly more experienced staff, to speak their minds.  Staff
tenure is an interesting concept, but I doubt that we would undertake
such an endeavor.  Nonetheless, there must be some contractual
arrangement that the College could devise that gives staff rights
beyond at-will employment.  I believe that would also require
that staff have contracts.  I know that the state of faculty contracts
is unclear [23]; I believe staff contracts are in even worse shape.

I wonder what other institutions are reflecting on issues of staff
governance and what they are doing about it.  Knowing that might help
inform our discussions.

Let's hope that our new President and Dean help the College move
forward on those issues and perhaps even make us a leader in staff
governance.  I'm glad to see one clear step forward in that we have
the Chair of Staff Council on the search committee for the new
president.

**_Postscript_**: I see that the Association of Governing Boards has a
publication entitled [_Shared Governance in Times of Change: A Practical Guide for Universities and Colleges_](https://agb.org/product/shared-governance-in-times-of-change-a-practical-guide-for-universities-and-colleges/).  Grinnell
is a member and thus entitled to a free copy of the PDF.  I wonder how
I get a copy.

---

**_Postscript_**: I would be remiss if I did not note that President
Osgood used the _AAUP Principles_ as a reason to disallow the promotion
of Library Faculty to Full Professor.  When Osgood arrived, the
_Faculty Handbook_ noted that Library Faculty received tenure upon
promotion to full professor.  Since most Library Faculty would have
been at Grinnell for much longer than seven years before being
eligible for promotion to full, Grinnell would not be in keeping
with the standard probationary period in the _Principles_ if we
tenured our Library Faculty at that point.

---

**_Postscript_**: I suppose I would also be remiss if I did not acknowledge
that the promotion policy for Library Faculty stemmed from an earlier
College decision.  As I understand it, a Grinnell President [7],
or perhaps the Board of Trustees, decided that we had too many
tenured faculty.  Why was that a concern?  because it was still a time
at which Grinnell was having trouble paying the bills, as it were, and
tenured faculty are hard to dismiss.

As a consequence of the concern, junior faculty in departments with
a high percentage of faculty with tenure were told that it would
not be possible for them to achieve tenure.  Wouldn't that suck?

Eventually, a "compromise" was reached: Physical Education Faculty
would no longer be eligible for tenure and Library Faculty would
only be eligible for tenure after reaching full professor.  I don't
know what that did to the Library and PE faculty who already had
tenure.  But the compromise ensured that the Trustees could be
confident that our obligations were reasonable.

Hmmm.  Now that the College is on more stable financial footing, perhaps we
can consider restoring the possibility of tenure for PE and Library
faculty.  However, that's a subject for another musing.

---

**_Postscript_**: I look forward to the release of Joe Wall's _History of
Grinnell in the 20th Century_ so that I can better understand
the issues raised in the prior postscript.

---

**_Postscript_**: Sometime over the next few days, I'll be ranting about
something to do with staff.  Please keep any positive feelings from
this musing in mind when you read that rant.

---

**_Postscript_**: A dialog.

Wife: What are you doing?

Husband: Writing.

Wife: What are you writing?

Husband: A long musing.

Wife: Have you been writing the same musing for the whole time you've
been at the computer?

Husband: Um, yeah.

Wife: I should warn you that I rarely get to the end of your longer
musings.  And don't forget
that you have [homework to do for
Tuesday](https://www.midwayisd.org/cms/lib/TX01000662/Centricity/Domain/115/The_Wreck_of_Time.pdf)
[24].

Husband (much later): I wonder if she reached this postscript?  

---

**_Postscript_**: I had not anticipated this musing becoming quite
this long.  I'm surprised to see that it's even longer than my
[too-long reflections after preregistration for spring
2020](post-prereg-2020S).  I expect this is among the last lazy
Sundays that I will have to write long musings.

---

**_Postscript_**: I'm also not sure that this musing had to be this
long.  Okay, I'm pretty sure that it didn't need to be this long.
At times, I think I would benefit from a good editor.
But there are also times that I manage to edit myself.  This just
isn't one of those latter times.

---

**_Postscript_**: I used the tag "postscripted" to indicate that this musing
had far beyond its fair share of postscripts.  When I added that tag, 
I had one or two more that I then deleted.

of self-governance when we had [the legendary Brandy Agerbeck
'96](brandy-agerbeck) back on campus to help diagram the conversations.

children started at Grinnell.

[15] Do we still have one of those?

[16] In this case, the _Handbook_ does *not* say "or a designated

[18] In the comment, I identified them by name, rather than title.

[19] I do not know that our Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
has particular comments that they feel unable to make.  However, they
have both knowledge and opinions on important areas in which Grinnell
has clear flaws.  Hence, they seemed like a good example for me to use
as I was talking with my colleague.

[20] Did the sarcasm come through?

[21] At least in matters of their expertise.

[23] I hope to hear an update on faculty contracts this semester.

[24] Can you believe I went on a side quest to find the original

more about the books quoted in the article?  And did you know that
there are at least two versions of David Von Drehle's _Among the
Lowest of the Dead_ with different subtitles, one that seems to be
a tenth-anniversary rewriting [25]?

[25] Or at least that has a new tenth-anniversary preface.

Sitting in the waiting room at the hospital, day after day, unsure
if things will ever change.   Having an alarm go off fifteen minutes
before class, realizing that I've forgotten to prepare, or even
that I was teaching class that day.  Missing my session at a
conference because I was out with friends and forgot I had
responsibilities.  Returning to the house on Billings park only to
find that it hasn't changed, except for an important absent presence.
A spinning body, high in the air, too close to a fiberglass board.
Looking down at myself during a major presentation and realizing
that I've forgotten to wear clothes.  These are the kinds of things
that haunt my dreams.

Two new candidates hope to join the list: Having to present my
writing in a Grinnell writing workshop and coping with my inability
to go beyond trite beginnings.

My first writing assignment in _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_
is due on Tuesday, 11 February 2020.  Why don't I write *our* first
writing assignment is due then?  Because we workshop pieces, and
so only a few pieces are due at a time.  In addition, by spreading
out the due dates, Prof. S is able to get us to write in different
genres and subgenres.  I'm in group 2B, the first group that is
tasked to write about travel or place.

We workshopped the first manuscripts, which were memoirs, last
Tuesday.  I feel fortunate that mine was not one of the first pieces;
it's always intimidating to go first.  As an instructor, I am tempted
to be a bit kinder to those who have to precede their peers.  But
I find that I often end up being particularly critical, at least
in public, so that their peers don't repeat their mistakes.  Maybe
I'm kinder in the grading, if not the public criticisms.

I wasn't quite sure how to respond to the works.  We were reading
memoirs, all of which were painful in some way.  How do you comfortably
critique memoir writing?  "You didn't twist the knife hard enough
at this point."  "Readers will have trouble believing this important
scene in your life."  "Your life story seems trite."  "The metaphor
you've chosen for your life falls short of your goals."

In any case, I found myself impressed by the ways in which the
students in the class approached the workshop.  Most had read the
pieces multiple times. And they had read them closely.  I heard
careful and clever comments about sentence structure, the rhythm
of the pieces, vocabulary and word choice, and so much more.  The
student who I think of as "Ralph Jr." [1] would often make a pointed
criticism and then Professor Savarese would note that he was going
to say the same thing.  Students brought in sociology, queer and
feminist theory, and other things I couldn't comprehend. A poet in
the class paid close attention to language.  And they did so in a
way that was supportive, rather than undermining.

I shouldn't have been surprised.  They are, after all, Grinnell
students.  And I shouldn't have been suprised at the effort that
went into the writing, from powerful metaphors to careful language
choice.

I put my writing before a public audience each day.  That should make
me a bit more confident in putting it before this class.  But I put
my musings before people to share thoughts, not to get comments on
my writing.  It feels very different.

You'd also think that a workshop that I described as supportive
would not be intimidating or frightening.  But I know that my
creative writing needs work, particularly because I have trouble
with so many aspects of creative writing: metaphor, structure,
variation, ambiguity, more than I can hope to list.  While I know
I learn from criticisms, particularlyl the quality I epxect from
this class, I worry about how many I'll get.

I'm also finding it hard not to include a page or more of questions
along with my manuscript.  I have five potential titles.  Which do
you think is best?  Or do you have another suggestion?  What do you
see as the point of this piece?  I did not intend to link Zoe
Leonard's _I want a president_ to President Kington.  However, I
mention Kington twice in the piece.  Is it okay?  Have I gone
overboard in the paragraph that I've lifted from the psyche?  I
want to ask.

What does a writing assignment look like for this class?  Not like
I'd expected.  It goes something like this.

> Pick one of the pieces that we've read in this genre or subgenre.

> Identify some techniques the writer uses in that piece and assign
  yourself to use them in your piece.

> Write a five-to-six page piece.

The structure of the assignment reveals both simplicity and complexity.
We are mimicing parts of a professional piece of writing, but we
are not to mimic the overall piece.  Not so much chameleons as, um,
something else.  The twin tasks of identifying structural and
stylistic elements and then attempting to replicate them should
help us grow as writers, provided that those atttempts do not appear
forced.

What pieces can I choose between?  That's more complicated than it
might seem.  We are reading and discussing about a dozen travel/place
pieces.  However, we had only read and discussed three of them by
the time I started writing [2].  It seemed best to choose among those
three, or perhaps the set we were to talk about on the 11th.  What
did I choose?  Stay tuned for tomorrow's musing, when I write myself
an assignment.

I turned in my manuscript today.  I look forward to hearing from my
colleagues.  I just hope I remember to wear clothes.

**_Postscript_**: One potential advantage of writing for Ralph's
course is that it gives me subjects for multiple musings.  In fact,
that was supposed to be the topic of this piece.  As we've seen,
my writing strays.  But there's a good chance that you'll see a
musing about my assignment, the piece I wrote, some reflections on
writing the piece, some further reflections on editing the piece,
a summary of the experience of being workshopped, a summary of my
peers' comments [3], and a musing or two on writing issues [4].
At the end of the semester, you may see my rewrite, comments on the
steps involved in the rewrite, things like that.  Along with this
piece, that makes somewhere between eight and ten musings for one
short piece of nonfiction.  Not bad!

Please let me know when you get bored.

**_Postscript_** I originally started this with my more typical "I'm
taking ENG-207.  Now I have to write my first assignment."  But my brain
wouldn't let me do that.  Is this new structure any better?  I'm not
sure.  I'm coming to feel that I've managed to replicate my standard
structure, albeit in a slightly different form.

[1] I mentioned it to them; they laughed.

[2] I was intimidated enough that I thought I should start writing on 
February 6.  I'm on my fourth draft.  I'm not sure you can tell.

[3] As long as that's okay with Ralph.

[4] I've already started one about sentence structures.

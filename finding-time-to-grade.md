When can I grade?
=================

*Or ... Sam whines again.*

I'm behind on grading.  More precisely, I'm *way* behind on grading.
I have three classes in which I'm about to distribute take-home exams.
I don't like distributing new exams without returning the previous exam.
But I haven't finished grading.  The question I face is **When can I
find the time to grade?**  Let's consider the past few days.

I have more to do than grade and my regular work.  For example, I needed
to get a recommendation letter done.  I needed to finish my [triennial
review report](index-salary-reviews).  I had email to read.  I had some
other paperwork that I've now forgotten.  What did my Thursday schedule
look like?

* I had a class from 8:30 to 11:00.
* I planned to attend Scholars Convocation from 11:00 to 12:00.
* I had the weekly meeting of the Scheme Squad [1] from 12:00 to 1:00.
* I had office hours from 1:30 to 3:00.
* I had to shop and set up for CS extras 3:00 to 4:00 [2].
* I planned to attend the CS extra from 4:00 to 5:00 [4].
* I attended a sports banquet from 5:00 to 7:00 [5].
* I attended the high school play from 7:30 to 10:00 [6].

That didn't leave much time to do much of anything, let alone grade.
Somehow, I found time to get the recommendation letter done.  I finished
my salary review after returning from the play.

Friday and Saturday, I took students to the Missouri-Iowa-Nebraska-Kansas
Celebration of Women in Computing (MINK-WIC).  We left Grinnell before
8:00 a.m. on Friday.  I had planned to be back in Grinnell in the late
afternoon on Saturday.  But the Career Fair ran long and our "quick stop"
for dinner took longer than any of us had planned.  So I didn't get home
until 10:30 p.m. Saturday night.

Sunday (today), I had work to do around the house [7].  With preregistration
coming, I had to check in with my advisees.  I had a variety of email
issues to deal with.  We have a faculty meeting and department meeting on 
on Monday and I needed to think about some materials for those meetings. 
But I also got some grading done, just not enough.   

Thursday was atypical only in that my evening was booked.  Most of
my weekdays are booked from 8:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. or after [8].
I have an exam to write and a project to design.

I've yet to figure out the solution to this problem: *When can I grade?*
It's not fair to my students that they aren't getting work back.  But
I really have no idea how to get the grading done in the midst of my
other work.

Oh well, at least there are only five weeks left in the semester (plus
finals).  Next semester will be much more reasonable.

[1] The faculty and mentors for CSC 151.

[2] Why am I shopping and setting up for talks?  Our department budget
will not allow us to hire catering.  College policy will not allow us
to send a student or staff member.  Hence, a faculty member needs to do
the shopping and setup for our talks [3].

[3] Now that I think about it, I might be able to hire a student to do
the setup and cleanup.  I'll talk to the Chair about that.

[4] I wasn't able to attend because of a family errand I needed to run.

[5] I believe in supporting my children in their activities.

[6] Once again, I believe in supporting my children in their activities.
The play runs three nights, but I was unavailable Friday and Saturday night.

[7] I did some, but not all.

[8] This week, on MWF I have CSC 151 8:30-9:50, CSC 301 from 11:00-11:50,
a meeting from 12:00-1:00, CSC 151 from 1:00-2:30, office hours from
2:30 to 3:45, and a meeting from 4:00-5:00 or so.  10:00-11:00 is supposed
to be time to prepare class.

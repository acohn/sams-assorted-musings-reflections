I've never really wanted an Apple Watch.  For the past few years,
I've been quite happy with my Pebble [1].  It does what I want a
"smart" watch to do: It tells the time and it tells me when I have
text messages and phone calls [2].  But my Pebble is aging: It only
holds a charge for about a day and is starting to experience what
folks call "screen tearing".  So when someone offered to give me
their used Apple Watch because Apple would only give them $50 for
a trade-in, I figured that it was worth trying out, even though
it's rose gold, which isn't traditionally my color [3].


I don't tend to take use of [or even like] the newest technology.
Most of my needs are simple.  But I've found a few things about the
Apple Watch that I like, other than that it tells time and tells
me when I get text messages.  Perhaps most importantly, it's quite
easy to set a ten-minute timer, which means that I am finally
following my mother's advice to stand up regularly.  That's good
for my health.  Surprisingly, the concentric circles have also been
good for my health.  That is, I've been encouraged to complete the
expected mount of exercise and standing, and to burn enough calories.
The third thing I like about my Apple Watch is that it makes it
especially easy to approve a Duo connection.  Since I do that a few
times a day, the watch makes my life better.

Does it have other features?  I'm not sure.  But I can tell you that
my Pebble Steel did a better job of telling me when I have text 
messages [4].

Postscript: Why didn't they call it an iWatch?  Perhaps that sounds
too creepy; it seems to reveal a bit too much of how our technology
watches us.

[1] well, Pebble Steel, to be precise.  

[2] I would not want it to tell me when I have email messages; I
get way too many of those each day.

[3] I have a nice red strap for it, too.

[4] The Apple Watch does not vibrate as much.  And it only tells me
about messages when my phone is not open [5].  The Pebble told me
about all messages.

[5] Or whatever the term is.

Writers at Grinnell (and other events at Grinnell)
==================================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), short, autobiographical*

This evening, I attended the inaugural reading of this year's
[Writers at
Grinnell](https://www.grinnell.edu/life-grinnell/arts-culture/writersgrinnell)
season.  The poet [Danez
Smith](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/danez-smith) read
from their works [1] and answered questions [3].  Writers at Grinnell,
or Writers@Grinnell, as it's often written, is one of the more
valuable traditions at Grinnell; it exposes Grinnell students to a
variety of writers and it exposes those same writers to Grinnell [4].

After I sat down, I saw two of my students [6] in the row in front of me.
We had the following dialogue:

> Student: Sam [7], what are you teaching this semester?

> Me: Nothing, I'm on [sabbatical](sabbatical-2019-08-30)

> Student: Then why are you here?

I was a bit stunned by the question.  My short answer was,

> Me: Because I have time.

What I was thinking was,

> _Because sabbatical gives me the time to attend the events I want
to attend; I'm not bogged down with class prep, grading, answering
student email, or dealing with paperwork_ [8].  _That means I can
go to events like this without feeling like I'm letting something else
slide._

Upon further reflection, the intended question may have been "Why
are you *in Grinnell*?", as in "Why are you doing your sabbatical
in Grinnell?"  Unfortunately, I didn't realize that until now.  The
easy answer is that Michelle couldn't leave town and I don't
particularly enjoy leaving my wife for long stretches of time.

I'm actually quite happy to be in Grinnell, in part because I have the
opportunity to do some of the things that I don't have time to do in
many semesters: attend talks, go to concerts, watch athletic events,
and more.  I am able to do some of those things each year [9], but I 
look forward to being able to do much more.  I expect I'll be able to make
all of the events in the [Rosenfield _Tyranny of Data_ Symposium](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/centers-programs/rosenfield/events) [10]

This Thursday is going to be a challenge.  There's a talk on Restorative
Practices from 11:00-12:30.  There's the first of our Data Seminar Series,
with the new Sidney Meyer Professor, at 12:00.  I'm not sure how I can
do both.  I'm also not sure how Michelle will feel about going to see
volleyball on Friday night.  Oh well, I'll take each event as it comes.

Postscript: I'm planning to attend most of this year's Writers@Grinnell
series because it fits into my vision of weekly Convocation.  There are
currently about five Convocations each semester.  If we add five
Writers@Grinnell events each semester, that leaves us with four or so
additional events to plan.  We could easily fill those with Grinnell
faculty and staff: Vince Eckhart on the pronunciation of "niche",
Dean Harris on the relationship of medieval forestry law to faculty
events in the husk, Bill Ferguson on Monopoly and other games,
and so many more [11,12].

---

Postscript: One of my early-career colleagues said something about my
Convocation rant.  I noted that I was surprised to hear that they
read my musings.  They said something like "Lots of people read your
musings".  I think that there was an implication that I should be
cautious.  Should I worry that ECF [15] treat my musings as an
opportunity to jest at my foibles and self-centered writing?  I hope
not; let's pretend that they treat them as an opportunity to learn
more about the College.

---

Postscript: When I left for the reading, I was trying to figure out
what I would muse about tonight, particularly since I expected to
have limited time to muse.  While I have a few short musings in the
queue, including one on lamejun and another one on color blindness
[16], most are autobiographical and I feel like I've been writing
too many autobiographical musings recently.  I planned to return
to a previously-set-aside rant about our new computing policies.
Fortunately, the conversation at the reading provided ample fodder
for this musing, so I can give the Dean's office a bit more time
to deal with the issue.  I suppose this musing is also a bit
autobiographical, too.  I guess that's just how musing goes.

---

Postscript: One of my favorite (approximate [17]) quotations from the Q&A 
session: "Writing poetry is easy; it's the editing that's hard."

---

Postscript: I suppose I should have also identified this musing as
rambly.  However, at this point, it seems that most of my musings
are rambly.  At least I managed to leave most of the rambling to
the postscript.

[1] And performed their works without needing to read [2].

[2] And revealed the impacts of aging by having to look up some parts
of one of their most powerful poems.

[3] After giving a list of questions that they would not answer.

[4] The [Writers@Grinnell page](https://www.grinnell.edu/life-grinnell/arts-culture/writersgrinnell) includes a captioned video in which Ralph Savarese,
Dean Bakopoulus, and other folks more articulate than I describe the 
benefits of the program [5].

[5] Why is the image used to start the video a picture of an
unidentified white male, a stack of books, and a dusty old
typewriter?  I have no idea.  Maybe Dean or Ralph will explain.

<img src="images/writers-at-grinnell" width="600" alt="A person who presents as a right-handed white male sits in a wooden chair with a pen in hand and a notebook on lap.  In the foreground sits an out-of-focus dusty old mechanical typewriter.  On a stand are five books: A used copy of George Sanders' _Congratulations, by the Way, Stuart Dybek's _I Sailed with Magellan_, Robert Bolaño's _The Savage Detectives_, a beat-up copy of _The Scribner Anthology of Short Fiction_, and a red hardback tome whose name I cannot decipher.  Next to the books is a black cap with the Honor-G symbol."/>

[6] I identify students who have taken a class with me or done research 
with me as "my students".

[7] Yes, I encourage my students to address me by first name.

[8] I don't mind doing any of those things.  However, they don't
generally leave me with a lot of free time.

[9] For example, I think I managed to attend four showings of _Salt 
Marsh Suite_ last spring.  It wasn't enough.

[10] I don't see a separate page for the symposium, so I've used the
Rosenfield events page.  I assume that the link will point to something
less relevant in the future.  For posterity's sake, I've added an appendix 
giving the details.

[11] Those were attempts at humor.  I expect that few folks, other than
me, will understand the humor.  But that's how things go with Dad jokes.

[12] I've seen both Vince and Bill [14] give excellent talks on
their scholarship at the annual Faculty Scholarship event.  Anne
is clearly a great speaker.  I've also seen many of our younger
faculty give wonderful talks that could easily be expanded to a
Convocation.

[14] And Leslie and Shonda and Tyler.

[15] Early-career faculty (and staff).

[16] I was tested today.  I am incontrovertibly red-green color-blind.

[17] Potentially imagined, since my hearing is going.

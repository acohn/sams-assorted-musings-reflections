In the most recent installment of _The Rebelsky Book Club_, the
Rebelsky family read and discussed Erin Morgenstern's [1] _The
Starless Sea_.  For those of you who have forgotten, the Rebelsky
Book Club is an opportunity for the five members of our Rebelsky
clan to sit down and discuss a book.  We started with Carol Dweck's
_Mindset_.  I think _The Starless Sea_ is our eleventh book and our
third or fourth work of fiction.

It was my turn to choose, so I deserve the blame or the credit for
choosing this book [2].  I will admit that it was a hard choice,
not least because I was only 20% through the book when I had to
choose a book.  Nonetheless, at that point, I knew that Morgenstern
can be a wonderfully lyrical writer and that the book contains
cleverly interlinked sets of interrelated and interreferential [3]
stories.

Writing about the book is hard.  It doesn't help that Morgenstern
has one of her characters say "**Books are always better when read
rather than explained**" [4,5].  And so perhaps I should not say much,
other than to repeat that I appreciated the lyricism and the
interlinked parts of the work [6].

Plus it has cats.

And a pirate [7].

You should read it.

**_Postscript_**: I would be negligent if I did not mention that
my family expressed some concern that the Kindle edition has some
sentences that lack grammatical clarity.  For example, "Whatever
you are seeking here you will not find it" (p. 255) could be "Whatever
you are seeking here, you will not find it" or "Whatever you are
seeking, here you will not find it", which mean somewhat different
things.

**_Postscript_**: The always acquisitive SamR wonders if the book has
enough meaning that I'd like to acquire a signed copy from Morgenstern's
local bookstore, which is relatively close to Eldest Son.  Of course,
the bookstore is probably not open right now and it sounds like she's
not currently signing copies [8].

[1] I have no idea whether or not she's related to S. Morgenstern.  At
times, it feels that way.

[2] Since our consensus was "This book was worth reading", I'll choose to
take credit.

[3] Perhaps even more so than my endnotes.

[4] Morgenstern does not boldface that quotation.

[5] p. 224.

[6] It's sufficiently interlinked that it feels like you will gain
more upon repeated readings.

[7] I do not believe it is the Dread Pirate Roberts, but you can never
be sure.  Or at least I can never be sure.

[8] Or perhaps they can't get copies back and forth.  It's a puzzling 
time.

Dear Concerned Alumni,

Congratulations!  As you can tell from [the latest Honor Roll of
Giving](https://alumni.grinnell.edu/giving-to-grinnell/impact-2019-honor-roll),
the College is no longer receiving donations from the Brownell
family.  It appears that your efforts have had the intended impact.

As you know, I do not agree with your assessment of the Brownell
family.  Nonetheless, I do understand your desire for Grinnell to
limit donations from those who do not subscribe to Grinnell's values;
there are many whose donations I would protest.

But that's not the point of this note.  Rather, I'd like to write
about Project Ignite.  As I expect you know, since it was one of
the criticisms raised, the Brownell's donation supported Project
Ignite, an outreach program intended to give educational enrichment
to area children.  I've heard that enrichment programs, or the lack
thereof, are one of the things that are contributing to the increased
educational divide in our country (and, therefore, to the increased
financial divide).  Parents with a certain amount of wealth, or
in certain areas, have access to enrichment programs.  Others do
not.  I know from my own experience that poor and middle-class
families in the middle of Iowa do not have easy access.  I'm proud
that President Kington and the College found a way to provide
enrichment to our community and I'm proud of the various outreach
and enrichment activities the College continues to support and
provide.

The Grinnell College students I know who have participated in Project
Ignite have told me that they found it valuable.  Not only did they
have the opportunity to serve our community in an important way,
but they also had the joy of interacting with children and, in many
cases, they learned something in developing activities for those
children.

As I understand it, with the loss of the Brownells' donations, the
College has no direct funding for Project Ignite.  In my informal
conversations with folks in our Office of Community Enhancement,
I've learned that we have found temporary ways to continue to fund
the program.  However, I must assume that that money comes from
somewhere else, presumably from other community outreach and community
enhancement programs.

Hence, I have a request for you.  Since the College no longer receives
Brownell money to support Project Ignite, would you please donate to fund
the program.  I know that children and parents in our community would
very much appreciate it.

With thanks for your assistance in this important matter,

Samuel A. Rebelsky

Thirty-one years
================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), very short*

Michelle and I were married thirty-one years ago today.  I remained
thrilled that this wonderful, caring, thoughtful, brilliant, beautiful
woman agreed to be my wife.  (I'm also thrilled by the three wonderful
sons we've raised together.)

Thanks, Michelle, for putting up with me through everything!

Here's to at least another thirty-one years.

Postscript: Thank you very much to the secret benefactor who treated us
to dinner at Prairie Canary this evening.

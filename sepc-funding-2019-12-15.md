SEPC funding
============

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell)*

Grinnell's _Student Educational Policy Committees_, or SEPCs, form an
important part of the Grinnell academic program.  SEPCs have a variety
of responsibilities and activities; two of their most important
ones are to provide input to the department on personnel issues (e.g.,
hiring and promotion) and to build community in the department.  As
you might guess, many community-building activities take money, so 
SEPCs need budgets.

I've heard that there is a movement to change SEPC funding from the
current model of so-many-dollars-per-major.  That change may be
tied to the [Student Government Association's (SGA's) work on revising
policies and practices for student
groups](http://www.thesandb.com/article/change-is-coming-to-student-groups.html).  I thought I might add my two cents to the conversation.

I will admit that it's hard for me to be neutral about SEPC funding.
Computer Science was screwed by the funding system for much of my time
as department chair.  I recall asking why our funds had run out so
quickly, and discovering that they had under-counted the number of
majors by about half.  When I pointed out the mistake and asked
that our SEPC receive the funds they deserved, I was told "Sorry,
we can't make any changes." I hope that the under-counting wasn't
intentional, but it sometimes felt like people had it out for my
department.  In any case, I dealt with the issue as I often do, by
saying "That's okay, we'll just use the department's restricted
fund" [1].

I don't know all of the details of the change.  As I understand it,
while there would be some amount available per major, there would
also be additional funds available by application that are not tied
to the number of majors.  That kind of change makes sense to me.
There are certainly some departments that serve a disproportionate
number of students.  The Department of Mathematics and Statistics
is often identified as a key service department because of the
number of students who take Calculus or Statistics 209.  But there
are many others.  For example, Chemistry appears to have a comparatively
small number of majors, but it handles a very large number of
Biological Chemistry majors [4].  Switching divisions, our Music
Department has very few majors, but large numbers of students are
involved in music, whether through lessons [5] or ensembles.  I've
heard that at their last study break, attendees claimed about 120
plastic flutes, which is about a factor of six times the number of
majors they have [6].

SEPCs also seem to vary significantly in the amount of activity
they support.  Some seem quite active.  For example, the CS SEPC
not only runs a weekly study break for students but also conducts
regular professional development sessions.  I'm not sure how you
adjust for that in funding, which suggests that an application-based
model makes some sense.

There's also another financial issue related to SEPCs that I don't
feel gets discussed much.  Particularly as Grinnell explores ways
to ensure that students are compensated for their work [7], it's
worth considering whether the members of the SEPC should be compensated
for some of their time, particularly the time spent reviewing
candidates and faculty.

I guess that's it for my opinions [8].  I suppose I should do a bit more
background research on current SEPC guidelines, but I don't know where
to look since Student Affairs carelessly excised all of the SEPC guidelines
from the _Student Handbook_.  I'm hoping that I can find them when I return
to my role as Department Chair; they were not readily available [10] the
last time I served as Chair.

[1] I always find that the term "restricted fund" feels like a bit
of a misnomer.  I realize that the funds are restricted to use by
the department.  However, there are rarely restrictions on how the
department is supposed to use those funds.  As Department Chair, I
preferred not to use them for things I thought the College should
fund directly, such as SEPC activities, the Senior Breakfast with
parents, and CS Table.  But there are times we need to dip into the
fund for those kinds of activities.  Someone also decided that we
need to spend down the fund [2].  Since then, whenever I've given
to a department's restricted fund [3], I've added the note "The
department should not be required to spend this money within any
particular time frame."  I wonder if that makes any difference.

[2] Who cares about saving for a rainy day?

[3] I most frequently give to my department.  But I've also been known to
give to other departments.

[4] Biological Chemistry is usually our second or third largest major.

[5] Every Grinnell student is entitled to one set of weekly lessons per
semester.  While not everyone takes advantage of that wonderful opportunity,
many do.

[6] No, it is not the case that each Music major took six plastic
flutes.

[7] For example, we've started giving stipends to the students who volunteer
to help with pre-orientation programs.

[8] That is, my opinions at this point in time about SEPC funding models.
I have many other opinions about other subjects, and I am likely to develop
more opinions on SEPC funding models as time goes on.

[9] Or perhaps available at all.

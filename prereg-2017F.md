Preregistration (for Fall 2017)
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Registration](index-registration)*

Grinnell's preregistration period is almost done [1].  During prereg,
I successfully registered all 44 of my advisees who needed to register
[2].  It was an interesting process.  Many of them are rising third-year
students who just declared a CS major.  Since we spent a lot of time on
their four-year plans, we didn't have to make many changes [3] and could
sometimes do our work via email.  But some clearly needed to chat.  Some
needed to be reminded to enter their schedules on SelfService.grinnell.edu
[4], our Ellucian site.  Some needed to be reminded to clear holds on
their account.  I also met with some in person, formally during office
hours or informally in a variety of locations [5].  My advisees who are
abroad consulted with me via email.  But I got it done!

That part of prereg took too much mental energy; I'm not yet ready for
the next part of prereg [6].  I probably don't have the time to muse
deeply on any subject.  It's clearly time for the end-of-prereg 
over-enrollment analysis!  I wonder if anyone regularly records 
enrollments at the end of prereg, before we engage in CCB [7].

Well, here goes.  You might be able to play along at
<https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/>.

Katya's _Cultural Politics of Fashion_ is over-enrolled by 10, with
25 people registered for a class intended for fifteen.  It's at an
interesting time (Monday, 7:00-9:50 p.m.) and has an interesting
topic.  It's also a Katya course, which I know many students
appreciate.  Surprisingly, though, her _Shaping American Identity in
Moving Images_ [8] is not over-enrolled.

As seems to be the norm, a section of _Introduction to the Studio_ is 
over-enrolled.  The TuTh morning section has 20 in a course that
can't really hold more than 15.  The MW afternoon section is full.
The MW morning section has room, but I'm guessing that folks can't
switch.  And what happens to the first-years who want to take the
course?

As also seems to be the norm, _Drawing_ is significantly over-enrolled.
There are 32 people enrolled in a fifteen-person class.  I wonder if
Art can find a way to offer another section.

Section 1 of _BIO 251_ is over-enrolled by 23 students, with 47 in a
class that is intended for 24.  Fortunately, there are 8 slots
available in section 2, 16 in section 3, and 4 in section 4.  That
should work out okay.

In contrast, there doesn't seem to be an easy first for the 300-level 
Bio courses.  _Fungal_ is over-enrolled by 8, _Microbiology_ is over-enrolled
by 8, _Pharmacology_ is over-enrolled by 14 [9], _Molecular Biology_ is
over-enrolled by 6.  There's room in _Readings in Biology_.  However, 
it's a two-credit non-lab class.

_Organic Chemistry I_ may be in the worst shape.  Section 1 is
over-enrolled by 32.  Section 2 is over-enrolled by 17.  Section 3 has
one slot.  I'd swear that that's all that existed when I checked earlier
today.  But there's a section 4 with eleven slots.  Still, 32+17 is a
lot bigger than 1+11.  Not surprisingly, the _Organic Chemistry I Lab_
sections are also overfull by a similar amount.  I wonder what Chemistry
will do?  Maybe they should ask the person who spoke up in the Chair's
meeting to say "I'm not sure why departments ask to add sections or
allow courses to over-enroll."  In any case, I wish my colleagues in Chem
success at whatever approach they choose.  I know that they've handled
this issue before, and I'm confident that they can do so again.

Wait!  There are more over-enrollments in Chemistry.  Three extra in
_Instrumental_, four in _PChem I_, two each in the two sections of
_PChem I Lab_.  Knowing my colleagues in Chemistry, they'll just let
these courses over-enroll.

Next up is _History of Ancient Greece_, over-enrolled by 15, with 40 in
a class designed for 25.  It's an [MC](monessa-cummins) course, so it's
not surprising that it's over-enrolled.  Over-enrolled MC courses are
one of the facts of life of Grinnell.

Ooh, we're next!  Let's see what's up with my department.  _Architecture_
is over-enrolled by 14.  I hope we can push those students somewhere else.
Section 2 of _Algorithms_ is over-enrolled by 3, but there's room in
Section 1.  I had anticipated issues, which is why we have two sections.
We'll ask the Registrar to balance those [11].  I hadn't anticipated
over-enrollment in our two _Software Design_ courses, but CSC 321 is
over-enrolled by 7 and CSC 322 is over-enrolled by 11.  However, they are
my courses and I taught them with slightly smaller over-enrollments this
semester. I suppose I can do it once more.  I also had not anticipated
that _Automata, Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity_ would
be over-enrolled.  Its cap is already too high at 24; we really don't
need 26 students in a proof-oriented class.  We'll need to think about 
that one, too [14].

Surprisingly, Economics is in reasonable shape.  I'll need to talk to
their chair about how they achieved that.  _Macroeconomic Analysis_
has one section that is over-enrolled by two, but the other section has
seven slots.  One of their seminars is over-enrolled by one.  However,
since there are a few slots in the other seminars and that Econ normally
places students in seminars, I'm guessing that they decided to allow
one to over-enroll slightly.

_Historical Perspectives on US Education_ is over-enrolled by two.  That
doesn't sound too bad.

We now return you to courses that traditionally over-enroll.  _The
Craft of Fiction_ has 37 students in a class designed for fifteen.
I don't think you can workshop writing well with more than fifteen,
so English will have to do something creative [15].

The next department with over-enrolled classes is History, with two extra
in _History of Modern Middle East_ and fifteen extra in a special topic on
_The Crusades_.  Damn!  I have students who signed up for those classes.
I hope they'll get to stay.  There are also two extra students in
[Sarah](sarah-purcell)'s _19th Century American Pop Culture_.  Knowing
Sarah, they'll get to stay.  Surprisingly, neither _History of Women
in the U.S._ nor _20th Century American Sexualities_ is over-enrolled.
That surprises me; I'm pretty sure that they had huge over-enrollment
when they were last offered.

Are you bored yet?  I'm not.  Believe it or not, but I really enjoy
reading through these things.

Some of our Humanities special topics are over-enrolled.  There are
twelve too many in _Politics of Human Thriving_ and four too many
in _Mental Health Policy and Outreach_.

Next up is Mathematics and Statistics.  Interestingly, _MAT 209:
Applied Statistics_ seems to be in better shape than normal.
One section is over-enrolled by eight and another by five, but the other
section has eight open slots.  Usually all the sections are over-enrolled.
I assume they'll balance and allow a slight over-enrollment.
_Linear_ has one extra in one section, but nine open slots in the
8:00 a.m. section [16].  _Graph Theory_ has eight students too many.
That's a proof-based course, so they'll have to cut some of them.
Fortunately, many of those students can go to _Number Theory_.

Then we hit the upper-level Statistics classes.  Section 1 of
_Statistical Modeling_ is over-enrolled by 21, but section 2 has
ten open slots.  I wonder if they modeled that outcome [17]?
There are also nine students too many in _Prob Stats I_.  The
probability that some students will be cut is high.

In Music, _Music, Mind, & Brain_ has one student too many, and
Mark Laver's _Topics in American Music: Hip Hop_ has five too many.
If I'd paid attention, I would have predicted that Mark's class 
would over-enroll.  But I would have assumed it would be more than
that.

Back to the Sciences, particularly Physics.  One _Modern Physics Lab_
is over-enrolled, but the other has room.  They can balance those.
_Electromagnetic Theory_ is over-enrolled by four, and _Ad Lab_ is
over-enrolled by two.

Political Science, one of the other big majors, naturally has a bunch of
over-enrolled courses: twenty one extra in _Con Law_, twelve in _Politics
of International Relations_, seven in _US Foreign Policymaking Process_,
two in _Political Econ of Developing Countries_.

Now I'm running out of steam.  It's time for a bulleted list
without commentary.

* _PSY 295.01: Health Psychology Across Lifespan_: 33/25 (8 over)
* _PSY 295.02: Cross-Cultural Psychology_: 29/25 (4 over)
* _REL 295.01: The Crusades_: 35/20 (15 over [18])
* _SOC 111.01: Intro Soc_: 26/25 (1 over [19,20,21])
* _SOC 242: Deviance and Social Control_: 44/22 (22 over)
* _SST 295.01: Politics of Human Thriving_: 32/20 (12 over [22])
* _SST 295.03: Ethical Leadership_: 22/20 (2 over)

Did I learn anything doing all of that?  I learned that a few departments
will need to scramble.  I think I found evidence that we need more
faculty members in CS, Statistics, Studio Art, Chemistry, and Biology.
I also discovered that it takes much longer to reflect on over-enrollments
than I thought it would.

I plan to return to this topic after CCB is done to see what's happened
to these classes [23].  I may also return again in the fall, once the first
year students have registered.  That process does not allow courses
to over-enroll without instructor permission, but I can look at what
classes are close to filling.

If you'd like more background about Grinnell's preregistration process,
I wrote about it in [an earlier essay](prereg-2017S).

Damn!  I just realized that the list of course offerings doesn't get
updated after 6:00 p.m.  I wonder how much things have changed since
then.  Oh well, I'll see tomorrow morning.

---

[1] It's 9:00 p.m. on Thursday evening.  Prereg ends at midnight.

[2] I have another nine who will be studying abroad in the fall and
another sixteen who are graduating this year, bringing the grand total
to 69 advisees.  There are also a few first-year students who asked
me to consult on their plans for the fall, but who I do not officially
advise.

[3] I never remember which courses are closed to rising third-year
students and seniors until after first-years register, so we had to
make a few changes to the schedules of students who planned to take
things like Introduction to Sociology or Introduction to Linguistics.
I'm pretty sure that they'll get in to Soc eventually, but I'm not as
sure about Linguistics.

[4] There's probably an essay in that name somewhere.

[5] E.g., during pauses in classes or during lunch.

[6] Cut, close, and balance.

[7] Cut, close, and balance.

[8] It's listed as _Shpng Amer Ident in Mvng Img_.  I guessed at the
expansion.

[9] I hope no students are planning to put Fungal and Pharmacology
together [10]

[10] There's a good story about pharmacological (or at least
psychoactive) mushrooms in the Peter Coyote autobiography.

[11] We may then add some of the students we had to shift from
CSC 211 [12].

[12] It makes me happy that endnote 11 is about CSC 211.

[14] If you are a prospective or current student (or a prospective
or current parent) reading this: Don't worry!  We'll figure something
out.  We always do.

[15] They should not have Dean teach another section.  The world is
much better served by him having time to write another book.

[16] Not surprisingly, most students don't particularly like 
8:00 a.m. classes.

[17] That joke was much better in my head than "on paper".  But I'm
leaving it in anyway.

[18] This course is cross-listed with History.  We don't have two
different courses on the Crusades, although it would be interesting
to have a matched pair with different perspectives.

[19] Students are clearly happy to have Karla back in the classroom.

[20] Fortunately, the other sections have a lot of room.  
  
[21] Yeah, I realize that I said that I was not going to include
comments for the remaining courses.  But this one clearly needed a
comment.

[22] This course is cross-listed with Humanities.  We don't have
two courses with the same names that are over-enrolled by the same
amount.

[23] I should save the current data so that I can tell what changed!

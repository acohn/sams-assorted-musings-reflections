One of the many issues that _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_ is getting
me to think about is the way in which you order a piece.  You don't have
to tell stories in chronological order.  I knew that.  And it's not just
written stories; I already knew that playing with narrative order can make
a big difference in movies.

In any case, the discussion of ordering started me thinking about
the musings.  Part of my style, such as it is, is the structure of
my musings.  I typically start with an introduction that sets the
stage.  Sometimes it's explicit, as in this case.  At other times,
it's a story.  If the introduction goes on for more than a few
paragraphs, I tend to write something like "But that's not the point
of this musing."  Then I go on to reflect for a bit, or to rant for
a bit, or to employ some other r-verb.  I close with a final thought,
comment, or question.  Speaking of questions, I also tend to ask
questions along the way and then answer them.

Does that have to be the way I write?  Let's try something different,
using a tone similar to that of my first work for the aforementioned
class.

You click the link to bring up the next in the series of SamR's
Assorted Musings & Rants.  You chuckle a bit; not at the acronym
itself, but that I think the acronym is amusing.  You know what's
up next.  After a few tags that broadly describe the piece, I'll
set the stage, usually in a paragraph or two.  Sometimes I'll tell
a longer story.  If I write enough, I'll often add "But that's not
the point of this musing".  Then I'll ramble on for a bit.  I'll
go on longer if I have too much to say, or if I have too little to
say.  Along the way, I'll insert asides that only I find humorous,
placing them in endnotes, more often than not.  I'll attempt to
wrap up with a short statement or question.  And you'll be done.
Or perhaps not.  Since I can rarely incorporate everything I want
to say, I'll add a postscript or more.  I may even endnote them.

It's a comfortable rhythm, one you expect.  Perhaps the comfort of
that rhythm is what leads you to read these pieces.  What if I broke
that rhythm.  Rearranged my paragraphs.  Started with my conclusion or
with an uncontextualized narrative.  Failed to conclude.  Made no jokes
Included no endnotes.  Would it surprise you?  Disorient you?  Would
you stop reading?  Would I stop writing?  Or would you be pleased to
finally see some variety, to watch me escape from a deep rut that I
have driven myself into?

I wonder.

But that's not the point of this musing.  No, wait, it is.  What I
meant to say was that's not the structure I normally employ in
musing.  So let's return to the normal structure.

I find myself wondering whether I should experiment more with order.
My typical musing follows an order.  My typical rant follows a
similar order.  Being in the class helped me realize that.  Perhaps
I knew it already.  More importantly, the class makes me ask whether
or not I should continue that order.  Is it essential to my voice?
Does it make it easier for me to write?  My primary goal in musing
has always been to share ideas, information, concerns, and frustrations.
It's often easy to spew a traditionally ordered musing, except,
perhaps, for the final paragraph.  Other orders may make things
more lively, but will it be as easy for you to extract the point?
I also care a bit about how it will affect my audience.  Do some
of you read because you appreciate the predictability?  Will I pick
up other readers if I vary my style?  These are things I must reflect
on.

Oh, wait.  I've reflected on those issues in this musing.  But I have
not come up with a conclusion.  I'll need to reflect more.

What do you think?

**_Postscript_**: This musing is clearly not a normal one:  It lacks
endnotes!

**_Postscript_**: Choosing a strong structure is hard.  Writing good 
sentences is even harder.  When I write for class, I write at less than
one-fourth the rate I write, say, administrative documents.  I don't
muse at quite the rate I write administrivia, but it's still much
faster than my formal creative writing.  Is that speed something I'm
willing to sacrifice?  I'm not sure.

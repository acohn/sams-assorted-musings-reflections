Introduction: Some of SamR's perspectives on software development
=================================================================

**Part of an ongoing series of essays tentatively entitled _Don't embarrass
me, Don't embarrass yourself: Notes on thinking in C and Unix_.**

As I've noted already, the primary focus of this work [1] is trying to
help you understand [some of the ways C programmers approach software
development](cnix-thinking-in-c) and [some of the ways Unix programmers
approach software development](cnix-thinking-in-unix).  As you might
expect, my reporting on thees issues are colored by my own perspectives
and experience.  And so, this work is also probably a reflection of
"Thinking like Sam".  My goal is not to force you to think like me.
However, I do want to warn you that what you see here will clearly
reflect my biases and approaches.

Generalize (example: Sorting)

Diagram and draw.  (Probably won't end up in these essays.)

Elucidate experience (embedded and external) (share stories?)
(Experience is yours and others)

Recall readings

Continue to concentrate on core concepts

Try to test

Explore edges

Document diligently

Choose clarity

Find, foster, and feel fun

L? Like a Language lawyer (look?)

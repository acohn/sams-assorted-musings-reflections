Inbox zero, revisited, stage three
==================================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email)*

As you may recall, this summer I've decided to return to my Sisyphean
question for [the legendary "inbox zero"](inbox-zero-revisited-01).  I
took the easy way out to get started; rather than going through the too-many
messages in my inbox, I declared "inbox bankruptcy" and just shoved them
into a holding place [1].  It's now been about a week and a half since 
that declaration of bankruptcy.  In that time, I've tried my best to keep
up.  I've also unsubscribed from a bunch of mailing lists [2].  But the
mail keeps piling up, particularly since my days were filled with code
camp and not a log of time to read email.

Where do I stand?  I have about 600 messages, about 400 of which
are unread.  That seems like a good afternoon's work.  It's also an
opportunity to unsubscribe from even more stuff.

[1] Of course, technology never works the way it should, so I had some
[complications](inbox-zero-revisited-02) in moving the mail to another
mailbox.

[2] I was telling my family that I had unsubscribed from at least three
sets of game advertisements.  Middle son asked, "Why do you even get three
different sets of game advertisements?"  But I order games from a variety
of different places [3] and each seems to add me to their mailing list when
I order [4].

[3] I'm not sure that I can put together a complete list.  I think
[FunAgain](https://www.funagain.com/) is the place I ordered from
first; they were one of the first online game stores.  [Noble Knight
Games](https://www.nobleknight.com) is a good source for out-of-print
games.  [Miniature Market](https://www.miniaturemarket.com/) has some
good sales, as does [CoolStuffInc](https://www.coolstuffinc.com/).
[BoardGamePrices](https://boardgameprices.com/) provides a good search
engine for the best price on games.  There's a Canadian store I've
ordered from once or twice.  I'm not sure how I ended up on [Troll and
Toad](https://www.trollandtoad.com/)'s mailing list; their focus seems
to be Magic and Yugioh cards.  And I know that there are others.  Yeah, 
I'm definitely an addict.

[4] Note: I have enough games.  I am trying not to order more.

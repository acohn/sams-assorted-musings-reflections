Cart corrals
============

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

I regularly shop at Grinnell's HyVee.  Almost every time I go, I park
next to the car corral and grab a cart for myself [1].  I think it's
polite to have "cart neutral" effect on the corral.  Sometimes, I'll
even bring in two carts, even though I expect to return only one.

Many times I park next to the cart corral, I also get grumpy.  You see,
HyVee has two kinds of carts.  They stock not only the traditional large
trapezoidal carts with a kid seat, but also somewhat smaller carts.  Since
there are two rows on each side of the cart corral, you'd think that people
would put one kind of cart on one side and the other on the other side.
But no, the carts are placed somewhat randomly.

Random placement makes the corral much less efficient, allowing it to
hold perhaps 1/3 as many carts.  It also makes it much harder for the
employees who have to wheel the carts back to the store.

*How hard is it to put the cart in the right corral?*

[1] Exceptions include times I expect to buy very little and times the
weather is such that taking a cart from outside will mess up the store.

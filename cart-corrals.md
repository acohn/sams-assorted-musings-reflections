Cart corrals
============

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

I regularly shop at Grinnell's HyVee.  Almost every time I go, I park
next to the cart corral and grab a cart for myself [1].  I think it's
polite to have "cart neutral" effect on the corral.  Sometimes, I'll
even bring in two carts, even though I expect to return with only one.
When possible, I return with zero.

Many of the times I park next to the cart corral, I also get grumpy.  You
see, HyVee has two kinds of carts.  They stock not only the traditional
large trapezoidal carts with a kid seat, but also somewhat smaller carts.
Since there are two rows on each side of the cart corral, you'd think
that people would put one kind of cart in one row and the other in the
other row.  But no, the carts are placed somewhat haphazardly.

Careless placement makes the corral much less efficient, allowing it to
hold perhaps 1/3 as many carts.  It also makes it much harder for the
employees who have to wheel the carts back to the store.  Instead of
grabbing a row, they need to shuffle the carts.

And so, every time I visit HyVee, I find myself asking *How hard is it
to put the cart in the right corral?*

If I were a better person, I'd ask people that question when I see them
putting the cart in the wrong place.

[1] There exceptions.  For example, I may not grab a cart if I expect
to buy very little and or if the weather is such that taking a cart from
outside will mess up the store.

Name tags
=========

Grinnell [1] recently made the decision to switch the format of our
name tags.  We used to use classy, but not particularly readable, black
and red on brass name tags.  We are switching to less classy, but much
more readable, black and red on white name tags.  I applaud that decision;
I'd rather name tags that people can read.

Along with the change in name tags, we've also
changed the ordering process.  Instead of ordering
directly from the shop in town, we now must go through [an online
storefront](https://marcomcentral.app.pti.com/Total_Choice_Shipping_and_Printing/GrinnellCollege/login.aspx?company_id=22188).
It looks like we were planning the change to the storefront in any case,
but I suspect that I'm partially responsible, given that I convinced the
local shop to issue me a name tag that lists me as "Samuel A. Rebelsky,
Curmudgeon" [2].

All sounds well and good, doesn't it?  We have better looking name tags.
We have a relatively convenient online ordering system.  I happen to think
that Communications should be responsible for the cost of name tags for
individuals on campus, but I accept that departments will have to pay.

But there's a problem.  I consider it an immense problem.

Let me give some context.  Grinnell is an institution of higher education.
Our academic program should be at the center of what we do.  I generally
find that to be the case.  But sometimes offices on campus appear to (a) 
treat themselves as more central than the academic program and (b) show
too little understanding of the academic program.

With that said, let's look at what you can choose as your affiliation
on the new name tags [3,4].

What do you notice about this list?  I notice a few things.  First, we
are incredibly inconsistent about how we name things [7].  Sometimes, we add
the word "Office"; Sometimes, we do not.  When we add it, it can come
at the front or back.  I'm not sure why we don't put "Department" before
or after academic departments [8,9].  I'm really not sure why we have
two entries for the bookstore [10].  I don't understand why some programs
and centers are missing, such as Prairie Studies, the Rosenfield Program,
the Wilson Center, the Center for Humanities, our Title IX office, the new
Institute for Global Engagement [11], and so on and so forth.  Why do we
write "Grinnell College" twice on some name tags---at the top and in the
title of the entity, as in "Grinnell College Golf Course".  But the most
important question the list raises to me is:

**Why doesn't our Office of Communications know the names of the academic
departments?**

What do I mean by that?  There are at least four departments that were
misnamed in the original list: Chinese and Japanese was listed as only
"Chinese" [12]; French and Arabic was listed as only "French" [14];
Mathematics and Statistics had separate listings for "Mathematics"
and "Statistics" [15,16]; and Theatre and Dance was listed as only
"Theatre" [17,18].  I'm not sure why they've separated Art into Studio Art
and Art History, since it's one department with two majors, but I also
don't know whether the Art faculty care.

Two weeks ago, I wrote to the contact person for name tags about these
issues and a variety of others. I have yet to hear a response, not even a
"we're looking into the issues you've raised" [19].  I didn't see any
changes to the site as of two days ago, but as of today they've fixed
the foreign language departments as of this morning.  They have not,
however, fixed the other two departments.  Is it really that hard to
get things right?

Maybe after reading this musing, they'll give me my Curmudgeon name
tag back.

[1] Well, probably the Office of Communications, rather than the College
itself.

[2] No, Communications will not allow me to get a new name tag in that form.
They are no fun whatsoever.

[3] This list is from a few days ago; interestingly, they addressed some
of my concerns in this musing, but not all of them.

[4] Typos are likely mine.  I could not find a way to automatically 
copy into this document.

[5] Misspelled on the sample versions they distributed [6].

[6] Our ASA found it funny that every one of the CS faculty pointed this
misspelling out to her.

[7] Yes, I know, "Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds" or
some such drivel.

[8] Consistency would be nice, but not necessary.  I realize that I sometimes
refer to my department as "The Department of Computer Science" and sometimes
as "The Computer Science Department".

[9] I do see one reason not to use the word "Department"---some of the
academic entities are concentrations.

[10] Grinnell College Bookstore and Pioneer Bookstore.

[11] An institution that gets its own vice president.

[12] That issue has now been fixed.

[14] That issue has also been fixed.

[16] That issue has not been fixed.  Maybe Communications knows something
we don't, and there are institutional plans to create separate a separate
department of Statistics.

[17] That issue has also not been fixed.

[18] The department of Theatre and Dance awards a bachelor's degree only
in Theatre.  There was a proposal last spring to rename the degree, but it
is still under discussion.  Is this another case in which Communications
knows something I don't know?  I hope not; Dance is an incredibly valuable
part of this institution.

[19] It appears that I am misguided in thinking that Communications
should be willing to communicate.

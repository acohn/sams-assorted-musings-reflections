Back from vacation
==================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta), short*

Some of you have been wondering where I've been.  If I recall correctly,
my last musing was about [my allergies](nut-allergies).  I wrote that
musing while on vacation.  Being on vacation made it harder to muse.
It's not so much that I was on vacation, it was issues associated with
being on vacation.  My days were less predictable and generally ended
later than my normal work days [1].  My Internet connection was atrocious
[2].  And so, after three days of trying to muse while on vacation,
I decided that it was appropriate to take a vacation from musing, too.

I returned from the real vacation at about 2:00 a.m. on Monday, June 18 [3].
I spent about eleven hours on Monday running a code camp [4].  I collapsed
after a short dinner.  Tuesday was another long day of code camp.  Tuesday 
night was spent dealing with laptop problems and email.

Today marks a week since I stopped musing.  It's time to start again.
However, tonight is game night at the Rebelsky's [5], which means that
I won't have much time or energy to muse [6].

So, although I'm back, you don't get a long musing. In fact, this is all
you get.  You can cross your fingers that I'll have time and energy after
tomorrow's ten-hour code camp day.

[1] It doesn't help that our dinner service was generally at 8:15 p.m. and
we usually had something to do after dinner.

[2] I drafted a musing about the Internet connection.  Unfortunately, I
think my computer ate it.  If I find it, you'll see it in the next week or
so.

[3] Ah, the joy of delayed flights.

[4] Code camp runs 9:00 to 5:00.  We allow parents to drop off as early as
8:30 and to pick up as late as 5:30.  There's setup beforehand and we do a
daily debrief at the end of the day.  So my day ran from 7:30 to 6:30.

[5] That reminds me that I need to send out an announcement.  [Pause]
Sent.

[6] A full day of code camp plus shopping plus game night leads to a 
very tired Sam.

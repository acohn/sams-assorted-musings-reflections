The state of higher education
=============================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia), UofC, rambly*

The other day, I picked up a book and read the following.

> [T]here is an essential conflict between teaching and research.
Education is synthetic and generalized.  Research is analytical and
detailed.  Education is becoming more generalized.  Research is becoming
more specialized.  The college teacher, after intensive training
in a minute field of physics, is expected to teach a general course in
the natural sciences.  The teacher aims at comprehension.  But in 
the natural sciences in this country alone, 20,000 research workers are
digging up important new facts and announcing new discoveries, some of
which are as yet incomprehensible to their sponsors, to say nothing of
those who are compelled to fit them into an intelligible scheme which
may be communicated to the rising generation.

> Nor is this all.  American education confronts certain national
peculiarities which present almost insoluble problems.  A much larger
proportion of our population gets into higher education than in any
other country on earth.  [...] The number of students has been swelled
in recent years by the association of the formal indicia of education
with certain vocational opportunities. [1]

Those concerns struck me as timely; after all, one of the important
issues associated with the national student-loan crisis is the
increasing necessity of a Bachelor's degree for many jobs [2].
What's the source and the year?  Give me a moment for a quick detour.

At the beginning of the 21st century, as the Web was taking
off, many "popular" talks I heard about the Web and information
management included some part of the following quotation.

> There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence
that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The
investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands
of other workersâ€”conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much
less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly
necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is
correspondingly superficial.

> Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results
of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for
their purpose. If the aggregate time spent in writing scholarly works
and in reading them could be evaluated, the ratio between these amounts
of time might well be startling. Those who conscientiously attempt to
keep abreast of current thought, even in restricted fields, by close and
continuous reading might well shy away from an examination calculated
to show how much of the previous month's efforts could be produced on
call. Mendel's concept of the laws of genetics was lost to the world
for a generation because his publication did not reach the few who were
capable of grasping and extending it; and this sort of catastrophe is
undoubtedly being repeated all about us, as truly significant attainments
become lost in the mass of the inconsequential.

> The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in
view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that
publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real
use of the record. The summation of human experience is being expanded
at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the
consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was
used in the days of square-rigged ships. [3]

The quotation would invariably be followed by a question of the form,
"When was this written?"   I'd usually wait a few minutes for others
to speak until giving "1945" as an answer.  Why did I know the answer?
Because the quotation comes from Vannevar Bush's 1945 article "As We
May Think", which I regularly assigned to my students [4,5].

The presenter's point was invariably that the information explosion
we encounter as new is, well, not so new.

The same holds for the article I was reading.  It's from an article
entitled "Education and Research, I" by Robert M. Hutchins. The text
is a version [7] of a speech he gave at Convocation [8] at the
University of Chicago in June 1934 [9].  

I had always attributed the growth in American higher education to the
GI bill and to the baby boom.  I was therefore surprised to see these
concerns raised so much earlier. You may not be surprised to hear that
his model of "association of the formal indicia of education with certain
vocational opportunities" is different than that of today.  He goes on
to say,

> We shall shortly see the Bachelor's degree required for elementary
teachers and Master's for high-school teachers, as the doctorate is
now almost universally demanded for teachers at the higher levels.
Thanks to such requirements and to similar ones for entrance to
professional schools, American students have in the last forty years
become the most degree-conscious in the world.  They are not to blame.
Colleges and universities have themselves informed them that nobody
can get anywhere in teaching, research, or the so-called "learned"
professions without an appropriate alphabetical series after his name.
And, when to this is added the absolute necessity of having the Bachelor's
degree in order to pass the sacred portals of the local university club,
we can see the forces of both social and economic life conspire to exalt
degrees at the expense of education.

Snarky, isn't he?

I wasn't reading Hutchins to understand the state of education in
the 1930's.  Rather, I've started reflecting, once again, on the form,
meaning, and purpose of a liberal arts education.  I'm reading Hutchins
because his philosophy of education helped shape the University of Chicago
that I attended, because I'd like to reflect a bit on what I understand to
be a long-running debate between Hutchins and John Dewey [10], and because
I know that some of Hutchins' writing supports Grinnell's intent that
a liberal arts education is essential to citizenship.  Hutchins wrote
"The liberal arts are the arts of freedom" [15], and that's the Hutchins
I want to read more of.

Given that it's Hutchins, I'll need to return to the question of the
power of "great books".  It will be a challenge; I acknowledge that the
"great books" of today include a different set of writings and authors
than Hutchins would have chosen.

But those are issues for another day and another musing [17].  For now,
I remain intrigued by this example of things both staying the same and
changing, and I look forward to the challenge and pleasure of reading
more by Hutchins [18].

[1] Since the source of the quoted material is a central subject of the
musing, I will leave the citation until a bit later.

[2] I was going to say "professions".  But profession implies a focused
area, like law or engineering.  As I understand it, the "indicia" of a
degree is now required for a surprising variety of work opportunities,
not all of which would be considered professions.

[3] I'm leaving this one for a bit, too.

[4] I thought I'd mused on the Bush article, but I can't find the
musing.  Right now, all I can point you to is [my notes on my 
early research at Grinnell](annotating-the-web).  Perhaps I'll muse
about it in the future.

[5] I still assign it from time to time, particularly when I get
tasked to give a guest lecture in TEC 154, The Evolution of Technology [6].

[6] Will Grinnell continue to offer that class when the Technology Studies
concentration evolves into Science, Medicine, and Society?  I'm not sure.
It may also take a different form.  However, there is a small chance
I'll get to be lead teacher for the course one more time.

[7] I was not able to determine whether it represents a transcription
of the speech, an edited version of his notes for the speech, or
something else.

[8] Graduation.

from the latter that Hutchins' snarkiness I commented upon earlier was not
atypical.  As part of the debate, Hutchins wrote,

> Mr. John Dewey has devoted much of two recent articles in _The Social Frontier_ to my book, _The Higher Learning in America_. The editors of _The Social Frontier_ have asked me to reply to Mr. Dewey. This I am unable to do, in any real sense, for Mr. Dewey has stated my position in such a way as to lead me to think that I cannot write, and has stated his own in such a way as to make me suspect that I cannot read.

[16] I have a physical copy of _Education for Freedom_ somewhere, but I
think "somewhere" is likely my old office.  I may ask the colleague
now occupying the office if I can get into the office to borrow the book.

[17] Or a few other musings.

[18] And Dewey.

Postscript: Somewhere in my office, I have a book that has ties to Grinnell,
the UofC, and Dewey.  If I recall correctly, they were lectures he gave
at the UofC whose only copies were at Grinnell.  I'll have to dig that
up.

---

Postscript: Grammarly identified way too many "issues" with the text by
Hutchins and Bush.  Sorry, Grammarly, but I'm not going to correct the
writing of others.

---

Postscript: As I reflect back on this piece, I note that I haven't
addressed the issue of the conflict between narrow graduate training and
the broader teaching expectations of faculty, that Hutchins spoke to.
That conflict can be particularly challenging for faculty at a small
liberal arts college.  I'd say "that's a musing for another day", but
I don't really have a strong desire to address the issue at present.

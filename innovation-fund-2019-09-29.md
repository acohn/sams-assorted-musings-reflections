Another last-minute innovation-fund proposal
============================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), things I was writing already*

Two days ago, I shared [my draft Innovation Fund proposal to support
a more humanistic approach to evaluating Grinnell's Individually
Advised Curriculum](innovation-fund-2019-09-27).  Those of you who
read [my most recent set of sabbatical plans](sabbatical-2019-08-30)
may recall that I had planned to write a second Innovation Fund
proposal that focuses on Convocation.  After posting those plans,
I was contacted by a group of others who had similar thoughts.  We
ended up having a series of discussions [1] about the idea and,
along the way, found that a variety of concerns were raised.  And
so we planned to drop the issue, at least for now.

However, once I finished the draft of my first Innovation Fund proposal,
I decided that I really do care enough about changing Convocation that
I considered it appropriate to write a Planning proposal for that project.
Such a proposal would permit more substantive discussions of the
complications and might give us some directions forward.

_**Abstract:** (Up to three sentences, please.)_

Scholars' Convocation plays (or should play) a central role in a
Grinnell education.  However, over the past few years, several
factors have led to declines in both the number of offerings and
in regular attendance at Convocation.  We propose a planning workshop
to investigate two approaches to recentering Scholars' Convocation:
a return to weekly Convocations and a Co-Convocation Course.

_**Project Description:**_

_(What is the project? Include the significance and potential impact of the project, how the project relates to teaching and learning, and the institutional support, equipment or physical resources needed for your project to succeed.)_

Forty years ago, then-President George Drake instituted the tradition
of Scholars' Convocation at Grinnell.  Although Grinnell had had
some regular lecture series, as well as an earlier tradition of
religious convocations, Scholars' Convocation instituted a new
approach to lectures on campus.  With the institution of the "No
Requirements Curriculum" a decade earlier, Grinnell students had
lost the experience of having some common intellectual heritage, a
set of readings or pieces of knowledge shared among all or most
students.  

Scholars' Convocation was intended to address this issue.  Scholars'
Convocation talks intentionally addressed a broad audience.  In
addition, no other events were allowed to be scheduled at the same
time as Convocation.  As a regular opportunity for the campus to
come together for an intellectual purpose, Scholars' Convocation
could expose students to a broad range of topics and, because the
experience was common, give them an opportunity to employ that
broader knowledge in their other academic endeavors.

Unfortunately, today's Scholars' Convocation series no longer
achieves those important and lofty goals.  Many facotrs contribute
to the change.  First, about fifteen years ago, the Faculty voted
to reduce Convocation from twelve or so meetings per semester to
only six.  This year, we have only four in the fall and five in the
spring.  The infrequent offerings make it less likely that students
remember to attend Convocation; when Convocation is weekly, they
know (or should know) that there's an event to attend.  Second, a
scheduling experiment temporarily moved Convocation from 11am on
Thursdays to lunchtime; that change led to a drop-off in attendance
that has continued through the reinstatement of Thursday convocation.
Third, the number of events on campus has increased significantly,
limiting the time many members of the campus community feel they
have available to attend Convocation.  Unfortunately, unlike
Convocation talks, which are designed for a broader audience, these
additional events are often more narrowly focused.  Fourth, although
the general prescription against offering events in conflict with
Convocation remains, some offices on campus flaunt that prescription.
For example, SEPC training was scheduled at the same time as this
year's opening Scholars' Convocation.

In this project, we propose to explore ways to re-center Scholars'
Convocation in the Grinnell Curriculum.  As we have noted, Scholars'
Convocation has the potential to expose the Grinnell community to
a broad range of disciplines and perspectives in such a way that
the knowledge gained from Convocation can inform other learning and
discussion on campus.

We suggest two initial approaches to achieving these goals.  First, we
would like to investigate mechanisms by which Scholars' Convocation
could return to a weekly event.  The proliferation of events on campus
suggests that we should not simply add more talks.  Rather, we would
prefer to consider ways to incorporate in the Convocation series a
variety of other regular talks that are intended for a broad audience,
including the Writers@Grinnell series, talks from the performers
in the Grinnell Events series, some of the distinguished lectures
on campus (e.g., the Chemistry department's Danforth Lecture and
the Classics Department's McKibben Lecture), a repeat of the annual
Faculty Lecture, and departmental lectures that can be addressed
to a general audience.

Second, we propose to develop a one- or two-credit Co-Convocation
seminar that allows students to build upon the weekly Convocation
series.  In this seminar, students will read and discuss papers
related to upcoming Convocation topics and then debrief after
Convocation on both the papers and the talk itself.

It might also be possible to develop a seminar that employs Convocation 
very differently: Rather than focusing on the content of each Convocation,
participants in this seminar might focus on the presentation styles
of the different speakers, reflecting on strategies, strengths, and
weaknesses.  In Grinnell's post-graduation surveys, alumni regularly
report that they would have appreciated deeper grounding in "presentation 
skills".  A Convocation-based seminar might help address that issue.

Because there are many complexities associated with both the broadening
of Convocation and the addition of Convocation-related seminars, we
suggest that we begin with a Planning project.  Our focus will be on
a summer faculty/staff seminar in which we explore the goals of 
Scholars' Convocation, review the past few years sets of events at
Grinnell, propose ways to build weekly Convocation, and design the
seminars.

_**Strategic Goals:**_

_(How would this project contribute to the success of one or more of the College’s six strategic goals? They are Teaching and Learning; Learning Spaces; Enrollment; Post-Graduation Success; Alumni Engagement; and Financial and Human Resource Management.)_

This project aligns most closely with Teaching and Learning.  It provides
a first step in restoring Scholars' Convocation to the center of a Grinnell
education and providing a structure that permits Grinnell students to
receive common exposure to a multitude of disciplines.

_**Diversity and Inclusiveness:** [9]_

_(How does the project contribute to a college community that maintains a diversity of people and perspectives as one of its core values?)_

This model of Scholars' Convocation intentionally exposes students to a variety of perspectives.  We will also consider other mechanisms by which weekly Convocation and the Convocation seminars can contribute to diversity and inclusion.

_**Learning objectives and measurable outcomes:**_

As this is a planning project, we do not anticipate a deep assessment
process.  Our primary objectives are (a) a proof of concept that a weekly
Convocation is possible (e.g., through modeling a past year at
Grinnell) and (b) draft syllabi for one or two Co-Convocation seminars.

_**Describe why the project is innovative and its suitability for the Innovation Fund:**_

_(Why is the proposal uniquely suited to the stated goal of the Innovation Fund rather than other funding sources? Also include risks/challenges and how they may be addressed.)_

As noted above, Scholars' Convocation provides an opportunity to give our
students (and the broader campus community) a common set of intellectual
experiences.  As such, it coheres with the primary goals of the Innovation
Fund.  There would be a possibility of funding through the Summer Workshop
budget; however, workshops funded through that model likely focus more
directly on the building of skills or knowledge among participants.

The greatest risk/challenge in the project is the question of whether we
can develop a model that (a) will not add significantly to the number of
events offered on campus and (b) will encourage people to attend.

_**Describe the project lead's qualifications (and co-leads if applicable):**_

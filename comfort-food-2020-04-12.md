The stresses we are facing are leading many people to crave comfort
foods.  If you'd asked me a week or two ago what my comfort foods
were, I might have mentioned chocolate or corned beef hash and eggs
or potato latkes.  But these past few days, I've found myself
wanting some sweet _lokshen kugel_.  It's strange; I don't think
I've had my mother's [1] kugel [2] since I've moved to Iowa [3].
But it's a dish I miss.  I'm pretty sure the craving was sparked,
in part, by [A _New York Times_ article on Ben Katchor's new book,
_The Dairy Restaurant_], but it's hard to believe that an article
could instill such a strong craving.

Is it appropriate to eat noodle kugel during Passover?  I have no
idea.  At least [one recipe I found
online](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/dave-lieberman/noodle-kugel-recipe-1946564)
started with  "kosher for Passover egg noodles", which suggests it
might be legal.  But I don't know all of the policies and practices.
Of course, I do not generally observe the Passover restrictions, so
perhaps it doesn't matter.  I just didn't want it to feel too wrong.

Unfortunately, mom never passed her recipe (which may have been her
mother's recipe) on to me.  So I had to go searching.  Traditionally,
my mother's recipes either came from _The New York Times Cookbook_
or a late-50's edition of _The Fannie Farmer Cookbook_.  I did find
some gentile noodle puddings in those books, but they were savory
rather than sweet.  The other go-to book, Sara Kasden's _Love and
Knishes_ also only had a savory _lokshen kugel_.  So I turned to the
Interweb.  

That recipe I mentioned above was the second or third I found.  The
first asked me to separate the eggs and whip the whites.  But it
lacked raisins and cinnamon.  And it had crushed corn flakes on
top.  Bleh.  I ended up improvising a bit.  I did whip the egg
whites and fold them into the mixture, but I did not use corn flakes.
And I certainly used raisins and cinnamon.  

I did not record my improvised recipe.  But that's okay.  It didn't turn
out like I remember mom's kugel.  It tasted about right.  But the
consistency was wrong.  Mine was soft and loose.  I recall mom's 
(grandma Sarah's) being much firmer, more like lasagna.  

When my arteries have recovered from this attempt, maybe I'll try
again.  But I do feel happy to have made it.  It brings back memories
of childhood and the kitchen on Billings Park.

Next up, _kasha varnishkes_, if I can find a place to get buckwheat
groats.  Or maybe I'll just make potato latkes; they're less healthy,
but all the oil probably makes them a bit more comforting.

[1] Grandmother's?

[2] Or any kugel.

[3] I was going to write, "Since I went away to college", but Michelle
recalls having it, so that would have been wrong.

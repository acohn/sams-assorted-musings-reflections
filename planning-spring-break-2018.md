Planning for spring break 2018
==============================

Grinnell's amazing two-week-long spring break [1] is nearly upon us.
And folks are naturally asking me (and other people), "So, what are your
plans for spring break?"  My quick answer is "During the first week,
I'll grade.  During the second week, which is also the high school
spring break, I'll spend time with family."  But I'll clearly do more
than grade and spend time with family.

Normally, I prepare for spring break by attending one of Karla Erickson's
awesome seminars on career planning.  Unfortunately, this week it conflicted
with my normal teaching times.  Since I can't make Karla's meeting, I'm doing
a simplified version on my own.  What comes first?  Oh, right, three deep
breaths followed by thirty seconds of sitting quietly.  One.  Two.  Three.
Okay.

Next, we generally think about groups of things we have to do, putting
them in different kinds of "buckets".

Let's see ... I'll make a "bucket" for the things I'm looking forward
to during spring break.

* The high school jazz band has a concert this Saturday.  I'm excited
  to attend that.
* I *think* I can make it to one of the stops on the Grinnell Singers
  tour.  I'm also excited to attend that.
* Solo and small group ensemble day is coming up in a week.  Youngest
  son has six or so performances.  Those will be fun to see.
* We have a dinner at Relish at the end of break and Eldest Son will be
  coming in to attend.  I expect we'll have time for other things,
  too.  Perhaps even a game or two.
* I have a number of activities planned with Youngest Son during the week
  he is off, and I am trying not to plan anything that interferes with
  those activities [2].

Next up are my responsibilities at home.

* My home office is in much worse shape than my work office [3].  I
  should make forward progress on that office. _[Estimate: 1 day]_
* I need to finish taxes.  We've done most of our taxes.  What's left?
  I haven't put together our list of charitable deductions or my too-long
  list of business expenses [4]. _[Estimate: 1/2 day]_
* I need to do some work on my car.  Nothing major, but it's still probably
  a half day of work. _[Estimate: 1/2 day]_
* And then there are the normal set of things that have accumulated
  during the first half of the semester. _[Estimate: unknown]_

I joked that my break is "grading and family".  But I really do have a 
reasonable amount of grading to get to.

* I need to finish grading exam 2 for CSC 151.  I was in the midst of
  grading that exam when [my primary laptop died](i-hate-computers-2018-03-11).
  I'm not exactly sure where I am, but I need to finish. _[2 days]_
* I'm behind on a lot of the grading paperwork in CSC 151.  I need to get
  to that. _[1/2 day]_
* I'm behind on a lot of the grading paperwork (and some of the grading)
  in CSC 321.  Since that course is over, I should get preliminary grades
  to students. _[1/2 day]_
* I'm behind on a lot of the grading paperwork (and some of the grading)
  in CSC 322.  There's also a new assignment coming in just before break.
  I should get that done. _[1/2 day]_

Are there other teaching responsibilities?  Almost certainly.  Let me
see.

* I need to write the next exam for CSC 151, since we're distributing
  it right after break.  Writing the exam will also involve some
  email back-and-forth with the teacher. _[1/2 day]_
* The design of the Jekyll-based course Webs is starting to be a bit of
  an obstacle.  The biggest problem is that the data are stored in
  individual files, rather than a centralized location.  I hear from
  a colleague that they've found a natural way to deal with the issue.
  I'm going to explore how to incorporate their ideas in my course webs.
  _[1/2 day]_
* Here's an optional thing: I hear reports from students that they
  already miss the old version of CSC 151, which focused on algorithms
  for image making.  We switched to the new version for a few reasons,
  one of which was ensuring that the course was accessible to students
  who had vision impairments.  We also thought the new version would be
  equally exciting.  And I think it is, for some students [4].  But our
  long-term goal is multiple versions.  One thing I've learned from the
  new version is that we're much better off without strange libraries I
  write in C to get DrRacket to communicate to Gimp.  So if we go "back"
  to the old version, we need to do so with something closer to DrRacket's
  built-in image libraries.  I'd like to spend a few hours playing
  with that idea.  I may even play with ideas of sound in the course.
  This "responsibility" is more fun than work, but it is work-related.
  _[1/2 day]_

I've let a lot of departmental paperwork pile up.  Spring break is a
good time to catch up on paperwork.

* I am responsible for part of our department self study.  I'm not
  not responsible for analyzing data, since we don't have those yet.  But 
  I am responsible for writing department history and a description of
  the department [5].  I've also written a [general description of
  the College](about-grinnell-external-reviewers) for the report.
  _[1/2 day, if things go well]_
* The department recently joined the NCWIT [6] Academic Alliance and I
  serve as designated department representative.  I believe that means
  that I have some tasks to do.  I'll need to figure those out and
  get them done. _[1/2 day]_
* I think the department should become Access Computing partners, since
  we value issues of accessibility for diverse students.  But I never
  find the time to write the application materials.  If I don't have
  it on my list for spring break, I'll never get it done [7]. _[1/2 day]_

Is that really it?  It feels like there should be more. Wait!  I'm not
chair!  That's why my workload seems lighter.  Poor Jerod.  He also has
to write a position proposal and more stuff.  I guess that's one more
task.

* Review other departmental materials. _[1/2 day]_

Speaking of paperwork, I almost certainly have institutional paperwork
to get done.

* I had a report on the code camps due in early January.  I should
  write that report.  I also need to run some ideas from the report
  by my collaborator. _[1/2 day]_
* I expect that I owe a report on my trip to SIGCSE to my funders.
  _[1/4 day]_
* Enough things have happened recently that I should also update my
  CV.  That's not really a piece of institutional paperwork, but it's 
  still paperwork. _[1/4 day]_

I have professional responsibilities beyond the institution.

* GHC scholarship reviews. _[Between 1/2 day and 1 day]_
* A new policy for SIGCSE student volunteers. _[1/2 day, if I include
  the expected discussion]_
* Consider options for the future of the SIGCSE Student Volunteer
  Management System.  _[1/2 day, if I include the expected discussion.
  At least this will be potential musing.]_
* Clean out old accounts from the SIGCSE-members mailing list. 
  _[1/2 day]_
* Work on the new SIGCAS Web site. _[1 day]_
* Figure out what I should be doing for COPE. _[1/4 day]_
* Write a sample case study based on the Berkeley courses. _[1/2 day]_

Particularly given that my primary laptop is misbehaving, I have a 
variety of work to do just getting my digital life in order.  I don't
really expect to get most of it done, but I'm listing it here anyway.

* Either (a) attempt to get my primary laptop booting correctly with 
  some regularity or (b) gather enough failure data that I can get it
  repaired. _[1/2 day]_
* Design a more sensible way of synchronizing my primary laptop and my
  backup laptop.  I expect that I'll end up with a hybrid of Cloud 
  Storage (for the less confidential things) and `scp` with an external
  disk (for the more confidential things and the larger things). _[An
  optimistic 1/2 day]_
* Design a strategy for backing up my backups.  I've had too many backup
  disks die, so I should probably be cloning them. _[A 1/2 day that
  will probably keep until summer]_

Putting it all together, I have the following to do during spring break.

* Time primarily with family: At least eight days.
* Home responsibilities: Two days.
* Grading: Three-and-a-half days.
* Other teaching: One-half of a day of required work.  One day of optional/fun
  work.
* Department paperwork: One-and-a-half days.
* Institutional paperwork: One day.
* Other professional responsibilities: About four days.
* Dealing with my digital life: One-half of a day of required work.  One day
  of optional/useful work.

That appears to be at least twenty-one days of planned stuff plus two
more days of optional, fun, or useful work.  Since I only have sixteen
days of spring break, it's not going to all get done.  I guess I'll
just need to prioritize [8].  What will I prioritize, other than family?
It will depend on my mood.  I should also acknowledge that if I muse
daily for two weeks, that's another two days of work [9].

I'll report back in three weeks or so on what I actually got done and
how much time each task I completed really took [10].  We'll probably
also discover that I forgot a moderate number of necessary tasks.
I look forward to comparing plans to reality.

And, believe it or not, but it's helpful to realize that I can't succeed
in doing all of the work I should do.  I just have to make sure that my
reaction isn't "If I can't do everything, I'll just do nothing."

---

[1] Two weeks may seem like a long time to you.  And it is.  But I've
heard from at least one colleague that they really need a three-week-long
spring break.

[2] Whoops!  I need to make some plans for those.

[3] It helps that I have an assistant that works on my work office with
me once per week.

[4] In fact, I just had one email me and say "The data science focus sounds
really interesting.  What are my chances of getting in to the course this
fall"

[5] I need to figure out what is meant by "description of the department".

[6] National Center for Women in Information Technology, or something
like that.

[7] I probably won't get it done during spring break, either.  Nonetheless,
if it's not on my list, it certainly won't get done.

[8] Alternately, I can work longer days.  Twelve-hour days permit
one-and-a-half days of work, right?  Of course, that means it won't be
much of a break.

[9] An average musing takes me about an hour to write.  Over the sixteen
days of break, I will write for sixteen hours, or two eight-hour days.

[10] Since I'm logging my life, I can also look at broad patterns of how
I'm spending time during the sixteen days of break.  That may mean that
I'll need to start logging some things that I don't normally log, such as
family time.

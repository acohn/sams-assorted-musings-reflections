Should it go to waste or to waist?
==================================

Last week, while I was serving as Student-Volunteer Coordinator at
the SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, we
ended up gathering a bunch of food in the room.  People brought the
snacks left from a break.  A Symposium Chair brought leftover deserts
from the Conference Committee Dinner.  I probably brought a few
things to.  Students ate a lot of the food, but certainly not all
of it.

So at the end of the conference, we were left with food.  In a more
optimal world, someone would have arranged for a way to get that
food to people who needed empty calories [1], just as had happened
with the leftovers from the awesome SIGCSE-sponsored, GitHub-funded
Student-Volunteer dinner at Nando's [2].

But that did not happen.  I'm not even sure how we could make that
happen.  Many cities have very strict rules on what kinds of leftovers
can and cannot go to the needy.

So, while cleaning out the room, I grabbed a box of brownies so that
they wouldn't go to waste.  But when I got back to my room, I realized 
that if I ate them, they would just go to waist [3].  That also seemed
like a bad idea.  So I guess they go to waste after all.

Oh well.  I at least I found good homes for any leftover student 
swag [4].

[1] By the time we were leaving, it was basically just leftover desserts.
I think "leftover deserts" qualify as empty calories.

[2] We let the students take to-go boxes.  We encouraged them to take
more.  There was still a lot left.  Then Nando's said "Don't worry, we
have a deal with Catholic Charities."

[3] More specifically, to my waist.

[4] Some of which went home to Grinnell students.

Mourn what you've lost or celebrate what you had
================================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

The other day, while I was driving to work, an advertisement came on NPR
for some product whose name I forget. basically, it's a subscription
service in which each month your child receives a box with a bunch of
items from some other country.  I thought to myself "That's something mom
would have ordered."  And I remembered the small blue science kits that
used to arrive each month.  Then I thought about the fact that while I
kept them for years and years, I'm pretty sure that they got thrown out
when mom moved to Grinnell.  That made me sad.  It also makes me sad to
think about our house; I'll never see it again, or at least won't see
it again in the same context [1].

Then I realized that it's wrong to mourn these losses.  I am so incredibly
fortunate to have a family that encouraged me with things like the science
kits, to have had the resources we had, WRITE MOURN  So I shouldn't be
mourn the loss of things that made me happy.  Rather, I should celebrate
that I had those things in the first place.  I should think about the
fun of learning from the kits [2] and about all the things I loved about
our house.  That should make me happy.

But why can't I stop crying?

[1] That doesn't stop me from dreaming about it.  I have way too many
dreams in which we're back in that house with mom.

[2] I'll admit that I don't remember what I learned.  But I still remember
opening boxes and seeing a shell or a rock or someting with an associated
explanation.

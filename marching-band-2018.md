Marching band
=============

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc)*

Yesterday was the last performance of the 2018 GHS marching band show,
_Peace, Love, and Rock and Roll_, which I wish they had named _Sax,
Drums, and Rock and Roll_. It was also the last time Michelle and I
will attend a marching band performance as parents of a band member [1].
Ten years have gone by comparatively quickly.  And it's been interesting
to see how our perspectives and the bands have changed over the years.

While I enjoy watching the GHS band play, I particularly enjoy marching
band competitions, where I can see and hear other bands.  While I
appreciate the performances, I also like seeing what other schools
do and how they approach the concept.  While I don't think I've ever
seen keyboards, electric guitar, or electric bass at a GHS show, they
seem to be a fairly common approach.  Some schools use big, portable,
screens at the back of the field which may provide a starting location
for band members, a place for the color guard to store flags or to change,
or a backdrop.

Some schools go over the top in their accessories.  For one band's
performance of "Singing in the Rain", they'd purchased [2] park benches
and street lamps that they carried and wheeled out onto the field.
Some use smoke generators as part of their performance.  I care more about
the music, the synchronization of the performers, and the storytelling
of the color guard.

A few things stand out from this year's marching band season [3].
I saw one of my first performances with a synthesizer with some
prerecorded sounds.  Michelle and I noted many more male performers in
the color guards.  And, for the first time ever, I saw a theremin used
in a marching band performance [4,5].  I also hope that the GHS band's
Latin-tinged [6] "White Rabbit" sticks with me.

As much as I enjoy marching band, I'm not sure if I'll end up going to
competitions in the future.  It's always a bit of a drive (a little over
an hour for the first competition, about fifty minutes for the second).
Without a child in band, I may not hear them announced.  And, well,
my time is always limited.  In addition, sitting out in the cold in a
damp football stadium is not particularly pleasant.

Nontheless, it's been a fun ten years.

[1] We will attend other band performances throughout the year including,
we hope, their spring 2019 Disney show..

[2] Or rented.

[3] "Season" is an overstatement.  There were only two competitions.

[4] In _The Witch and the Saint_.  My quick Web search did not suggest
whether or not it's a standard instrument for that piece.  I couldn't find
another performance that included one.  I did, however, find [a fairly
theatrical performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHH7A13f-oQ)
that includes a giant cauldron and a performer's eye view.

[5] That may also have been my first experience seeing the theremin used
in *any* live performance.

[6] Is that the right term?  It will have to suffice.

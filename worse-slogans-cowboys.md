Even worse collegiate marketing slogans
=======================================

Over the years, I've complained fairly regularly about some of Grinnell's
marketing campaigns, from the legendary "No Limits" to the current
ungrammatical phrases and twoish-word flags.  But none of what we've done
comes close to the stupidity of the new University of Wyoming campaign,
which is *The World Needs More Cowboys*.  You can read a bit about it in
[_Chronicle_](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Flagship-s-Proposed-Slogan/243883) or [_Inside Higher Ed_](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/07/09/wyomings-cowboy-slogan-draws-criticism).

Not very inclusive.  What do you think of when you think of a cowboy?

Here's an interesting comment from the _Chronicle_ article.

> Baldwin said the results of a market-research survey conducted by a third-party firm show that the campaign is, in fact, effective in dispelling the stereotype of a cowboy and in enticing prospective students to apply. The survey, of prospective college students nationwide, found that a majority of respondents said the promotional video had changed their perception of what it meant to be a cowboy, and had made it more likely that theyâ€™d apply to the university [1].

(Videos try to make it more so; do they really expect
that people will watch the videos?)  Mel Brooks.  

Do they not realize that "cowboy" also has other meanings?
When you call someone a "cowboy", you mean someone who
ignores rules for their own pleasure or benefit.  What does
[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cowboy) say?

> (informal) A person who engages in reckless behavior, especially for the purpose of showing off.

Yeah, the world definitely needs more of those people [2].  

Of course, it's not just Wiktionary that refers to them this way.  [Urban
dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cowboy) adds

> Wild, impulsive, living on the edge and taking risks without worrying about the consequences. 

Even [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cowboy)
agrees, piling on the criticisms.

> one having qualities (such as recklessness, aggressiveness, or
independence) popularly associated with cowboys: such as **a** : a
reckless driver **b** : a business or businessperson operating in an
uncontrolled or unregulated manner

I will admit that every time I hear the phrase applied in this context,
I think of a white man.  I'm pretty sure that most people do, too.
We don't normally call reckless women "cowboys".  We don't normally call
reckless people of color "cowboys".

How about "The world needs *fewer* cowboys"?

fill in the obvious one.

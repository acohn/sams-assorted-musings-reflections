Even worse collegiate marketing slogans
=======================================

Over the years, I've complained fairly regularly about some of Grinnell's
marketing campaigns, from the legendary "No Limits" to the current
ungrammatical phrases and twoish-word flags.  But none of what we've
done comes close to the stupidity of the new University of Wyoming
campaign, which is *The World Needs More Cowboys*.  You may think
I'm joking, but I'm perfectly serious.  You can read a bit about it in
[_Chronicle_](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Flagship-s-Proposed-Slogan/243883)
or [_Inside Higher
Ed_](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/07/09/wyomings-cowboy-slogan-draws-criticism).

What's wrong with that phrase?  Well, what characteristics do you
associate with cowboys?  That's right ... "white" and "male".  So, at
face value, the term does not feel very inclusive.   If you're a woman,
or reject the gender binary, or are a person of color, or you were born
in America, I would expect that the marketing slogan would suggest that
UWyoming wants people other than you.  And if you're a Native American,
you might feel like UWyoming wants more people to commit genocide.

As you might expect, a wide variety of folks [1] at UWyoming raised these
kinds of concerns.  But the marketing folks feel differently.  The goal
of the campaign appears to be to undermine the traditional concept of
"cowboy" and to make it a more inclusive term.  For example, here's a
comment from the _Chronicle_ article.

> Baldwin said the results of a market-research survey conducted by
a third-party firm show that the campaign is, in fact, effective in
dispelling the stereotype of a cowboy and in enticing prospective students
to apply. The survey, of prospective college students nationwide, found
that a majority of respondents said the promotional video had changed
their perception of what it meant to be a cowboy, and had made it more
likely that they'd apply to the university [2].

I'm a bit stunned that people would take this seriously.  After all, how
many people who are not paid or otherwise incentivized to watch a
promotional video for an institution actually watch it.  Certainly, when
I look at my kids, videos are among the things they are least likely
to check out.  A cool marketing package?  Maybe.  An informative Web
site that they can explore?  Maybe.  An online video?  Probably not.

However, it appears that administrators everywhere lack a clue.
In spite of the concerns people have raised, UWyoming has decided to
trust their marketing consultants and to go ahead with the slogan.

Do they not realize that "cowboy" also has other, less positive, meanings?
When you call someone a "cowboy" today, you often mean someone who ignores
rules for their own pleasure or benefit.  It's easy to find that out.
[Urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cowboy)
describes cowboys as follows.

> Wild, impulsive, living on the edge and taking risks without worrying
about the consequences.

They are not alone.  [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cowboy)
describes cowboys as follows.

> (informal) A person who engages in reckless behavior, especially for
the purpose of showing off.

Yeah, the world definitely needs more of those people [3].  

Of course, you may not trust these newfangled,
crowd-sourced reference materials [4].  So you might turn to
[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cowboy).
But they have a similar definition and even add some examples to the mix.

> one having qualities (such as recklessness, aggressiveness, or
independence) popularly associated with cowboys: such as **a** : a
reckless driver **b** : a business or businessperson operating in an
uncontrolled or unregulated manner

Yeah, the world definitely needs more reckless drivers and unethical
business people.

That model of "cowboy" is also fairly exclusive.  I will admit that
every time I hear the term "cowboy" applied in this way, I think of a
white man.  I'm pretty sure that most people do, too.  We don't normally
call reckless women "cowboys".  We don't normally call reckless people
of color "cowboys".  I guess we can make the term more inclusive, but
it's not a positive term.

How about "The world needs *fewer* cowboys"?

Maybe I'll stop complaining about our marketing campaign.  It's not nearly
that bad.

Sometimes I wonder if there's a big conspiracy among marketing folks to
see what they can convince their clients to do.  "We have a client whose
mission is to help students understand how to be responsible citizens.
We convinced them that _No Limits_ made sense."  "We convinced our client
to name their team after a group of people and to use an insensitive
caricature of those people as their logo."  "We convinced our client
to use a display font in 6pt for the text in their everyday letters."
"We convinced our client that _The World Needs More Cowboys_ is an
inclusive phrase."  "You win."

fill in the obvious one.

[4] You may also doubt the tendency of linguists to say that at least
in American English, we should be descriptive rather than prescriptive.

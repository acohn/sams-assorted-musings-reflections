The Rebelsky Family Reading Group met twice during winter break.
For those who are not long-term readers or for those who don't
immediately remember all the details of my life expressed in these
musings, the Rebelsky Family Reading Group is a practice our family
adopted a few years ago when I suggested that everyone read
Carol Dweck's _Mindset_.  As is the case in most reading groups,
we pick a book, read it [1], and then discuss it.  We try to order
pizza for the meeting.

We rotate who chooses the book.  I pick, then Michelle, then Eldest,
then Middle, then Youngest, and then back to me again.

It became harder to have reading group meetings as the kids scattered
across the country, but we've managed.  For example, I recall one
meeting in Eldest Son's living room in Cleveland.  We planned a meeting
for this winter break, and Youngest had chosen the book.  Youngest
chose _Catch 22_, but we all found that were behind on reading.  So
he switched to _The Hitchhikers Guide to the Gallery_, which we all
managed to read in one day [2].

I'd been looking ahead to this time and made plans for my choices.
I chose two picture books [3].  At first, my family rejected this
idea.  But then they, too, realized the potential joys of doing a
second session of RFRG, and they acquiesced [4].

So, what did I chose?  I started with Maurice Sendak's _Higglety
Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More To Life_.  Why that book?  I
recalled it fondly as a favorite from childhood.  I love Sendak in
general, and that one seemed less popular than most, certainly
less so than _Pierre_ or _One Was Johnny_ or perhaps any of
_The Nutshell Library_, less popular than _Where The Wild Things
Are_ or _In The Night Kitchen_ [5].

But one picture book didn't seem like enough, so as I second I
picked David Macaulay's _Baaa_.  Why that book?  It's a book from
my young adulthood [6].  Macaulay's black-and-white artwork bears
some distant relationship to Sendak's.  I appreciate that someone
who writes regularly about the wonders of technology would write
such a dystopian tale.  Plus, Soylent Green!  And there's the summary
in the Library-of-Congress description,

> After the last person has gone from the earth, sheep take over the
world, make the same mistakes as man, and eventually they too 
disappear.

What was it like reading the books fifty and thirty-five years
since I first read them?  I still like the pictures.  I still like
the stories.  They also resonate in different ways than they did
when I first encountered them.  While I don't expect our government
to react to riots in the same way as in _Baaa_, I have been surprised
by how far one part will go to get its way.  And, as someone said,
_Higglety Pigglety Pop_ seems to be how a greedy, overprivileged,
narcissist goes out into the world, abuses those around them, and
achieves even more success.  Wow, that seems familiar, doesn't it?

I prefer a different reading.  In the end, _Higglety Pigglety Pop_
is about forsaking comfort for exploration, detaching yourself from
your possessions, and becoming willing to sacrifice yourself for
another.  I'm not sure I've learned those lessons well enough, but
I take them as goals worth pursuing.

In retrospect, I'm not sure that picture books were the best choice.
While we were able to read them quickly and I enjoyed reading them
again [7], we didn't seem to get into the depth of discussion that
we often reach.  

What's next?  Michelle will choose.  Then Eldest.  Then Middle.
Then Youngest.  By then, I should have a new choice ready.  Probably
something a bit longer.  Possibly something with fewer pictures.

[1] Well, most of us read it.  I seem to always read too slowly.

[2] A Thursday, to be precise.  That has some meaning relative to the
book.

[3] You might call them "graphic novellas" or some such.  I'm calling
them picture books.

[4] Perhaps they were worried about what else I might choose.  I
suggested Umberto Eco's _The Name of the Rose_, Harold Bloom's _The
Western Canon_, and a collection by Borges [5].  I was also considering
R. F. Kuang's _The Poppy War_ and Greil Marcus' _The History of Rock
'n' Roll in Ten Songs_.  Come to think of it, I hadn't thought about
rock books.  Maybe next time I'll choose _Stranded_.

[5] Is _In The Night Kitchen_ banned?  Should it be?

[6] It came out while I was in college.

[7] And looking at the pictures.

Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Jen Jacobsen '95
==============================================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnellians](index-grinnellians)*

*Note: I started this musing early this semester, spurred by some helpful
comments Jen had posted on some of my musings and by a forthcoming
Faculty Friday talk she was giving.  This past Friday, the campus
learned that [Jen is moving on to a new position](https://www.thesandb.com/article/jennifer-jacobsen-to-leave-grinnell.html).  That makes some things
I planned to write irrelevant, at best [1].  Nonetheless, I consider it
worthwhile to report a bit on this wonderful Grinnellian.*

Jennifer "Jen" Jacobsen '95 is Grinnell's _Wellness Czar_ [2,3].  I
assume that most students and faculty on campus know Jen because
of her many activities.  What activities?  I'm not sure that I could
enumerate them all.  I'm not sure anyone could, other than Jen [4].
Here are just a few. She developed and runs our bystander intervention
training.  She developed and runs our Student-Athlete Mentor [5]
program.  She does careful studies of student wellness issues and
works hard to correct misconceptions, particularly misconceptions
that lead to less healthy behavior [6].  She conducts workshops for
staff and faculty to help them better understand our students and
to reflect on ways to better support our students.  She teaches a
variety of courses that help broaden student perspectives, on topics
that include cooking, life after Grinnell, and relationships [8].
She explores ways to break down barriers between our varsity athletes
and our other students [9,10].  And, as I said, that just scratches
the surface.

There are so many things I appreciate about Czar Jacobsen.  She
clearly thinks deeply about a wide variety of issues; not just
student wellness, but broader campus policies and issues.  She
expresses that thoughtfulness in a variety of ways, from formal
programs to informal advice.  She's willing to challenge things.
I particularly appreciate that she's willing to challenge *me*; I
can count on a challenge from Jen for at least one musing per week.
She's willing to take risks to move things forward.  I know of few
people who have made such a positive impact on the student experience
at Grinnell.

I appreciate our many interactions, which have ranged from informal
conversations and Facebook posts to week-long workshops on supporting
students.  I particularly appreciate that she's always willing to
talk to me about student issues that come up.  Among other things,
we've discussed how I might talk to students about alcohol, drugs,
and sex; how I can better support students during times of stress;
how, as an institution, we can better understand the experiences
of students, particularly our varsity athletes; and the availability
of protein and Sunday morning meals in the cafeteria.

Jen also has an interesting history at the College.  As a student,
she made significant contributions to Al Jones' _Pioneering_.  She
was also active as a varsity athlete.  I'm sure there's more, but
I haven't had enough opportunities to talk to her about it.

There's much more I could write.  There's probably more that I should
write.  But I'm reluctant to go deeply into any particular stories.
Take the time to get to know her, and you'll find the investment well
worth your time.

_When Jen's departure was announced, someone said "I hope that we can
quickly find a replacement."  I'm not sure we can replace her; few people
can bring three core characteristics to the position: a deep and broad
understanding of wellness informed by the literature, an understanding
of and ability to make deep connections with Grinnell students [11], and
a willingness to challenge authority [12].  I think, for example, of
the ways Jen worked with students who hosted off-campus parties to get
them to think more deeply about monitoring and supporting their peers;
too often, it seems like Grinnell's approach is more dictatorial and
less inclusive [14].  I know that "a close relationship with a faculty
or staff member" has been shown to be one of the most significant factors
in student persistence; I expect that more students have such a close
relationship with Jen than with any other faculty or staff member._

_Still, she has set a number of important programs in place and changed
the way many people on campus think.  So we'll get by.  And I'll try
to be hopeful that her successor will bring the knowledge, generosity
of spirit, creativity, willingness to challenge, and good will that Jen
does._

Postscript: As I was reflecting back on this musing and on my 
interactions with Jen, I realized that I missed one really important
thing: Jen was instrumental during the time about seven years ago
when I most successfully worked on my weight and wellness.  I'm trying 
to get back to that state, but it's much harder seven years later.
In any case, I appreciate all that Jen did to help at that time.
Thanks Jen!

[1] For example, the notes I wrote earlier this semester include
the observation that "Jen does enough teaching of our students that
should get the title of Lecturer."

[2] That Jen's title for herself, at least on Facebook.  It suffices.

[3] Jen tells me that Tim Hammond initially assigned the title to her.

[4] Well, there are probably a few other people.

[5] I don't think she named it after me, but I still appreciate the
acronym.

[6] A surprising number of our students think that their peers drink
and cohabit significantly more than their peers actually drink and
cohabit.  Helping students learn what really happens not only makes
it less likely that students consider extreme behaviors "normal", it
also normalizes more reasonable behaviors [7].

[7] Jen would have phrased that much better.

[8] My notes on this said "stupidity of them being listed as PE
100, which means that no one can see the description".  My broader
comment was that these are important courses that students always
tell me they appreciate having taken.  But too few students know about
them because they get hidden in PE 100.  I'd prefer to see them listed
as regular classes, with an accompanying description.  But if they are
regular classes, they can only be taught by regular faculty.  Hence
my earlier comment that Jen should have the title of Lecturer.

[9] She also helps folks think about language.  When we first started
talking about the barriers and connections, she was careful to
explain why she didn't just use the term "athlete", since many
of our students who are not part of sports teams are still athletes.

[10] I expect that experiences are very different at Grinnell than
at other schools.  Many varsity athletes, particularly in the "big
three" men's teams, are sometimes reluctant to reveal that part of
their identity because there are people on campus who associate
participation in those teams with negative characteristics.  More
broadly, though, many varsity athletes feel ostracized, and many
other students feel like the varsity athletes separate themselves.

[11] I recently had a student tell me that they learned more from Jen
in their first two years at Grinnell than they learned from anyone
else at the College.

[12] Iowa is a "right to work" state, which basically means that an
employer can fire you at any time for any reason.  That makes some
people unwilling to speak out.

[14] Yes, I do plan to muse about the new dorm evacuation policies.

Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Jen Jacobsen '96
==============================================================

So many things I appreciate.  Thoughtful and expresses that thoughtfulness 
in so many different ways.  Willing to challenge things.  Willing to
challenge me.  (I can count on a challenge from Jen for at least one
music per week.  And, even though she keeps expanding my ways of thinking,
I seem to still remain too narrow in my thinking too much of the time.)
Devoted to student wellness.  Well connected - whenever I mention some
place.  Tries new things to help broaden student perspectives; life after
Grinnell, cooking class, new relationships class [stupidity of them being
listed as PE 100, which means that no one sees the description].  Jen
does enough teaching of our students that should get the title of lecturer.

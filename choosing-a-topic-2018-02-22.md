Choosing a topic
================

_Sam, how do you choose what topic to muse about?_ [1]

That's a reasonable question [3].  On some days, I find that I've been
thinking about a topic enough during the day that it becomes natural
to write about it at night.  More generally, I trust my muse.
Sometimes my muse says "It's time to muse about *this*."  Sometimes
my muse and I review [the list of potential topics we've come up
with](too-much-to-write-2018-01-250) and the muse picks one for me.

Believe it or not, but there are times my muse is wrong [5] and I get
partway through a musing before I realize that it's not the right topic
for the day.  I set those aside, update the list of potential topics,
and ask my muse to consider another.

Then there are the days that I'm really lazy [6].  My muse may
suggest a topic, and I'll respond "I don't have time to write that".
Or perhaps my muse and I will start out by asking, "What's something
you can write relatively quickly?"  On those days, I find a musing that
has a substantial draft [7,8].  Once in a while, I can spend only a few
minutes cleaning up the draft.  But those days are rare.  More generally,
when I clean up a draft musing, even one that is mostly complete, I get
caught up in the topic and end up revising the "draft" substantially.
For example, I may rearrange it, change language, add material, or add
connections.

Today?  I thought I had a mostly complete draft of this musing.  But I
ended up rewriting most of it.  I added some new topics [9].  I rephrased
a number of sentences [10].  I added end notes [11].  I also wondered whether
[I had written about this topic before](following-my-muse).  It appears 
that I did.  It may even be that the prior piece is different.  But,
hey, I've spent my writing time on this musing.  So that's what you get.
And, hey, at some point I can reflect back on how my comments and
style changed between the two [12].  Perhaps I'll even find a way to
synthesize a new, better, musing.  Yeah, I think it's worth posting,
if only for myself [14].

[1] Should that be "_Sam, how do you choose the topic about which to
muse?_"? [2]

[2] And how many question marks does that second question need?

[3] No, not the second or third questions [4].  The first one.  That is,
_Sam, how do you choose what topic to muse about?_

[4] They could also be reasonable questions.  Nonetheless, in today's
musing, I have chosen to respond to the original question.

[5] Or perhaps it's just that I'm not listening well enough to my muse.

[6] Or tired, or with limited time, or ...

[7] I write most musings from scratch. Nonetheless, I find that I also
have a lot of partial musings.  Some exist because of the aforementioned
habit of starting a musing and then giving.  Other exist because when
I note the topic, I also provide some context for myself.

[8] When I say "I find a musing that has a substantial draft", I really
mean "my muse guides me to select a piece that has a substantial draft".

[9] Yes, I add topics, even in a musing this short.

[10] Believe it or not, but this is not the first draft.  It may not even
be the second.

[11] Like this one.

[12] Or three, or four, or however many musings I write about the topic.

[14] I am, after all, my primary audience.

From somewhre in the previous musing: I can also explore steam and
steel; fathers and daddies; grumbling, drumbling, rumbling; whether
each of those has two or three syllables; words inserted and deleted;
dream and feel.  Things like that.

Interesting claim at https://web.archive.org/web/20061020073137/http://www.folkblues.com/goodman/cono.htm

ABC News' morning show, Good Morning America, which started in the mid-70's, took its name and its original theme from the chorus of City of New Orleans.

I think I have to have my friendly local lilbrarian help me find  Sanders, Craig. "Writing of 'City of New Orleans'". Trains 77(9):34-39.

Found it.  Only $6.99 (ended up being $10.43 because I was buying an actual physical issue).  Worth it for research.  https://trn.trains.com/issues/2017/september-2017

Also a longer biography Steve Goodman: Facing the Music http://www.clayeals.com/.  I'll leave that for another day.

1971 album!

And I was dealing cards with the old men in the club car.
And it's penny a point, there ain't one keeping score.
Won't you pass that paper bag that holds that bottle.
You can feel the wheels grumbling through the floor.

Fathers' (Guthrie, Goodman 1971) vs. Daddies' (Goodman other times)

Easter tapes has that paper bag that holds that bottle.

1974-02-02, Portland OR

I wrote this thing about three and a half years ago and I never gave it much thought.
And I taught it to a couple of friends of mine in the back of a bar in Chicago.
And the next thing I, the damn things was on the radio.
I've been sitting in that bar waiting for somebody else to come in ever since.

I was dealing cards to the old men in the club car.
It's penny a point, there ain't nobody keeping score.
Won't you pass that paper bag that holds that bottle.
You can feel the wheels grumbling beneath the floor.

Says that he wrote it in 1970 and Arlo Guthrie learned it in the back of the Quiet Knight in 1972 (?).  Hybrid lyrics.

From the XRT show.

We were on the City of New Orleans going to Southern Illinois to the Masons old people's home. Think you had to get off in Effingham or drive to it or something, get off in Mantoon and to drive it, to see Nancy's 90 some year old grandmother.

To let her see what I looked like.

Nancy fell asleep on the train ride.  And I took out a pen and I looked out the window and wrote down I saw: You know, Kankakee, Junkyards.  And you know, I dunno, I just wrote it.  It was starting to turn into something.


Kankakee junkyards right it was starting to turn into something that the cars, it just, it was there. It was visited by the Muse I don't feel like I did anything else. Took about 35 minutes.
And in the first first the last person forced me to come back to the room, latest ridiculous. And he, he said that's all well and good about looking out the window

How far am I willing to go?  Will I subscribe to Wolfgang's vault?  Do the
artists get anything from it?

Shared governance?
==================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), [Grinnell](index-grinnell)*

A few weeks ago, President Kington wrote [an
editorial](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2018/12/20/debate-about-undergraduate-student-unionization-goes-core-institutions-mission)
about the expansion of the [Union of Grinnell Student Dining
Workers](https://www.ugsdw.org/).  A sentence early on in the editorial
caught my eye.

> Regardless of whether the students choose to pursue an expansion of our college’s student union, as leaders of the college, the board and I must decide what type of college Grinnell is as our community grapples with this complex issue about which reasonable, fair-minded people can and do disagree.

I agree with President Kington that reasonable people can disagree about
the appropriate approach to UGSDW's expansion efforts.  And this musing
[1] is not about those efforts.  Rather, I find myself concerned by a
small phrase in that sentence, "the board and I must decide what type of
college Grinnell is".

While I realize that, in the end, final authority for the type of college
Grinnell is and will be rests with the Trustees.  However, it has traditionally
been the case that the president and the Trustees make decisions about 
Grinnell in consultation with the faculty, staff, students, and alumni.  I am
troubled that no such consultation is mentioned.

Whatever happened to shared governance?

Now, it may be that the complexity of that sentence did not permit a
"with consultation" in the discussion of deciding what type of college
Grinnell is.  But if shared governance were a priority, President Kington
could have found a way to rewrite the sentence.  Here's a try.

> Regardless of whether the students choose to pursue an expansion of our college’s student union, the College needs to decide on an approach.  As our community grapples with this complex issue---about which reasonable, fair-minded people can and do disagree---the Board and I, in consultation with faculty, staff, and alumni, must decide on an appropriate response [2].  

Yeah, that works.  If I can find a way to mention consultation, President
Kington could have, too.

It may be that it was a careless omission.  But I assume that his
article was carefully reviewed and edited by folks at Grinnell.  So it
seems unlikely.

More importantly, in this situation, it seems that there wasn't careful
consultation with faculty [3].  In the comments section, Sharn Obstaz
writes, "Curious if the Grinnell faculty were allowed to vote on whether
they thought expanding the student union would harm the faculty-student
relationship or whether that was wording suggested by the lawyers that
they had used in previous union-busting."  The answer is, no, the faculty
did not vote on the expansion of the UGSDW nor did we discuss it.

Now, it may be that President Kington and the Board consulted with a
smaller group of faculty, such as Executive Council.  After all, President
Kington regularly appears to treat representative governance as part of
shared governance.  But there was not broad consultation.

[1] Rant.

[2] "What type of college Grinnell is" seems overly broad for the situation
at hand.

[3] I don't know about staff and alumni.  However, enough alumni are upset
about the College's response that I must assume that they were not
consulted closely.

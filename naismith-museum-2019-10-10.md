Visiting the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame
=============================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants)*

Today, I visited the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, in Springfield,
Mass.  Although I grew up in the Boston area and I was a big Celtics
fan [1], I never managed to visit the Hall of Fame until now.  It
was surprisingly empty.  Or perhaps it's not so surprising; it's
fall, and school is in session.  I'm not sure who visits during
days like that, other than the occasional tourist.  I appreciated
some things about the museum, including lots of videos [2] and a great
exhibit about the importance of the players' union [3].  I clearly would
have had more fun if I was someone who played basketball; there's
a big gym at the center that includes a variety of old kinds of
hoops, as well as hoops of different heights so that you can dunk.

At the entrance, there was also a catalog for the [Naismith Basketball
Hall of Fame
Auction](https://goldinauctions.com/Category/Naismith_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame_Auction-236.html).
I picked up a catalog because I thought it would make a fun souvenir.
I read through it while waiting for the introductory video to start.
There's not much I would want [4,5].  I found some of it amusing, including
the sheer volume of memorabilia associated with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and
the customized Hummer that LeBron James received for his 18th birthday.

But I also found it frustrating.  I'm not sure who is selling this
stuff, but some of it really belongs in the Hall of Fame.  There
are lots of jerseys out there, so it seems fine to auction those
off.  But Abdul-Jabbar's NCAA Championship Trophy?  It should be
in the museum, not in some collector's hands.  James Naismith's
personal scrapbook?  The museum is named after him; shouldn't the
scrapbook be there?  What is going on that these are being sold?
And what's going on that they are being sold with the museum's name
associated with the sale?

The other thing that bothered me was the Zion Williamson memorabilia
listed at the end of the catalog.  As a high-school or college player,
Williamson would not be allowed to make money from his uniform or
shoes.  But it seems that someone is.  I'm not sure that California's
solution is the right one [6], but something needs to be done.

I'm glad I visited the museum.  It reminded me of some of the reasons
I used to watch basketball and re-emphasized the ways in which it
combines teamwork with individual performances.  But I wish I had not
picked up the catalog.

Postscript: It's a bit more than a week before the end of the
auction.  Right now, the five highest bids are for a Michael Jordan
photo-matched used & signed jersey ($76,000), the 1969 Lew Alcindor
UCLA Bruins NCAA Championship Ring ($55,000), a LeBron James
high-school jersey that is photo-matched to his first _Sports
Illustrated_ cover ($50,000), a lithograph of the NBA's 50 greatest
players signed by all (or almost all) 50 players ($48,000), and
Abdul-Jabbar's 1969 Naismith College Player of the Year trophy [7]
($43,000).  In contrast, the Naismith scrapbook is only at $5,000.

Postscript: Today is 10-10.  I suppose I should have considered
writing something about the Grinnell tradition.  However, nothing
in particular came to mind, so I'll leave it until another 10-10.

[1] I followed the Celtics in the late 1970s, after their last
championship and before the Bird era.  It may have been the worst
time to be a Celtics fan.  But I really liked the team.

[2] I saw some great shots of Bill Russell's blocks as well as the
legendary "Havlicek stole the ball!"

[3] I had not realized that the players had threatened to boycott
the 1964 All-Star game unless (reasonable) demands were met.  And
I'd forgotten [how free agency had started in the
NBA](https://www.oscarrobertson.com/oscar-robertson-rule).

[4] Or could afford.

[5] There's a lithograph of five Boston Celtics signed by Red
Auerbach, John Havlicek, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tom Heinsohn
that I found cool.  A part of me also really likes the various
signed items related to the 1992 Dream Team.  But I don't need any
of that stuff.

[6] For those who haven't been paying attention, the California 
legislature approved legislation that allows college athletes to
profit off of their name or image.  While that sounds like a good
idea at first glance, it is likely to create some significant problems,
such as boosters offering to pay recruits a lot to use their image.

[7] The trophy was awarded to Lew Alcindor, but you know what I mean.

As many people know by now, I find myself incredibly frustrated by
Grinnell's credit-hour definition.  At present, that definition
suggests that a four-credit class should require 180 hours of work
across the semester, or about twelve hours of work per week (in-class
and out-of-class).  That gives our students a curricular workload
of forty-eight hours, which I find high when I combine it with their
co-curriculars, their extra-curriculars, their gainful employment,
their athletics, and their time to build connections and community.

We didn't always have this definition.  In fact, it's relatively
recent, from the past five years or so [1].  Before that, we that
a four-credit class typically met for three or four fifty-minute
blocks or two 110-minute blocks and, presumably, had two or three
hours of assigned work per hour in class.  But then someone got
worried about what the folks at HLC would think.  After all, in the
traditional model, a four-credit course meets for four hours per
week, or, at minimum, the equivalent of four fifty-minute blocks
per week.  Rather than take a stand that the amount Grinnell students
learn in one of our classes is clearly more than the amount in most
four-credit courses across the nation, we went with a standard
definition.  I guess I can understand; we already have to spend
significant effort to argue that Grinnell's individually advised
curriculum achieves its goals. Why add a second difficult argument?

Beyond my concerns about the forty-eight-hour academic workload, I
bristle at the lack of clarity associated with the bean counting.
Amazingly enough, students differ.  Some read more rapidly than
others.  Some compose quickly; others struggle to wrangle grammar
into place.  Some intuit that right approach for a mathematical or
programming problem.  Others must try and discard multiple other
approaches.  In CS, I've seen ratios of eight or more for the time
that different highly competent students take on an assignment.

Then there's the issue of the work required for a particular grade.
I've had students tell me that "I can do B+-level work on this
assignment in two hours.  Doing A-level work would require another
six hours.  It's not worth the extra work; I won't learn much more."
And they are probably right.  I've been spending the semester as a
student in _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_.  When writing
manuscripts for that course, I could spew at my normal musing rate
(less than thirty minutes per page) or carefully craft my text
(usually closer to two hours per page). I could write one draft or
revise ruthlessly.  When editing my peer's manuscripts, I could
make a few notes on each page and write a short conclusion at the
end or I could strive for much deeper comments and even look for
references to support some suggestions [2].  Oh, wait!  We don't
get graded on those edits.  So much time wasted.  When reading a
piece for the class, I could skim and get a high-level overview, or
read repeatedly, pen in hand, notebook at my side to record.
Particularly since I'm not getting a grade in the class, it shouldn't
matter.

Returning to that earlier issue, I also see that our skill at writing
differs significantly.  Some students seem to be able to turn phrases
at will, to draw out a lyrical phrase or compelling rhythm with
little effort, or at least much less effort than I spend.  I read
sentences that I suppose I could presumably write, but it would
likely take an hour on each to hone it to the beautiful perfection
my peers achieve.

So I find myself asking, "180 hours of work *by whom?* and *for
what grade?*"  Should I be assessing the time required for my student
who takes the least time, my average student, my median student,
my student who takes the most time? Or should I not base it on
Grinnell students at all? After all, we accept transfer credit from
institutions that I know require significantly less work in a
four-credit course than I request.  Perhaps I should consider some
mythical average American college student, who scored about 21 on
the ACT [3].

Maybe it's my discipline.  The field of CS has still not reached
agreement on what belongs in each course and what level of understanding
is necessary, particularly at the introductory level.  We teach
recursion in our first course.  Many institutions do not.  We require
students to implement the data structures they learn in our "CS2"
course.  Many institutions do not.  Some institutions require
students to implement `malloc` in their first year.  We do not.

But I don't think it's just CS.  I know that Grinnell's Calc II
includes material that many (most?) institutions leave until Calc
III.  I've heard that our introductory Latin sequence covers more
in one year than even peer institutions spread out over two years.
I don't even know how you compare the innovative Bio 150 to other
introductory courses.

It frustrates me that I feel like we are paying more attention to
these expectations than others.  I've talked to colleagues at schools
on our comparison list who give much less homework than we do, at
least in Mathematics and CS.  Why are we holding ourselves to a
more extreme standard than many others?

As we deal with emergency remote learning and the broader effects
of the pandemic, I find myself regularly returning to the 180-hour
question. We're told to adjust our expectations, and I agree that
it's appropriate to do so.  But we're also told to maintain the
180-hour expectation. How do I do that while also paying attention
to my students' mental states, their potential need to increase
their work hours because they have a family member out of work?
Can I readily assume that work will now take students longer, and
give less?  Can I change the model of "for whom?" to "whoever it
was before, but now facing extreme challenges"? In my case, these
are all hypothetical questions; I am on sabbatical this
semester. They are, nonetheless, important questions.

Because I'm annoying and have the time to be annoying, I've been
trying to ask these questions at the meetings I attend.  No one has
been willing to say "Yes, you can cut back on the 180 hours";
presumably, they worry that HLC will view the recordings of our
conversations that Cisco stores in the Webex vaults.  I've even
tried to switch tactics and get a definition of "180 hours" that
ends up being more of an upper bound, rather than whatever it
currently is.  No success.  I wonder if anyone even reads my comments
any more.

With hopes of getting a sense as to how Grinnell's approach relates
to other institutions', I sent a message to the SIGCSE-members mailing
list.  SIGCSE is the Association of Computing Machinery Special Interest
Group on Computer Science Education.  Writing to SIGCSE is one of the
easiest ways I know of to reach a range of thoughtful educators, and
I hoped for a wide range of responses.

Here's what I wrote, with the grammar corrected slightly.

> Dear SIGCSE Colleagues,

> I am writing to ask how your institutions interpret a credit hour and how closely your institutions ask you to stay toward that interpretation. At my institution, a four-credit class is supposed to represent approximately 180 hours of work, perhaps 60 hours in class and 120 hours out of class, or 45 hours in class and 135 hours out of class.  As we make plans for potentially different models of teaching or course lengths, we've been reminded of these 180-hour expectations.

> I've talked to some folks at other institutions who echo the 180-hour number for a four-credit class (mostly Deans/Provosts) and some who didn't associate a particular number of hours with a class (mostly faculty members).

> I don't think anyone (at my institution or elsewhere) has shared some context to the 180 hours: Is it for the student in the class who takes the most time, the one in the class who takes the average/median amount of time, the one who takes the least time, a mythical "average American college student"?  And is it for A-level work, B-level work, passing work?  (Or, for those who don't like grades, is it for mastery, for basic understanding, for something in-between?)

> I admit that I am particularly troubled by the "for whom?" question, since I see huge ranges for how long students might take on an assignment (and that seems to hold at every level of the curriculum, although the range narrows from, say, a factor of eight or more in introductory classes to a factor of four in upper-level classes).

> Anyway, I am interested to hear how others approach this issue.  If you would, please share your institution's practices with me and I'll share back with the list in a week or so.  (As list moderator, I would prefer to have a week of 'share data with Sam' and then discuss on the listserv after I share back.)

> What type of institution are you at (e.g., four-year liberal arts college, R1 university, community college)?

> How does your institution define a credit hour at the undergraduate level?

> How/how often does the institution reinforce that definition?

> If your institution uses an "hours worked" definition, how does it address the "For whom, and for what level of work?" question?  (Or perhaps, like mine, it doesn't.)

> How do you know whether your class meets whatever that definition is?

> Is there anything else you'd like to share about your own practices or the practices at your institution/department?

Now it's about a week later, so it's time to summarize for my community.
Here goes.

Dear SIGCSE Colleagues,

About a week ago, I wrote to the list to get feedback on how different
schools (or at least different faculty members) interpreted credit
hours for your classes.  My concern in dealing with my own institution's
definition is that it is vague about the questions of "For whom?"
and "For what grade?".  I know workload varies from students to
student, particularly in CS, and that the workload required for
A-level work is much greater than that required for C-level work.

I'm particularly interested in the issue as many institutions move to
"emergency remote instruction" (or whatever folks end up calling it
in the fall).  Work online seems very different than work in person.

Thank you very much to all those who replied and for those who
share my concerns.  I'll start with a summary of the responses,
along with some commentary, and then provide the somewhat anonymized
responses.

0\. Many people reminded me that the credit hour definitions are
there, in part, to satisfy accreditors.  I knew that and should
have mentioned it in my initial posting.  Because the definition
is to satisfy accreditors, I was also hoping to see the "for whom"
addressed since credit hours are supposed to be transferable between
institutions. How do we know they are equivalent if they are not
well defined?

1\. One respondent (K) noted that I was taking an American-centric view
(I was; I appreciate the correction) and pointed me toward the
European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and the Bologna Process.
I appreciate the opportunity to compare systems.  I appreciate that
the focus seems to be on learning outcomes more than hours spent.
However, since I teach at a U.S. institution, my primary interest
remains what people at U.S. institutions are doing.

2\. There appear to be two primary mechanisms by which people define
a credit hour.  

One is in terms of meeting times: Each hour (or, sometimes,
fifty-minute) meeting, along with about two-to-three hours of
work outside of class for each hour in class, across a fourteen-
or fifteen-week semester, represents one credit hour.

The other is in terms of time spent per class.  Forty-five hours
of work represents one credit hour.  Note that these forty-five
hours correspond closely to the amount of time you get with one
hour in class plus two hours out of class over fifteen weeks.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison guidelines help reveal these
correspondences.  <https://teachlearn.provost.wisc.edu/course-syllabi/course-credit-information-required-for-syllabi/>.

There are also variants.  One institution was able to argue
that their classes were so carefully designed that they cover
as much in 120 hours as most schools do in 180 hours.  (See response
H below.)

3\. Many institutions treat labs differently.  (I did not see a particular
rationale, and I consider it inappropriate to speculate as to why.)

4\. Although one respondent noted that faculty at their institution tend 
to think about B-level work when assessing workload, most do not seem to
consider the level of work..

5\. The consensus about "For whom?" seems to be "For the average
student (at the institution)." At least one respondent, with experiences
like mine, noted that the distribution of time worked on CS assignments
may not warrant taking the average.

6\. Most faculty use their own experience to assess how much time
tasks take.  Some rely on the Rice workload estimator,
<https://cte.rice.edu/workload>.  Of course, that estimator doesn't
address the kinds of assignments we most frequently give.  (Rice
doesn't estimate homework assignments, and its reading assignments
are almost certainly not reading assignments that involve careful
study of mathematical formulae.)  RIT also provides some guidance,
<https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/tls/course-design/online-courses/time-task>.

7\. For those who want further reading, there's a report from the
Carnegie Foundation on the credit hour (or, more precisely, the
Carnegie Hour, which is not quite the same).  
<https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/01/29/carnegie-foundation-says-credit-hour-although-flawed-too-important-discard>.  It appears that, at least in
the U.S., the outcomes-oriented folks are losing.

While I am frustrated by the lack of clarity (particularly because
credits transfer), I've come to understand it, at least for my 
institution.  Freedom to interpret the "For whom" and "For what
level of work" allows one to meet the HLC expectations while making
adjustments that you consider appropriate.  I still hate the bean
counting.

Thank you once again for your help!

A\. A small liberal-arts college

Since [School] has 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-credit courses, we have a worksheet to determine the appropriate credit load for a course (see summary below). The worksheet does not address the question of work hours for which students or what final grades, and I don't think it's addressed in any other documentation.

* One FIU  =  ~ 12 clock hours of direct instructional time over the course of a semester
* One SWU  =  ~ 24 clock hours of out-of-class student work time over the course of a semester
* Use the General Formula:  FIU’s + SWU’s  =  # credits for course

\- \- \- \- \-

B\. A public 4-Year liberal arts institution

We use a definition of "credit hour" that I have heard traces back to Carnegie units of the early 20th century (not that I've checked that myself). It's a very simple and dogmatic definition: 1 credit hour = 50 minutes per week of lecture instruction, or 100 - 150 minutes of lab activity, throughout a 15-week semester. There is an additional guideline that students should expect to spend 2 - 3 hours outside of class per week per credit hour. I suspect that most faculty here find this definition of credit hour a bit too rigid, and in some situations we simply assume that the people who develop a course know best how many credits to attach to it (e.g., I was peripherally involved in the creation of an online self-paced supplement to our first-year writing seminar, which students do as a 1-credit co-requisite to that seminar -- no-one seriously tried to figure out whether anything it does is "50 minutes per week of lecture"). On the other hand, the definition has also led to some rather silly decisions, such as the time a few years ago when final exam periods for 4-credit courses suddenly got 50 minutes longer because someone somewhere realized that those exam periods counted in the 50-minutes-per-week-per-credit calculation.

\- \- \- \- \-

C\. An R1 

I have used the UW Madison expectations (https://teachlearn.provost.wisc.edu/course-syllabi/course-credit-information-required-for-syllabi/) as a source, along with student evaluation comments and periodic student polls on time spent on course activities, to discuss whether a course should be either a 4 credit course or focus the workload a bit more for a 3-credit course. 

\- \- \- \- \-

D\. An R1

My understanding (and I have not done any research on this, based on what was conveyed to me) is the following:

1\. there is a state mandated number of "contact" hours or "instruction" hours. That seems to drive how long the semester has to be.

2\. online classes (in the pre-pandemic definition) had to go through a separate approval. I have not done one so I don't know what that entailed, but I suspect that the "contact" hours is seen differently for that type of course.

3\. the expected amount of work outside of class, and thus the number of hours, is mostly an informed guess? I have not seen anything official as to how much work this "mythical" student is supposed to do.

4\. The other context where this comes up is in terms of how many courses they can take per semester, and the measure of "full-time".  But that part starts getting to be a bit of a magical calculation.

Again, these are just approximations to what is true.

\- \- \- \- \-

E\. An R1

The university is fairly strict about in-person credit hours: 1 credit hour equals 1 in-class hour and (ideally) 2 out-of-class hours. So the typical four credit course is 12 hours per week, and my intro course is 5 credits so 15 hours per week.

It's not immediately clear to me (as a newish faculty member) whether this is designed to be the median or max, but I'd take it to be the max if we look at the overall full-time student workload.

My class has a mix of before-class preparation, in-class problem solving (many small problems approach), and after-class weeklong programming assignments. For the before-class prep and in-class problem solving, we release solutions very shortly after class and impress on students that, if they don't finish all of the problems, to spend 5-10 minutes reading and thinking seriously about the problem before using the solution to make progress. The weeklong programming assignments are more of an unknown, but I've typically let students know to not spend more than an hour debugging (since many novices don't necessarily have a good idea of what's designed to be challenging).

\- \- \- \- \-

F\. A four-year, private, predominantly undergraduate institution

Our catalogue uses the NEASC (New England Association of Schools and Colleges) standard definitions, which are likely pretty common:

Credits Awarded for Student Academic Engagement

Credits Awarded Minutes*        Clock   50-minute
                                Hour    "Hour"
1       2,250 (37.5 hours)      45      37.5
2       4,500 (75 hours)        90      75
3       6,750 (112.5 hours)     135     112.5
4       9,000 (150 hours)       180     150
5       11,250 (187.5 hours)    225     187.5
6       13,500 (225 hours)      270     225

GEN-11-06 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OFFICE OF POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY

Guidance to Institutions and Accrediting Agencies Regarding a Credit Hour as Defined in the Final Regulations Published on October 29, 2010

An amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than:

One hour** of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or
At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.

These are Awarded Minutes of Academic Engagement, adjusted for the NEASC 
50-minute hour**

** NEASC assumes a 50 minute "hour"

Within the engineering school we generally think about the two hours outside for every hour inside class - but that is pretty generic.  When assigning homework and projects we tend to think in terms of "B" students.  A students either take less time, or do more in the same time.  C students tend to do less, etc.  But tracking that is not hard and fast.  What we do track is time in class.  If the class is 50-minutes then each lesson should try to end between 45 and 50 minutes.  Running over is also frowned upon (mainly because it imposes on the class moving into the classroom).

G. A Comprehensive University

How does your institution define a credit hour at the undergraduate level?  

I'll just paste in our policy

> Credit Hours, Semester

> At [Unnamed] University, the number of credit hours awarded depends on the course workload and overall contact with the subject matter, including the amount of direct instruction and the amount of student study/preparation time.  A semester course typically requires two units of student study/preparation time for every one unit of direct instruction.  Credit hour minimums are the same for both the undergraduate and graduate level.  Actual hours of course work may exceed these minimums to ensure students meet course student learning outcomes.

> A direct instruction hour consists of 50 minutes of formalized faculty-directed instruction presented to students, either in a synchronous or asynchronous format.

> A study or preparation hour consists of 50 minutes of independent work, outside-of-class study, or preparation coursework that the typical student is expected to complete. Examples include, but are not limited to, reading assignments, working out problems, preparing for exams, completing online and face-to-face group work, writing papers, and working on a project.

> A semester credit hour is the amount of credit awarded for successful completion of a total of 2250 minutes of course work comprised of faculty-directed instruction and independent student work.  For example, one semester credit hour of traditional face-to-face lecture courses represents 750 minutes of direct instruction supplemented by a minimum of 1500 minutes of student independent study or preparation. An equivalent amount of time and work is required for shorter semesters or course duration.

> The ratio of direct instruction to independent student work may differ by modality of instruction, but all courses require a minimum of 2,250 total minutes of student work per credit hour (e.g., 750 minutes of direct instruction plus 1,500 minutes of study/preparation time).  A three credit-hour course requires a minimum of 6,750 minutes of interaction with the subject matter, including both direct instruction and independent student work.

> [Unnamed] University includes a week of final exams as part of the required minutes for full-term courses.  A laboratory course that meets for two or three class hours weekly over the course of a full term is considered equivalent to one credit hour.  Fully online courses include the same credit hour minimums as face-to-face courses. The credit hours for work in internships, practica, and student teaching vary.  Class and study time may exceed these minimums to ensure students meet course student-learning outcomes.

> The standard number of credit hours which each course carries is provided in the course description section of this catalog. The courses are listed in numerical order within the sections for the various academic departments.

> Faculty are responsible for ensuring that overall credit-hour minimums are met for each of the courses they teach, including the make-up of any unanticipated class cancellations that occur due to weather or other extenuating circumstances. Faculty may use alternative activities or assignments to make up missed class time.  It is general practice for faculty to notify their chairs when a class session is canceled.

How/how often does the institution reinforce that definition? 

I'm not sure if I understand the question. It's a policy and we tell everyone every year -- this is an accreditation issue so you shouldn't really mess around

If your institution uses an "hours worked" definition, how does it address the "For whom, and for what level of work?" question?  (Or perhaps, like mine, it doesn't.) 

I passed this question to Xavier's HLC accreditation rep. She says, "I’d say, estimate the average."

How do you know whether your class meets whatever that definition is? 

It is up to us to estimate this time ourselves. (There are some
tools, e.g.,
<https://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/tls/course-design/online-courses/time-task>
and <https://cte.rice.edu/workload>.)

\- \- \- \- \-

H\.  Private, non-profit, 4-year. Also MS and doctoral programs.

How does your institution define a credit hour at the undergraduate level?

A credit hour is 30 hours of work, regardless of in- or out-of-class splits.

How/how often does the institution reinforce that definition?

We attach hours to every class activity -- lectures, homework assignments, labs, even reading the textbook. We often use the Rice Course Workload Estimator at https://cte.rice.edu/workload. We try to balance out the number of hours per week and keep a 4-credit hour course at 120 hours.

If your institution uses an "hours worked" definition, how does it address the "For whom, and for what level of work?" question?  (Or perhaps, like mine, it doesn't.)

This has never been clear to me from our best practices documents. Averages are highly susceptible to outliers and we rarely have a section of a course with a sufficient enrollment to make that number statistically meaningful anyhow. 

How do you know whether your class meets whatever that definition is?

I typically don't know. However, I have recently taken to weekly surveys that ask this question. Over 12 weeks, I had 60 responses to this question (about 2/3 of the population) with an average of 13 hours per week, a median of 10.5 and a standard deviation of 7.7. Variance is incredibly high. Still, if I went with the median, my 12 week course comes out at 126 hours and I was targeting 120 hours for a 4-credit course. So, not too bad. I can't correlate these with grades since the surveys are anonymous.

Still, I don't really care that much about hours because of the high variances in student ability and experience. My focus is on whether or not students are meeting the outcomes of the course and each week within the course.

Is there anything else you'd like to share about your own practices or the practices at your institution/department?

We were asked once by our accrediting body about our use of 30 hours versus the Carnegie definition of 45 hours per credit hour. We use all "designed" courses -- every course is developed by a team of at least 3 people: an instructional designer, subject-matter expert, and faculty member. By careful outcomes mappings, specific topic selection, and highly focused assessments, we believe that we can achieve the same outcomes in 2/3 the time that a traditional college course designed and delivered by a single faculty member could do. Sometimes that works out, and sometimes it doesn't.

\- \- \- \- \-

I\. R2

Generally most places that I've been define "credit hour" by "contact hours" in the classroom - 50 minutes of class time is one credit hour. Thus, a 3 credit hour class meets for 3 50 minute sessions or 2 75 minute sessions per week.  The "out of class time" has always been a rule of thumb - 2-3 hours of work per credit hour knowing that some students read / process / etc. more quickly than others.  The only thing that is different are "labs" which are a 1.5 ratio - so 1 credit hour in lab is actually 1.5 contact hours.

Going hybrid or remote totally muddies the entire definition of credit hour. In general, we're told that a 3 credit hour class (which is most of ours) should be no more than 15 hours of "work" per week. The reasoning is that 12 credit hours is a full load, which would be 4 classes or 60 hours of work.  Of course, we know that not every week is identical in workload and some students take more than 4 courses per term.

How/how often does the institution reinforce that definition?

Not enforced other than student evaluations have a question that ask if the workload of the class is more, same, or less than other classes of the same credits.

How do you know whether your class meets whatever that definition is?

Guess.

\- \- \- \- \-

J\. Four-year liberal arts college

How does your institution define a credit hour at the undergraduate level?

14 weeks, 150 minutes class time per week, 3 hours out of class work for every hour in class.

How/how often does the institution reinforce that definition?

It is in the student handbook and many faculty include it in syllabi to set expectations.

If your institution uses an "hours worked" definition, how does it address the "For whom, and for what level of work?" question?  (Or perhaps, like mine, it doesn't.)

This is not addressed at all.

How do you know whether your class meets whatever that definition is?

Faculty intuition and experience, and student feedback.

K\. A European R1

Although I'm in Europe, and much of this may not help, perhaps some of it will, particularly the ECTS part (below).

What type of institution are you at (e.g., four-year liberal arts college, R1 university, community college)?

R1 (albeit, in Europe)

How does your institution define a credit hour at the undergraduate level?

We use ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System> - also worth seeing is the link there to the Bologna process). This is a standardized system for credits that is largely required in Europe. It's not super rigid however, as like most things done at the EU level, the Bologna process is effectively an agreed standard that countries then implement (normally only to compliance, not a true standard). Thus, differing interpretations of the standard, theoretically all compliant, often differ somewhat. Nonetheless, it is A LOT more standardized than the wild-west of academic credits that is the USA.

How/how often does the institution reinforce that definition?

The Bologna process also dictates that all modules (classes / courses)* are based on module descriptors which start with learning outcomes. So, all universities here have modules that all have module descriptors. Typically these are housed in an online system. Thus, they can be referred to by anyone, from the students to the president. Reinforcement is typically based on trust, but would follow a chain of command: module leader (typically the lecturer but not necessarily) ->.programme* director -> some school/faculty level board -> -> some college* level board -> university registry.

* here, modules are classes/courses, stages are years, a programme is the whole degree (one's whole course of study, e.g. BSc), schools are typically faculties, and colleges are groups of schools (say the college of science which oversees the school of CS, school of Physics, etc.).

If your institution uses an "hours worked" definition, how does it address the "For whom, and for what level of work?" question?  (Or perhaps, like mine, it doesn't.)

It's always the student effort. Typically about 3/4 of hours are "self study" or something similar. Face-time with the lecturer for undergraduate modules are typically 5 ECTS which in Ireland equates to 125 or so learner hours of effort. The actual lecturing time in my university might be about 24 hours with (in CS) 12 or 24 hours of lab. The rest would be accounted to assignments, self study, etc. Graduate courses typically have much less contact time. Perhaps 12 total contact for 5 ECTS. (So by now you've figured out that in Ireland 1 ECTS is about 25 hours of learner effort). In other European countries it's a little different but you'd have to look hard to find <20 or >30.

How do you know whether your class meets whatever that definition is?

We don't.

Is there anything else you'd like to share about your own practices or the practices at your institution/department?

I think I've covered it!

If you have questions, please ask. The Bologna/ECTS systems appear to be nebulous and enigmatic at first. But like I said, it's streets ahead of the anarchy in the US - if you consider standardization to be a good thing. I can say this - if a student with x ECTS wants to transfer to a university in Liechtenstein, it's super easy compared to transferring across the street in the US. From that point of view, it works.

What have I learned from all of this?  It appears that I worry more than
most.  Perhaps that's not surprising.

I've also realized that I don't get good responses to my questions at
Grinnell because we worry about the bean counters at HLC [4].  Maybe I
should take written language less seriously than I do and can choose
my own answers to my questions.  If I'm feeling particularly aggressive,
I can say,

> My course requires 180 hours by students in my traditional
face-to-face class who wish to earn a C in the course, assuming
that these students work at a rapid pace and face no real effects
from the pandemic.  Those who wish higher grades, who take more
time to complete work (in general or in the online offering), and
who have more challenging circumstances will necessarily find that
the course takes more time.

That policy is, of course, unfair.  It's also not something I would
ever say [5].  If I felt aggressive in a different way, I could
say,

> My course requires 180 hours by the average American college
student in order to earn an A, assuming that they work at about
half of their normal capacity because of the challenges brought on
by the pandemic, halved again because of the difficulties of working
online.  Those who work more quickly, who face fewer challenges,
and who are willing to accept lower grades will find that they spend
less time on the course.

That policy is also unfair.  Students come to Grinnell to be
challenged.  They deserve that challenge.  Perhaps I'll find a
solution that achieves that goal and keeps my students sane.  That
might satisfy me.  Perhaps that will satisfy them.

Will I still keep pushing on this issue?  Probably.  Will I muse about
it again?  Almost certainly.  Will I gain fellow travelers in my mission
to address workload?  I already have some.  I hope to get more.  Or maybe
my unrestrained comments will help my more restrained colleagues be more
successful in their own efforts.  

Here's hoping.

[1] If I recall correctly, it was added during Henry Rietz's tenure as
Chair of the Faculty.  I just can't recall whether Henry was CoF before
or after Elaine; I believe the answer is "after".  My memory is clearly 
going. (A quick check of my notes says after.)

[2] You can probably guess which I do.

[3] ACTs are not a particularly good proxy for grades, but I expect they
provide a bit of a proxy for the speed at which students can produce
a level of work.

[4] Do we worry that I keep calling them "bean counters" in my musings?
Presumably, that falls under the guise of academic freedom, which one hopes
HLC supports.  And I do have my disclaimer.

[5] Even though some students may think that this represents the typical
model for my classes, it does not.

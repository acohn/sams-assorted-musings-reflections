Old or vintage?
===============

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), technology, Apple*

As many readers know, whenever things go wrong with my MacBook, I switch
back to my "old MacBook".  In fact, the last time I switched to it [1],
I just stuck with it.  I believe I've said that I bought my old MacBook
as new five years ago.  But a part of my brain tells me that I bought
it as a like-new refurbished machine from Apple [2].

In any case, my old MacBook, and the one I'm writing on right now, is
a 15-inch [3], Mid-2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display.  I think it's
the first model of MacBook Pro with a Retina display.

However, it appears that I am no longer allowed to
think of it as an *old* machine.  Apple has now marked it as
[*vintage*](https://blog.macsales.com/45147-apple-adds-2012-retina-macbook-pro-to-vintage-list).
In about two years, Apple will decide that it is
[*obsolete*](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624).  What does
that mean, other than that I will now refer to the MacBook on which I'm
writing this musing as "my vintage laptop"?  It means that Apple will
no longer provide service for it.

Chrysler still services my twelve-year-old minivan.  Whirlpool still
services my decade-old fridge [4].  The no-name stove manufacturer
for my decade-old stove still sells replacement parts.  Why don't computer
manufacturers provide similar periods of support?

It's not like the MacBook doesn't work well.  While my now-vintage
laptop isn't perfect and there are times that I overwhelm it with the
number of things I try to do simultaneously [5], it generally gets the
job done.  That's one of the advantages of buying a powerful laptop
[6]; it continues to work for many years.  Although my "new" laptop has
the bit of extra power I need [7], I expect that it also will become
"vintage" in a year or so.

I wonder what I'm going to do when I next need repairs.

Postscript: You might think that I would be ranting about Apple's
policies.  But I'm not.  It costs money to keep production lines
in operation and supplies in the warehouse.  They've made a business
decision about how long they want to keep manufacturing [8] and storing
parts for older machines.  That's one of the things you accept when you
buy a Mac.  And there are others who find it valuable to provide parts
and repair services.

Postscript: One of my students thinks I should switch to cheap
built-it-yourself Linux laptops.  They are almost certainly more
straightforward to fix and upgrade than MacBooks.  But I've been using
Macs since the first Mac [9,10]; it's hard to give them up.  And, in
contrast to some Linux file managers, the Finder doesn't [stupidly delete
files without the hope of recovery](badly-designed-software-2018-07-28).
Plus, the form factor of MacBooks generally feels better than that of
other machines I've encountered.

[1] About two or three months ago, right at the beginning of summer
research.

[2] Whether the machine was "new" or "slightly used", five years have
passed since I bought it.

[3] It may possibly be 15.4" along the diagonal.  I still refer to it
as a "15-inch" laptop.

[4] At least I assume they would service it; I haven't tried to get 
service for a while.

[5] Eight or so Firefox windows, each with a dozen or more tabs, are
usually what seems to do it in.  The other eleven or more applications
that I have open almost certainly don't help.

[6] Not that mine is all that powerful.

[7] More precisely, the 8 Gb of extra memory.

[8] Or having others manufacture.

[9] I think the first Mac I owned was a 512Ke.

[10] We also owned a IIe in high school.

Eggnog (and other holiday memories)
===================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

The other day, I opened a bottle of pre-made eggnog.  (Eggnog
with alcohol, in case you were wondering.)  Strangely enough, it
brought back memories of my childhood.  What memories?  Well, when
I was young, my parents regularly threw a party which they to which
they assigned the politically incorrect name [1] of "Jews eat and
drink; Christians decorate the tree; choose your religion for the
evening."  So many aspects of that party flit through my brain,
from the attendees who believed that you should hang tinsel one
strand at a time to my father's tendency to purchase the tree at the
last possible moment.  I also recall the struggles mom and I had
after dad died, dealing with a few too-tall trees, particularly
getting them in the stand.  And, of course, there were the times
that one of the dogs [2] knocked over the tree.  Mom had some
beautiful goose egg ornaments that seemed to decrease in number
each year because of damage [3].

Where was I?  Oh, that's right.  Eggnog.  One of the long-time
attendees at the party, Michael S, always brought eggnog that he made.
This was the days before people worried about salmonella [4], and
he generally let the eggnog mellow for two weeks before the party.
I expect that the quantities of bourbon and whiskey that were in
the eggnog also kept down the dangers.  When I think of eggnog, I
think of Michael S's eggnog.  My memories of the taste are not
exact, but I look for the smooth mixture of whipped cream and eggs
along with the bite of the alcohol.

Middle Son is talking about making real eggnog again this year.
He's decided that he can use his *sous vide* device to pasteurize
the eggs while keeping them liquid.  We'll see.  I suppose we could
also try to get local eggs, which I think are less likely to have
salmonella.  I expect that we'll use the eggnog recipe in our
family's favorite cookbook, a late 1950's edition of _Fannie Farmer_.
I look forward to seeing what he comes up with.

Postscript: I wonder what Michael S. is doing these days.  What I
remember most about him, other than the eggnog, is that he drove a
Lotus [6] and that he was in a motorcycle "gang" of DEC [7] engineers
who called themselves the "roving gonads" [9] and regularly went out 
as a group for Chinese food.  I had some great dinners with them [10].

[1] Description?

[2] Sax was an Airedale-mutt mix; the shape and coloring of an
Airedale, but with straight hair and perhaps a bit larger than the
typical Airedale.  Phoenix was a Tibetan terrier: small, black and
stupid.

[3] The last one got broken last year.  Michelle and the kids worked
really hard to glue it back together.  It's back on the tree this year.

[4] Or Sam and Ella [5].

[5] Or Sam and Janet evening.

[6] At least when it was working.  Lotus-brand sports cars are
notably finicky.

[7] Digital Equipment Corporation [8].

[8] It was DEC, now it's RIP.

[9] Yes, they had women in the group.  As the party name suggests,
it was a time when people were less worried about the language they
used.

[10] At times, I look back at parts of my childhood and ask myself,
_What were my parents thinking?_

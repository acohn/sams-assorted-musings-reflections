The JRSR and SNRS course designations
=====================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), [Grinnell](index-grinnell)*

It's preregistration time at Grinnell.  In a few days, I'll write my
regular commentary about the end of preregistration.  Right now, I see
that my section of CSC 151 is among the most heavily enrolled courses,
with 25 students currently enrolled [1].  Intro Linguistics is close
behind at 24, but only first-year and second-year students can preregister
for that course.  And that brings me to the subject of today's musing,
the JRSR designation, which indicates that the course is "[n]ot open to
juniors [sic] or seniors during preregistration".  There's also a SNRS
designation, which indicates that the course is "[n]ot open to seniors".

I've been thinking a lot about those designations during this
preregistration period, particularly as my advisees are unable to register
for Intro Linguistics and Intro Gender, Women's and Sexuality Studies.
I have a few students who've shown an interest in Intro Linguistics,
but have not been able to get in because of the JRSR designation.  I've
seen fewer problems with Intro GWSS.

Here's the thing.  As far as I know, all disciplines end up prioritizing
potential majors and concentrators over those who are taking the course
because they consider it interesting and want to broaden their course
of study [2].  But most of us drop students after preregistration,
rather than beforehand.  And I think that's the better strategy.  Why?
There are a few reasons.

First, preregistration provides a record of the attempts.  Because the
system won't let them click the "Register" button, There's no way for
a faculty member to know that a senior has tried to register for Intro
Linguistics for the past three semesters.  There's no way to tell the
difference between a senior who included Intro Linguistics as one of
their top courses and one who decided to try it after getting dropped
from another class.  Our registration system exists, in part, to provide
such data.  These designations prevent the gathering of such data.

Second, it appears to prevent agency by the faculty member.  Someone
teaching Intro Linguistics might decide that a senior who has tried
for three straight semesters deserves priority over a second-semester
second-year student.  But they can't make that decision, since you
can't drop someone who has preregistered in favor of someone who did
not preregister.  Of course, it may be that the Linguistics Concentration
wanted to remove the burden of making that choice from individual faculty
members; I'm not sure.

Third, it's not always implemented correctly.  I had at least one senior
preregister for Intro Linguistics, only to discover a few days later
that they were no longer registered.  At least we discovered that soon
enough to make alternative plans early on.

So why have that designation?  One advantage is that it clearly signals
students that they have very little chance of getting the course after 
their first two years (or first three years, for the SNRS designation).
I'm not sure of others.

As far as I can tell, this semester there is only one course with the
JRSR designation (LIN-114, Intro Linguistics) and only two with the
SNRS designation (GWSS-111, Intro Gender, Women's & Sexuality Studies
and THD 117, Intrduction to Acting).  There were two other JRSR courses
in the fall: REL-102 (Studying Religion: America) and REL-104 (Studying
Religion: India).  There were three other SNRS in the fall, all 100-level
courses in Theatre.

It makes me wonder: What happened that the disciplines or faculty offering
the courses decided they needed to restrict preregistration in this way?
And why don't we make sure that we have enough staffing to permit more
sections of Intro Linguistics?

[1] I do have a cap of 32, so there's still room.  And we do cuts,
closes, and balances *after* preregistration, so students should still
feel comfortable registering for the class.

[2] Because they bridge approaches, Linguistics and GWSS both provide
great opportunities for broadening study.  Linguistics, in particular,
gives students experience with science, with the study of society,
and with a type of language study.

Swimming, diving, and parking
=============================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

This weekend is the annual Grinnell College [_Pioneer Classic_](https://pioneers.grinnell.edu/sports/2014/12/4/MSWIM_1204140526.aspx) [1,2]
swimming and diving meet.  I'm pretty sure that it's the largest
swimming and diving meet we host each year, except in years in which
we also host Conference championships [3].  I like attending swim
meets, not only because I want to support my students [4], but also
because of the mood of swim meets.  While the swimmers and divers
compete hard, they are quite supportive of each other.  It's nice
to see that support.  It also feels like the spectators do their
best to support all the swimmers; certainly, there's always a nice
round of applause when the last swimmer finishes any event.

Of course, having a lot of swimmers on campus means that we have a
lot of people parking.  Unfortunately, it appears that, even though
the event gets planned a year in advance, some magic force seems
to put things in the way.  Last year, someone scheduled a large
wrestling meet in Darby the same weekend as the _Pioneer Classic_.
This year, Pete Buttigieg decided to have an event in the Harris
Center, right across the street from the Natatorium.

Both events brought many more people to campus, making it much
harder for the swimming supporters (and diving denizens) to find
parking.  The Mayor Pete event also closed the Harris lot [5].  With
just the swim meet, parking would be fine.  With multiple events,
it's not.

Normally, it would not make a difference to me; I can walk from
home [6].  But I'd like it to be easy for the swim folks to find
parking.  And there are times that I'd prefer to be able to drive.
For example, today my foot is injured and I wanted to be able to
go to the Scout Tenderloin Dinner downtown before the meet.  Some
years, Michelle is on call and needs to be able to go back and
forth.

Why do these conflicts happen?  This year, it seems to have been
unavoidable.  Is there a solution?  I don't know of one.  Still,
it's frustrating.

[1] I do not know why the link for the 2019 meet uses a date of 2014.

[2] I seem to recall that it used to be called the Buddha Meet, back
when our teams were named the Buddhas.  These days they Dogs and the
Ducks.

[3] One of the spectators near me this year said that they think it's
even larger than Conference, or at least involves more schools.

[4] And, for many years, my children.

[5] I wish they'd give us more than twenty-four hours notice for
lot closures.  They certainly know about them more in advance.

[6] And did this afternoon.

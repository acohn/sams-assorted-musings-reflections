Raygun
======

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

Those of you not from the midwest may not know about
[Raygun](https://www.raygunsite.com/), the self-billed "greatest
store in the universe".  I believe Raygun started as a t-shirt shop
somewhere in Iowa, making somewhat snarky shirts.  Over the years,
they've grown to make snarky stickers, magnets, posters, and more.
They have stores across Iowa and beyond, including one in Kansas
City [1].  While I don't wear t-shirts much anymore, I appreciate
Raygun's shirts for a variety of reasons, not least that I find
many of them quite funny.  This week, I particularly appreciate
that their shirts for this year's Camping World Bowl [2] between
Iowa State and Notre Dame read "[Science vs.
Religion](https://www.raygunsite.com/products/science-vs-religion-2019)".
I like that they're cheesy enough to make shirts that refer to Cedar
Rapids the same way that I do, "[See the
Rabbits](https://www.raygunsite.com/products/see-the-rabbits-metal-magnet)".

I learn things from Raygun, too.  Raygun taught me that South Dakota
has adopted the slogan "Meth, We're On It" [3,4].  Raygun taught
me that Cedar Rapids is where Cap'n Crunch is made.  On some days,
you can even [smell the
crunchberries](https://www.raygunsite.com/products/smell-the-crunchberries-poster)
being made.  I probably should have known that already.

I'm not quite sure why my muse requested [5] this musing.  Perhaps
she, like I, particularly appreciated the new "Science vs. Religion"
shirt [6].

Postscript: I recall three shirts that Raygun made for Grinnell.
The first read "Grinnell, Jewel of the Prairie" and had a hip-hop
Prairie Dog with a big G on its chest [8].  The next read, "Grinnell,
your 1-stop shop for liberal education and firearms".  A third read,
"Grinnell conveniently located midway between New York City and Los
Angeles".

Postscript: One of my favorite Grinnell t-shirts, which the used
to sell in the bookstore and which President Kington is rumored to
have nuked, is the one that reads "Where in hell is Grinnell?" on
the front and "Who the hell cares?" on the back.

Another great Grinnell t-shirt read something like "Grinnell College,
150 years of anarchy and mayhem" [9].

Then there's the one I made during the "[Plans]" debacle: "The views
of the wearer are not necessarily those of Grinnell College."  I still
have nametags with that phrase.

And, while I own none of them, I must admit that many of the 10-10
T-shirts, particularly those that take off on alcohol brands, are
pretty amusing.

[1] The city so great it needs two states to hold it.

[2] I love the growth of strangely named shirts.

[3] Seriously.  They have pictures of, say, a rancher or a group of high
school football players, with captions that read "Meth, I'm [we're] on it".
I keep wondering whether their advertising agency was participating in a
"How much can we get away with?" competition.  If so, they almost certainly
won.

[4] Perhaps South Dakota should have used the Raygun phrase instead, "Don't Meth With Iowa".

[5] Insisted upon.

[6] Don't worry, Micki.  I'm not going to buy one [7].  

[7] At least not until they're on clearance.

[8] I had recalled it as being the Merchants' National Bank symbol, which
we do tend to use as our town symbol.

[9] I know that's not quite right, but it's as close as I can recall.

Words have power.

Anyone who has experienced a hateful taunt, a moving speech, or even
a kind word at at troubling time knows the power each word can have.

Some challenge the harmful effects of ceratin words, claiming that
concerns about word choice reflect a "PC culture".  Perhaps they have
never experienced the pain of having themselves or those like them
dismissed or insulted by the casual use of a derogatory term.

Certainly, those on the right acknowledge the power of words.  There's
a reason that they've claimed "fair and balanced" and that they are
now attempting to change "fake" from meaning "not real" to meaning
"that with which I disagree", at least when applied to news.

My goal is not to address those particular controversies.  Rather, it
is to reflect on the importance of context and consideration in word use.

Some harmful words are intended to be harmful and are not used without
an intent to harm.  Certainly, anyone who refers to me using the "k"
word means harm [1].  But some harmful words are used carelessly or
without thought.  It stings me when I hear people use my religion as a
verb that means "to bargain or negotiate".  But the people I've heard use
it don't realize they are being insulting [2].  As far as I can tell,
I'm the only person in the town of Grinnell that objects to the use of
derogatory slang in the name the Dari Barn uses for the Italian sausage
sandwich [3].  Most people I share my concerns with aren't even aware
of the underlying meaning.

I'll also admit that I also unintentionally use words that are insulting
or damaging.  I count on my students, colleagues, and friends to remind
me when I've done so.  I then try to improve.

Recently, two Facebook discussions have gotten me to think more about the
ways in which the context in which a word is used makes a big difference.
In one case, I had complained about one of the College's dozens of new
two-word taglines, "Live Vocally".  I noted that the tagline seems ableist,
emphasizing the ability to speak [4].  A colleague raised a reasonable
objection, saying, approximately, "The meaning is clear in a sentence
like, 'Sam objects vocally to the College's use of two-word taglines'. If
that use is not objectionable, why is this one?"  In a different discussion,
someone asked why it's not okay to call [week 14](naming-week-14), "Hell 
Week" [5], particularly since we are comfortable saying "Wow, this was a
hellish week" [6].  Admittedly, the colleagues' primary concern was that we
should focus more on making the week less difficult for the students who
find it such.  Nonetheless, I will focus on the discussion of language.

From my perspective, both of these cases

---

[1] I am fortunate that I cannot recall ever being called the "k" word.
However, I have had people walk up to me and say "You're Jewish, so ..."

[2] Perhaps they think they are being complimentary.  "I'm using it as
a metaphor for successful bargaining."

[3] The second word is "grinder".  The first word also starts with a "g".

[4] There's a second issue of having enough capital to be able to speak
out, which is likely the intended meaning.

[5] I apologize for the profanity.

[6] I've been known to say that, and I do tend to say it more frequently
toward the end of the semester.

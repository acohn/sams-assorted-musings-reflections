What would Joe say?
===================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), short*

Last night, I attended a panel on Joe Rosenfield '25 led by George
Drake '56.  I found the panel interesting, although I'm still not sure
what Joe did to inspire such devotion from others.  Certainly, he helped
a lot of people make money, but money alone isn't enough to explain the
kind of devotion people clearly felt for him [1].  He certainly made a
huge positive difference to Grinnell [2].  I'm not planning to muse
much about Joe right now; I need to read Drake's biography of Rosenfield,
[_Mentor_](https://bookstore.grinnell.edu/shop_product_detail.asp?catalog_group_id=LTM&catalog_group_name=RmVhdHVyZWQgSXRlbXM&catalog_id=793&catalog_name=RmVhdHVyZWQgSXRlbXM&product_name=TWVudG9yOiBMaWZlICYgTGVnYWN5IG9mIEpvZSBSb3NlbmZpZWxk&pf_id=11152&type=3&target=shop_main.asp), first.

I did appreciate one anecdote that George shared.  In the late
1960s, when Grinnell was debating making the dorms co-ed [3,4], the
Trustees were split between those who supported the change and those
who opposed the change.  Eventually, Joe spoke up and said
something like, "I support the change, provided we make it retroactive
to when I was a student."  As I understand it, the comment broke
the tension and the Trustees moved on to approve the change.

There weren't many students there.  On the way home from the panel,
Michelle and I were discussing what it would have been like if more
students were there, how they would have reacted to the comments
made at the panel, and what questions they might have asked.  I
hadn't asked a question [5], but one suddenly came to mind.

*What would Joe have said about the student union?*

Joe was a liberal democrat.  He made it onto Nixon's enemies list.
He was a public supporter of planned parenthood at a time when many
donated anonymously.  He helped fund _Tinker v. Des Moines Independent
School District_, a case that reached the Supreme Court and determined
that freedom of speech for students does not end at the school door
[6].  On the other hand, he led a major retail chain; my quick Web
search does not reveal whether or not Younkers workers were unionized.

I wonder not just what he would have thought about supporting the
student union, but also how we would have felt about the time and
process for considering the next steps.  I know that students are
frustrated at the time the Trustees are taking to reach a decision.
But I also know that they have a responsibility to consider not
just immediate implications but also long-term impacts.

In any case, I'm left to ask, "_What would Joe say?_"

Postscript: I'm not sure why I switched between last and first names
in this musing.  It seemed right.

---

Postscript: I realized retrospectively that some might interpret
"Joe" as "Joe Biden".  Nonetheless, at Grinnell, "Joe" should mean
"Joe Rosenfield".

[1] I think, for example, of John Ruan, who, after Joe died, would 
regularly have his chauffeur drive him up to Camp Mitigwa so that he
could sit by the statue he had donated in Joe's memory and think about
his friend.

[2] More precisely, he made a variety of huge positive differences
for Grinnell.

[3] Jon Andelson '70 tells me that it was necessary because the women
helped civilize the men.

[4] It seems strange to look back on a time when co-ed dorms were
considered inappropriate.  Nonetheless, it was a big move.  And I
recall visiting at least one college in recent years in which the
tour guide said something like, "We have co-ed dorms; the north
wing of one dorm has men and the south wing has women."

[5] Hard to imagine, isn't it?

[6] At least that's what I recall.  I see from [the ACLU site
about this decision](https://www.aclu.org/other/tinker-v-des-moines-landmark-supreme-court-ruling-behalf-student-expression) that I was pretty close.

> On Feb. 24, 1969, the court ruled 7-2 that students do not "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."

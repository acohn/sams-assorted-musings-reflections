Cuts, closes, and balances for Fall 2017
========================================

[Preregistration for Fall 2017](prereg-2017F) is now over.  Cuts, closes,
and balances are now over, and add/drop period has started.  Do you wonder 
how things went?  Let's see ...

_American Studies_

Katya cut _Cultural Politics of Fashion_ down to 15.

_Studio Art_

They cancelled the over-enrolled section of ART 111, _Introduction
to the Studio_[1].  There are seven slots remaining in remaining
two sections, but those are now closed, presumably to leave room for
intro students.

Art does not seem to have been able to offer another section of
_Drawing_.  That's too bad.  Seventeen students who wanted to do art
can't [2].

_Biology_

Biology seems to have mostly handled the over-enrollments in BIO 251, 
_Molecules, Cells, & Organisms w/lab_, although each section is now
over-enrolled by about two students.  They also cut one section,
presumably to deal with the over-enrollment in 300-level classes.

At the 300 level, Biology seems to have tried an interesting approach.
They've taken the twelve-person seminar/lab classes and turned two of
them into eighteen-person seminars with separate labs of nine students.

_Chemistry_

They've added a fifth section of _Organic Chemistry I_ and two additional
sections of the corresponding lab.  Even with that expansion, every
section is over-enrolled by three or four students [3].  Let's hope
that they are able to hire for the course and labs!

They've left _Instrumental_ over-enrolled by four and _Physical Chemistry I_
over-enrolled by sixth [4].  But they do seem to have added another
section of lab to help balance things out.

_Classics_

MC seems to have cut a bit, but still has twenty-six students in her
_History of Ancient Greece_.

_Computer Science_

We balanced the two sections of _Algorithms and Object-Oriented Design_.  We
have three open slots between the two sections.

We cut a bunch of students from _Computer Organization and Architecture_.
We have twenty-six students in a twenty-four student, lab-based class.

We balanced the two sections of CSC 301, _Analysis of Algorithms_.  I
think I signed an add slip today, so we're down to four open slots.

We left CSC 321 over-enrolled by seven students, CSC 322 over-enrolled
by eleven students, and CSC 341 over-enrolled by three students [5].

We left CSC 395 over-enrolled by one student.  I think Titus promised
a slot to another student, too.

_Economics_

Economics continues to look like it's in reasonable shape.  One of the
seminars even has some room.  But that doesn't make sense, since I know
that they had more folks sign up for seminars than they could hold.  
Perhaps some students forgot to enroll.

_English_

They cut _The Craft of Fiction_ back down to fifteen.  Twenty-two students
will not get a chance to do creative writing.  I wonder if they've offered
those students another option.

_History_

It looks like the History department has mostly managed to balance
things out.  HIS 266, _History of Modern Middle East_ is over-enrolled
by two students and [Sarah](sarah-purcell)'s seminar remains
over-enrolled by three.

_Humanities_

The faculty teaching our Humanities special topics are clearly generous.
_The Politics of Human Thriving_ is over-enrolled by fourteen [6] and
_Mental Health Policy/Outreach_ is over-enrolled by four.

_Mathematics and Statistics_

MAT 209, _Applied Statistics_, seems to have closed.  That's strange.
There was some room when last I checked.  But they are over-enrolled
by one between the three sections.

MAT 215, _Linear Algebra_, has seven open slots after balancing.  Let's
hope that's enough for the incoming class!

As I expected, they bumped some students from _Graph Theory_ to

They balanced the two sections of MAT 310, _Statistical Modeling_.
I think that means they had to cut eleven students.  It looks like they
also cut nine students from _Prob Stats I_.  Our Statistics concentration
is popular, and the College needs to find ways to support it better.

_Music_

They've left _Music, Mind, & Brain_ over-enrolled.  They've cut the nine
extra who were in Mark's _Topics in American Music: Hip Hop_ [6]

_Physics_

As expected, they've balanced the two sections of _Modern Physics Lab_.

They've left _Electromagnetic Theory_ over-enrolled by six and _Ad Lab_
by one.

_Political Science_

They've cut twenty-two students from ConLaw to bring it down to its cap 
of 25.  They've cut eleven from _Politics of International Relations_
to bring it down to 26, one over its cap.  Wayne has left _US Foreign
Policymaking Process_ over-enrolled by eight students.  I wonder where
the students cut from the other courses went.

_Psychology_

_Health Psychology_ and _Cross-Cultural_ remain over-enrolled.

_Religious Studies_

_The Crusades_ is back down to its cap of 20.  It looks like 19 were cut.

_Sociology_

It looks like they balanced intro.

It looks like the had to cut twenty-two from _Deviance and Social Control_
[8].

_Social Studies_

_Politics of Human Thriving_ and _Ethical Leadership_ remain over-enrolled.

Did I learn anything from doing that?  I learned that the College needs
to find more avenues for student creativity.  We cut large numbers from
Studio Art and _The Craft of Fiction_, and it doesn't look there's
much else available.  I saw, more clearly than ever, that there are
some departments that say "Screw it, students need to take our courses,
we'll just let them over-enroll or find a way to add sections" and there
are departments that say "We have caps for a reason".  There are also
a few faculty who say "If students want to take my class, I'll let them."
You can guess which camp I fall into.

But I also understand the "We have caps for a reason" group.  The experience
is less good for students in a class that is over-enrolled.  The workload
is higher on the faculty member.  And, in the end, it sometimes seems like
if you keep making accommodations, there's no incentive for others to give
you the resources you need.

You may be wondering where all the students who were cut for classes go.
I wonder the same.  But we've just started the add/drop period for those
students, so I'm going to wait until the end of that period before doing
a more careful analysis [9].  We will see.

[1] Now, I don't think the Art department did this voluntarily.  The
College places some strange unexpected demands on departments, and Art
got it by one.

[2] Actually, it's 37 students, if we include the students who were in
the now-dropped section of ART 111.

[3] They have 136 students between the five sections.

[4] 30 students in a 300-level Chemistry class seems excessive.

[5] CSC 341 already has a cap that's about four too big, so that's
particularly problematic.

[6] Caleb is also teaching the over-enrolled _History of Modern Middle
East_.

[7] My previous notes say "five too many", but the spreadsheet I kept
says nine.  Oh, that's right, the musing used 6 p.m. data, and the 
spreadsheet is from the next morning, after the remaining six hours of
changes were made.

[8] How's that for social control?

[9] I also need to wait until I have more time.

As I've written [1] recently, I lacked time, mental energy, and the
appropriate state of mind to muse this fall.  I found one positive
side effect of my failure to muse: I spent much less time on social
media.  When I muse, I usually post my musings to Facebook and
Twitter [2].  And when I go on Facebook or Twitter, I often find
things to look at and read.

It's not like Facebook and Twitter don't try to entice me to visit
at other times.  "Your friend just posted something new."  "Five
of your friends recommend this page."  "Your colleague has retweeted
something."

But around the time I stopped musing, I also decided to stop reading
social media.  Why?  While I appreciated the connection that that
social media gave me [3], at times time on social media felt like
too much of a time sink.  In addition, enough modern politics and
pandemic politics dominated discussions that most of my time online
felt like it affected me negatively.

In some ways, it's been hard.  Those "Your friend updated their
status" messages make me want to check in.  And I know I missed at
least one live performance by my oldest friend.  Michelle has spent
too much time asking me "Did you see this on Facebook?" and, when
she remembers that I wouldn't, filling me in on things.

I'll also admit that I haven't been pure; I have checked both
Facebook and Twitter once in a while.  I connect to Facebook because
there are some friends I only communicate with on Messenger.  And
when I'm setting up Messenger, I often see interesting posts.  Still,
I've limited my time.

I know that I'm not alone in avoiding Facebook and Twitter.  And I know 
that many people have better reasons than I.  So I'm not trying to
claim any great epiphany or even recommend anything to you.  My muse
just thinks I should share.  Why?  Perhaps she [4] wants me to explain
why I'm once again posting on Facebook but still not responding to
anyone else's posts.  Perhaps she wants me to decide whether I am
better off without Facebook and Twitter [5].  Perhaps she wants
to raise the somewhat existential question of why I would expect
anyone to read my musings if I don't read their posts.  Muses are
sometimes hard to grok [6].

In any case, although I'll be back on Twitter and Facebook to post
links to musings [8], I probably won't be commenting on or responding
to other folks' posts.  I hope you'll understand.

See you in the funny papers [9].

[1] Mused?

[2] More precisely, I post links to my musings on Facebook and Twitter.

[3] And would likely still give me.

[4] My muse identifies as female.

[5] I think I am.  

[6] "grok" is a word coined by Robert A. Heinlein.  At least I think
he coined it [7].  Many in my circles use it to mean "understand" or
"understand deeply".  Why not just use "understand"?  That's a good
question.  I don't have an answer, other than that "grok" has fewer
syllables.

[7] One might argue that he adapted it from the Martian.

[8] I got it right that time!

[9] My muse suggested I end with that.  I'm not quite sure why.  But
if I've learned anything in these years of musing, it's that I should
listen to my muse.

Losing it
=========

Yesterday, I heard these words for the *n*th time: "The size of the student
body hasn't changed.  The Trustees don't understand why the size of the
faculty should have to change."  At that point I think I lost it.

After that meeting, I wrote to my Council reps to say something like,

> Our Trustees are smart people; they should understand that maintaining
our reputation requires making sure that we not only address student
demand for certain disciplines, but also sufficiently staff departments
that provide core areas of liberal arts education [1].

This morning, I wrote to [Kate Walker](kate-walker), our treasurer,
to ask if I could apply the same reasoning to the number of majors,
what criteria she wants me to use in deciding who can and cannot be a CS
major, and whether I can use those same criteria in cutting our current
majors to a "budget neutral" level [2].

This morning, I also replied to the Tutorial and Advising Committee's
suggestion on how to handle the advising load in our department.  Since my
experience is that people don't understand quite how bad it is in our
department, I gave some numbers, too.  The rest of the message was, in
essence "What you suggested doesn't work.  Come up with something else."

It's also not just the stress that these loads put on the faculty, it's
the stress they put on the department culture [3] and the limitations they
put on the level of individual attention that our students can receive.

Yeah, I've definitely lost it.  I suppose that I've been working with
the fantasy that we will soon have sufficient resources.  Yesterday's
meeting crushed that fantasy.  It's hard to push forward without having
some sense that things will get better.  

I'm oh-so-tempted to just cut students from classes and have them complain
to the Dean that they can't complete the major in time.  I'm similarly
tempted to cut the extra section of CSC 151 which means that we won't
have nearly enough slots for incoming first-years.  They can complain
to admissions about being misled.  But I won't do that because students
should not suffer for decisions that are out of their control.

*Hey, Sam.  It's time to take a deep breath.  Think about the cool
projects you'll soon go over in CSC 151.  Think about why you chose
this job.  Think about the rewards of what you do.  And think about your
[privilege](owning-your-privilege).*

Oh well, at least we have awesome students, alums, faculty, and staff.

[1] I said some less-nice things, too.  None were directed at my Council
reps.  Michelle says that I shouldn't rant in public about poor decisions
I think the Trustees have made over the time I've been at Grinnell.  So
I'll stick with "I said some less-nice things, too."

[2] No, I do not plan to cap the number of majors or to cut majors.  But
I want others to understand the aburdity of what they are saying.

[3] Which causes more stresses on the faculty and students.

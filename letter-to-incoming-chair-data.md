Useful data (part of a draft letter to the incoming chair)
==========================================================

_I've now completed [the first few sections of my letter to the 
incoming chair](index-incoming-chair).  Those sections deal with
the various tasks for which the chair is responsible.  In this
section, we turn to the many sources of data that the chair may want
to (or need to) rely upon in doing their work.  As always, I've probably
missed some_

In the course of your work as Chair, you will receive a variety of data.
You will also have to go in search of some data.  These data can
help you do short-term and long-term departmental planning, provide
evidence for departmental needs, and support you in other departmental
responsibilities.  I've listed a variety of sources.  Remember that you
can often ask offices on campus for data.  For example, Carlie VanWilligen
in the Office of Analytic Support and Institutional Research (OASIR)
can provide you with most kinds of enrollment and demographic data you
need and Admissions can help you with predicting student interests.

_The Department Snapshot_

Once per year, the Dean's office sends us a "Department Snapshot".
The snapshots have been getting smaller and smaller each year.  For
example, the 2014-15 snapshot included a list of faculty workloads, a 
leave schedule, our self-study schedule, a table of accumulated MAP
credits, a list of who had taught Tutorial over the past decade (and
when), a list of who had taught other service courses and concentration
class over the past decade (and when), a list of all courses taught
by department faculty, numbers of majors, and perhaps a bit more.  In
contrast, the 2016-17 snapshot contains only the leave schedule.  The
other information comes in in dribs and drabs at other times, or you 
need to request it, or both.  

_Department data sheet_

OASIR posts a series of department data sheets to

_End-Of-Course Evaluations_

You should read each faculty members' End-of-Course Evaluations.  These
are available in electronic form from the Academic Support Assistants.
The ASA's may not have the summary sheets.  In those cases, you can
ask them from Carlie.

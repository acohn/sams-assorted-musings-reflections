Achieving sympathy
==================

[Our upper-level software design practicum](csc321-and-csc322)
involves teams of five or six students who work together to develop
software for a local nonprofit.  The team is responsible for a lot.
They must coordinate with the partner and with a remote "supervisor";
they must prepare supporting documentation not only for users but also
for the next set of students who will extend their project; and they
must prioritize and allocate tasks among the group.

Today, I walked in on a discussion between some members of a group about
another member of that group.  It appears that although the whole group
had divided tasks and that member had agreed to work on a particular
task with another member of the group, they decided to work on their own
and on something that the group had not identified as a high priority.
The group members were naturally upset and I think the person who lost
a partner was hurt.

So we talked about what to do.  They had confronted their partner. The
partner had basically responded, "Can't we just leave that behind us and
move on?"  But the other members of the group were having difficulty
moving on.  I would, too.

I suggested that they talk to the other member of the group in "I" language.
"When you decide to work without me, I feel undervalued."  "When you work
on something other than what we planned, I worry about how well I've
communicated our project needs [1]."

I also offered to talk to the student directly.  I'm a bit blunt, so I
offered to say something like "If you ignored a project team's decisions
and blew off a partner in the real world, you'd probably be off the team
and possibly out of a job."

But then I took a deep breath and said what I should have said to start
with.

> This semester has been hard.  I've seen a lot of students with
problems.  Some are coping with health issues.  Some are facing financial
issues.  Some are concerned about issues at home.  Many of our seniors
are worried about post-Grinnell employment [2].  Some are dealing with
friends who are facing serious issues [3].  And some are facing issues
they won't tell anyone about.  So, as hard as it is to do, it may be that
you have to say to yourself "Something may be going on with my teammate.
I've told them my concerns.  Let's move on."

That's also a good reminder to myself.  I can tell students when I have
concerns (about their lack of attendance, late or inadequate work, 
or whatever), but I should also remember that there are other issues
at play and therefore "move on" after talking to them.  And I should
have similar sympathy for my peers.

[1] Okay, it's clear that I'm not all that good at "I" language.

[2] That worry seems particularly pronounced in CS.  Many of our seniors
have taken jobs, so some of those who have been less successful or who
have not started their search are feeling a bit panicked.  They shouldn't
be; our placement rates are generally high.  But it's still frustrating.

[3] Yes, I've watched students lose a lot of sleep and spend a lot of
time and energy on other students.

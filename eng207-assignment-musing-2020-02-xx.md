Sitting in the waiting room at the hospital, day after day, unsure
if things will ever change.   Having an alarm go off fifteen minutes
before class, realizing that I've forgotten to prepare, or even
that I was teaching class that day.   Missing my session at a
conference because I was out with friends and forgot I had
responsibilities.  Returning to the house on Billings park only to
find that it hasn't changed, except for that important missing
presence.  A spinning body too close to a fiberglass board.  These
are the kinds of things that haunt my dreams.

Two new candidates are hoping to join the list: Having to present
my writing in a Grinnell writing workshop and my inability to go
beyond trite metaphors.

We workshopped the first pieces in _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_
on Tuesday.  I feel fortunate that mine was not one of the first pieces;
it's always intimidating to go first.  As an instructor, I am tempted
to be a bit kinder to those who have to precede their peers.  But I find
that I often end up being particularly critical, at least in public, so
that their peers don't repeat their mistakes.  Maybe I'm kinder in the
grading, if not the public criticisms.

I would have liked a bit more guidance.  We were reading memoirs,
all of which were painful in some way.  How do you comfortably
critique memoir writing?  "You didn't twist the knife hard enough
at this point."  "Readers will have trouble believing this important
scene in your life."  "Your life story seems trite."

In any case, I found myself impressed by the ways in which the
students in the class approached the workshop.  Most had read the
pieces multiple times. And they had read them closely.  I heard
careful and clever comments about sentence structure, the rhythm
of the pieces, vocabulary and word choice, and so much more.  The
student who I think of as "Ralph Jr." [1] would often make a pointed
criticism and then Professor Savarese would note that he was going
to say the same thing.  Students brought in sociology, queer and
feminist theory, and other things I couldn't comprehend. A poet in
the class paid close attention to language.  And they did so in a
way that was supportive, rather than undermining.

I shouldn't have been surprised.  They are, after all, Grinnell
students.  And I shouldn't have been suprised at the effort that
went into the writing, from powerful metaphors to careful language
choice.

You'd think that a workshop that I discribed as supportive would not
be intimidating.  But I know that my creative writing needs work,
particularly because I have trouble with so many aspects of creative
writing



This semester, I'm auditing Ralph Savarese's ENG 207, _The Craft
of Creative Nonfiction_.  It's intimidating.  The students are
smart, creative, and close readers.  That's not suprising; they
are, after all, Grinnell students.  And Professor Savarese is direct.
That's good; you don't need to worry whether or not he's giving
false praise.  He wouldn't.

My first writing assignment is due on Tuesday, 11 February 2020.
Why don't I write *our* first writing assignment is due then?
Because we workshop pieces, and so only a few pieces are due at a
time.  In addition, by spreading out the due dates, Prof. S is able
to get us to write in different genres and subgenres.  I'm in group
2B, the first group that is tasked to write about travel or place.

What does a writing assignment look like for this class?  Not like
I'd expected.  It goes something like this.

> Pick one of the pieces that we've read in this genre or subgenre.

> Identify some techniques the writer uses in that piece and assign
  yourself to use them in your piece.

> Write a five-to-six page piece.

The structure reveals both simplicity and complexity.  We are
mimicing parts of a professional piece of writing, but we are not
to mimic the overall piece.  Not so much chameleons as, um, something
else.  The two related tasks of identifying structural and stylistic
elements and then attempting to replicate them should help us grow
as writers, provided that those atttempts do not appear forced.

What pieces can I choose between?  That's more complicated than it
might seem.

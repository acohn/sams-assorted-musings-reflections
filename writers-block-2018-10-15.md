Writer's block
==============

*Topics/tags: [Writing](index-on-writing), [overcommitment](index-overcommitment)*

For the past month, I've been suffering from a bout of writer's block.
It's not that I haven't been able to write.  I've written daily musings
almost every day.  I've even written some musings that I'm unlikely
ever to post [1].  I've written reviews [2].  I've written way too many
letters to Council members and other folks about College policies [3].

But my textbook writing?  Almost nothing.  And it's weird because that
should be my "bread and butter" writing; I've written course materials
regularly for decades.  Now, it is true that most of the time I write
course materials, I'm under a tight deadline, and the deadline helps
motivate me.  But readings and labs almost always come easily, and they
haven't been.

I've been good at finding distractions.  Or maybe distractions
have been good at finding me.  I learned the basics of writing
a new language in Racket from the first section of [_Beautiful
Racket_](https://beautifulracket.com/).  And yes, that's relevant to
the overall project, although I can't yet explain why.  In addition,
because I'm using [Scribble](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/) as
my formatting tool, I've been writing code to improve the formatting of
what I have written.  It's way too easy to get sucked into the wormhole of
"I don't like this aspect of the formatting; I should write a procedure
or macro".  In the end, that time is worth it.  But I should be getting
words down on paper (or bits down in a file).

Today, I tried something a bit different.  After making a little forward
progress on the stuff that's been my sticking point, I said to myself,
"It's time to try to write another section."  And I got that section done,
a nearly complete rewrite of some old 151 material.  In a day filled with
meetings and appointments [4], I still managed to draft 2000 words [5].
It's not as much as I usually write in a day, but it's forward progress.

Our department's external review and our other big task for the semester
are complete, Grinnell is on break next week, and I've made a bit
of forward progress on the writing. Hence, I am hopeful that I can
continue to make forward progress over the next few weeks.  It helps
that I'm presenting again to the Obermann seminar in about two weeks [6].
That gives me an incentive to get things done.

Fingers crossed!

Postscript: Of course, there are many different things to worry about
after fall break.  I'm on the Division Personnel Committee, and we have
at least one meeting this semester.  I have to attend the primary meeting
of the Innovation Fund committee.  Preregistration runs from November
5 through November 15, and I promised to be available for my advisees
[7].  Plus, I have to finish rewriting my SIGCSE papers by the December
1 deadline.

But that's all after break.  For now, I'm going to focus on my textbook
writing.

---

Postscript: There were some other things I had planned to do this
fall, such as work on Grinnell's implementation of Project Callisto.
Unfortunately, given where things stand with the textbook, I think those
will have to wait until Winter break, at the soonest.

---

Postscript: I think I also have to "just say no" to worrying about
policies at the College.  I don't know if I can do that, but I'm going
to try.

---

Postscript: My distractibility this semester, particularly the effects
of department and institution issues, suggests that I really do need
to separate myself from the College when I'm on sabbatical next year.
My Fellowship required that I continue service at the College.
My sabbatical should not [9,10].

---

Postscript: I had thought that the four postscripts set a record.  But
no; there were about four others that had four.  Of course, now that I've
added this fifth one, it does break the record.  I wonder if I'm only
writing postscripts to avoid writing the textbook.

[1] Sometimes writing a rant is enough, I don't need to share it with
the world.

[2] Well, meta-reviews.

[3] As you may recall, I've been [grumpy](grumpy-2018-10-04).

[4] Five pages, using the current formatting.

[5] Meeting with the chair at eight am.  Office hour meetings from
nine to ten am.  A department meeting at noon.  Office cleaning at
two pm.  A faculty meeting at four pm.

[6] Agh!

[7] Let's see.  If I have about 40 advisees, and each needs a
thirty-minute appointment, that's about twenty hours I should make
myself available over those two weeks.  But three advisees are abroad
this semester, and two will be abroad next semester.  Those are advising
activities that can happen outside of the school day.   On the other
hand, I can't expect that my schedule will fill precisely.  I'll plan
to be on campus on Monday and Thursday each of those two weeks; that
should be more than enough [8].

[8] The Innovation Fund Committee meeting is Friday the 16th, but I can
work on campus the rest of the day.  I'm differently productive in town,
but I can still be productive.

[9] I'll keep my ten-or-so advisees in the classes of 2020 and 2021.

[10] I realize that there's a movement afoot to require faculty who are
staying in town for their sabbatical to serve on committees.  I consider
that an unreasonable and inequitable expectation and will do everything
I can to oppose it.

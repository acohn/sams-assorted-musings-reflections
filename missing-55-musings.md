Missing fifty-five musings
==========================

As most of you who use Facebook know, Facebook regularly populates your
page with "Your memories on Facebook."  Since most of my Facebook postings
are links to my musings, it's an interesting way to see what I was thinking
about a year prior.

A few days ago, I mused about [being a workaholic](workaholic-2018-02-10),
the first in a series about my workaholism.  What had I written a year
previously?  I'd been [complaining about
captioning](complaints-about-captioning-01) on the
[pioneers.grinnell.edu](http://pioneers.grinnell.edu) Web site [1].
The complaints were useful; the videos got captioned better.

But that's not what I'm musing about today.    The captioining complaint
was musing #226.  The workaholic reflection was musing #536.  While it's
cool that I'd written more than 300 additional musings, it appears that
I only wrote 310 musings in exactly one year.  Weren't these supposed to
be daily musings?  If so, what happened to the other 55 [2]?  I knew that I'd
missed a few days, but I hadn't realized that it was so many.  

Let's hope that when musing #536 is a year old, I'll be on musing #901.

Postscript: Why did I pick that particular pair of musings?  Because it's
when I "did the math" about the difference.  I sketched this musing when
I discovered the issue.  Then I set it aside for a few days until I had
time to edit it [3].

[1] I love the student photos on that site.  But I hate that whenever I
go to the site, I get a popup that says "Please remove your ad blocker for
a better experience."  I'm sorry, but if you're doing something that
sets off the ad blocker, it's you, not me, who should change.  And I really
think someone needs to do a manual accessibility check, rather than relying
on tools that, say, ignore all the Javascript-created content.

[2] Just in case that wasn't clear: There are 365 days in a year.  I
mused 310 times.  365-310 is 55.  I'm therefore missing fifty-five 
daily musings.

[3] Or, more precisely, until an evening in which I did not have a lot
of time to muse and thought that cleaning up a drafted musing would be
faster than writing a new one.

Depression
==========

**This musing is in draft form and is not intended for public release.**

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

I suffer from depression and anxiety.  That's not "I am depressed
and anxious." I have clinical depression and anxiety, the kinds
that give me very high scores on the assessments I get from my
physician, spared from the top only in that I am not suicidal.  The
kinds that make it nearly impossible to get out of bed some days
or to complete even simple tasks, like sending an email message.

There are some who might suggest that I should not make such a
public statement.  But depression and anxiety are medical conditions.
I'm not afraid to say that I'm obese, or that I have sleep apnea,
or that I suffer from arthritis [1], or that I'm left-handed [2].
So I should not be afraid to state publicly that I have depression
and anxiety.

As I've said many times in the past, I clearly have a wonderful life.
I have a wonderful family.  I get to do meaningful work that I enjoy,
and I get compensated well from it.  Unfortunately, that's not enough
to stave off these conditions.  Perhaps that's not surprising; I'm
pretty sure that the evidence is that depression and anxiety have
many factors, and many of the key ones are intrinsic, rather than
extrinsic.  That is, they are caused by the chemicals in our bodies
and the wiring of our brains, not by our current situation.

How do my depression and anxiety manifest themselves?  In many ways.
And, like my arthritis, they vary in intensity.  There are times
they are just a small annoyance, with little effect on my everyday
life.  There are others in which they feel nearly paralyzing.  Just
as there are days that my ankles hurt to much to conceive of walking
more than a little, there are also days in which I cannot bring
myself to do anything productive.

Nonetheless, I have learned that there are ways that I can counter
them, at least in terms of getting things done.  Structure helps.
If it's just a matter of doing the same thing at the same time every
day, and I've managed to get my day started, things often go okay.
One of the key aspects of self-gov also helps; when the thing I have
to do affects others, I ability to do it.

I do not know if my experience of these conditions is the same as
those others have.  I do know that I've had some wonderful students
who have had difficulty living up to their potential because of the
conditions.  Like them, I find that these conditions can significantly
interfere with what should be everyday tasks, whether it's doing
homework [3] or communicating with people.  I do seem to be a
comparatively high-functioning person with depression and anxiety,
although I can't speak to the reasons.  Perhaps I have other
characteristics that help counteract these conditions.  Perhaps
I've been successful in structuring my work to counteract the
conditions.  I recall from Carol Dweck's _Mindset_ that there's
some evidence that those with growth mindset cope better with
depression.

Do I want you to treat me any differently now that you know this
about me?  No.  I am who I am.  I hope that the way you treat me
is shaped by your interactions with me and by how I ask you to treat
me.  Okay, I'll admit that I'd like a little bit of understanding
when I say "I really can't get that done right now", but I'd hope
you would have given me that understanding even if you had not read
this musing.  I admit that I fear that I might get less responsibility
because some might decide that my conditions would interfere with
my ability to get things done.

So, why did I muse about my depression and anxiety?

One reason is that my muse insisted that this was the time to do
so.  I woke up at 5 a.m. today, and all that I could do was plan
the structure of this musing.

Another reason is to normalize the condition.  As I said earlier,
depression and anxiety are like other medical states; they are part
of who we are, and there should not be a stigma attached to them.
Perhaps by making it clear that someone who people respect [4] has
these conditions, I'll make it easier for others to acknowledge
their own conditions and to ask for help or accommodations [5].

On a similar note, I guess I hope to give some hope to others who
also suffer from depression and anxiety.  In spite of these conditions,
I have a wonderful life and satisfying career.

Finally, I hope that this musing encourages my colleagues to have
a bit more sympathy for students who tell them "I just couldn't get
the work done within the required time frame".  For some, depression
or anxiety may have been the cause, and they don't want to tell you.
For some, it may be personal matters, or other issues.  But there are
many factors that contribute to a student's inability to complete work
promptly, and we should sympathize [6].

Postscript: I thought about waiting until I took Ralph's course on
the Craft of Creative Nonfiction before writing this musing.  But it
felt like the right time.  Perhaps I'll write a better version after
Ralph's course, assuming he allows me into it.  Perhaps he'll take
this musing as a sign that I have enough skills to succeed in his
course.  Perhaps he'll take the musing as a sign that I need his course.  
We shall see.

[1] I do sometimes phrase that as "my knees hurt".

[2] I'm not sure my handed-ness goes with the other things I've
listed.  But I have heard that [there's evidence that left-handed
people have shorter life
expectancies](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/feb/05/guardianleaders).

[3] Or grading it, in my case.

[4] At least I hope I'm respected.

[5] That's right.  I should talk to Autumn about whether I would benefit
from any accommodations.

[6] I will admit that it's taken me some time to reach this perspective.
I apologize to those who may have been adversely affected by my strict
policies in the past.

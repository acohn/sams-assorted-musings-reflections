A draft of my 2019-2020 sabbatical proposal
===========================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), academia, things I had to write*

As I get ready for intense work on my digital humanities course design,
I'm trying to clear some paperwork off of my to-do list.  One particularly
important piece of paperwork is my sabbatical request.  Sabbaticals are
one of the great benefits of working in academia; every seven or so
years you get a semester or a year in which you can focus on a scholarly
problem or problems and (mostly) avoid teaching and administrative
responsibilities.  It's something I wish everyone could have.

Of course, sabbaticals are not automatic.  Every institution I've heard
of requires an application for a sabbatical.  At some institutions,
the applications are competitive; only a certain number can be funded
each year.  Grinnell places no limits on the number of sabbaticals
available each year [1].  However, it does require an application to
ensure that faculty have adequately planned for the time away.

I am eligible for leave in 2019-20.  I therefore need to write my proposal.
And now seems to be the right time.  I'd rather do it early than worry
about it at the last moment [2].  So, let's get started.

When is it due?  Let me check [the list of faculty dates to remember](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Lists/FacDates/Deadlines.aspx) [3].  Hmmm ...
it's not due until November 9.  I could put it off.  But I shouldn't.  So
let me check [the guidelines](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Fac_Resources/Sabbatical_Leave_Guidelines.pdf) [4].

Let's see ... there are two sabbatical models.  The "New Model" is for
folks who do not have accrued MAP credits or elected to receive only cash
compensation for their MAP credits.  The "Old Model" is for those who
still want to use their MAP credits.  I fall into the second group [5].
That group's guidelines are as follows.

> Faculty should submit a current CV along with a two-page letter
addressed to the Dean of the College. In such letter, the faculty member
should include the following information:

> a) indicate which semester the leave is preferred; or indicate whether
MAP credits will be used to extend the sabbatical to a full year;

> b) explain the nature of the work to be undertaken during the leave;

> c) specify the location of residence during the proposed leave;

> d) state the scholarly product(s) and/or enhancements to teaching that
are expected to result from the proposed leave.

> e) Include a statement on the accommodation plan for advisees during
the leave period, as discussed and approved by the Department or Program
chair.

How does the old model differ from the new model?  The new model does
not require a computation with MAP credits.  However, the new model
does require "a two-part statement from the Department Chair in which
they address the ways in which the faculty member contributes to student
research as appropriate to the discipline [...] [and] how advisees will
be accommodated".  I'm not sure why we've moved that second responsibility 
from the faculty member to the chair, but I'm guessing that there were
some instances in which they arrangements were not clear.

On a separate note, I'm glad to see that Grinnell faculty are still
permitted to use their sabbatical time to focus on developing course
materials [6]; I was a bit worried that we might be changing our focus
with the change in sabbatical policies.

Now that I have the guidelines, it's time to write [7] the application.

**Indicate which semester the leave is preferred; or indicate whether
MAP credits will be used to extend the sabbatical to a full year.**

*Okay, my case is complicated.  I'm using sabbatical plus accumulated
course releases plus MAP credits.  How complicated?  Let's see.* [8]

I request a full-year sabbatical for the 2019-2020 under the Old
Sabbatical Model as detailed in the Sabbatical Leave Guidelines of August
2018.  In addition to the three-courses sabbatical normally given under
that model, I accumulated one-and-a-half course credits from an overload
in Fall 2017 which Dean Latham asked me to take in either 2018-2019 or
2019-2020.  I will also use the .427 fractional MAP course credit I have
accumulated, giving a total of 4.927 course credits for the full-year.
I realize that this means that my salary for 2019-2020 will be prorated
to 98.54% of the normal amount.  I plan to use my remaining MAP credits
in the years following my sabbatical.

*Hmmm ... I'm cutting my salary by 1.5%.  I'll need to talk to Michelle
about that decision.*

**Explain the nature of the work to be undertaken during the leave.**

*Now we get to the crux of the matter.  I'm planning four projects:
I should put the new CSC 151 materials in a generally-usable form.
I should wrap-up the code-camp work, whatever that means.  I should
rework the mediascheme materials to work only in DrRacket.  And I should
reboot the MIST project.  But how do I discuss and describe those?*

**Specify the location of residence during the proposed leave.**

*I had hoped to go somewhere far away for my sabbatical.  But life has
gotten complex.  And it would be nice to be here for Middle Son's senior
year activities.  So the answer is simple.*

I am likely to spend the majority of my sabbatical in Grinnell.  However,
I do anticipate some extended periods away from campus.

**State the scholarly product(s) and/or enhancements to teaching that are expected to result from the proposed leave.**

*Whoops.  Four projects.  That means four statements.  The new CSC 151
will be a textbook.  The old CSC 151 will be a new set of course materials
(and, ideally, a draft textbook).  The code-camp product will probably
be a paper. However, there are potential issues with that paper.  For
example, we had not anticipated repeat campers.  Both the repeat campers
and the change in instrument complicate data analysis.  There's also a
question of how much co-authorship belongs to the twenty-four-or-so students
who worked on the project.  For the 

**Include a statement on the accommodation plan for advisees during the
leave period, as discussed and approved by the Department or Program
chair.**

*I'll need to discuss this with my chair.  But it's a relatively
straightforward plan.  Note that I would *not* recommend this plan
to early-career faculty; faculty should generally plan to give up
their advisees during leaves.*

I currently have six major or concentration advisees in the class of 2020.
I will continue to advise them.  All are aware that I will be on leave in 
2019-20 and understand that most of their advising will likely be via
electronic mail.  I do not plan to take on many advisees in the class of
2021.  I will follow similar procedures with any I do take.

[1] It does, of course, require that faculty have accumulated sufficient
years of service for the sabbatical time.

[2] Those who know me well may be surprised at the early planning.  I'm
a bit surprised myself.  But I do know that it's good to cross some
medium-size things off the to-do list.

[3] For reasons I don't quite fathom, the list is only available through
GrinCo.

[4] For reasons I don't quite fathom, our sabbatical policies are also
only available through GrinCo.

[5] I see from the guidelines that the "remaining balance of MAP credits [must] be used up as course reductions within 7 years, with 2017-18 as Year 1".
Let's see ... I need to use up my MAP credits by 2023-2024.  That should
not be a problem.

[6] "enhancements to teaching".

[7] Or at least draft.

[8] In case you couldn't tell, I'm using italics for comments about what
I plan to write in each section.

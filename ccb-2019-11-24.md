Cuts, closes, and balances in CS for Spring 2020, revisited
===========================================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), followup*

In [a recent musing](ccb-2019-11-17), I discussed some of the
challenges that Grinnell's CS department was likely to face as we
dealt with the cut, close, and balance stage of Grinnell's registration
process.  While, for the most part, we are able to get through cuts,
closes, and balances in CS relatively smoothly, we did hit one
somewhat large stumbling block.  It's a complicated one and may
require some back story.  The basic issue is that under-enrollments
by a few students (e.g., 15/20) can create as many problems as
over-enrollments (e.g., 25/20) [1].

That seems counter-intuitive, doesn't it?  Here's the thing.  Our
curriculum is a finely balanced thing.  We graduate approximately
sixty CS majors each year.  With eight regular faculty [3,4], we
can offer three sections of each of our required 300-level courses
each year.  That is, we have three sections of CSC 301, _Algorithm
Analysis_ (capped at 20), three sections of CSC 341, _Automata,
Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity_ (capped at 20), and
three sections of CSC 324/326, _Software Design_ (capped at 16/6,
with an anticipated combined enrollment of 20).  So, if a class is
under-enrolled in one semester, it is likely to be over-enrolled
in a future semester.  To prevent future over-enrollments, we need
to find a way to get more students to take the course now.

Now, things aren't quite that simple.  For example, we encourage
our CS students to study abroad.  Many do.  Some even study abroad
in locations that allow them to take CS courses.  If students are
in such situations, many want to take a course that helps them make
progress in the major.  In those cases, we encourage them to take
a course equivalent to CSC 341, which seems to be most similar from
institution to institution.  We've also had some take CSC 301
equivalents abroad, although the content of those courses varies
more.  And, once in a while, a student identifies a course that we
can consider using as an equivalent to CSC 324.

In addition, “sixty majors each year” is an approximation.  While
our enrollments seem to have stabilized at the size, we might have
a few more or a few less.  If we have a few more, we might need to
over-enroll some of those required 300-level courses a bit.  But
we want to limit over-enrollments.

So then the question becomes: If we have fourteen open slots in CSC
301 and CSC 341 this semester, what obligation do we have to make
sure those slots get filled now so that we don't have fourteen
students we have to find slots for next year?  Or, in colloquial
terms, how much can we kick the can down the road?

Suppose we want to deal with the issue now.  The next question
becomes how we address the issue.  We can gently encourage our
students to take CSC 301 and CSC 341 next semester.  We can identify
students who are able to take the courses next semester, and kick
them out of over-enrolled courses.  But if we kick them out, do we
kick them out of required courses (which they will have the opportunity
to take at another date), or elective courses (which they don't
strictly need to take)?

As I said, it's a difficult issue.  I'm not sure we ever came up with
a definitive solution.  We may be trying a combination of things.  If
you are a CS major, and you can take either CSC 301 or CSC 341 next
semester, I encourage you to do so.

Why did I write this musing?  I share the issue with you [5], in
part, so that you understand the kinds of issues faculty (and
department chairs) can encounter and how seemingly straightforward
situations can have unexpected complexities.

I had also hoped that musing about the issue would lead me to a flash
of insight on how to deal with the issue.  Unfortunately, I have no
good solutions.  But I do remember enjoying games of kick the can when
I was young.

[1] Under-enrollments by many students (e.g., only 5/20 enrolled)
are a different kind of problem.  In many cases, if a course has
fewer than six students, the Dean [2] will cancel the course and
try to shift the faculty member to another course.  Of course,
that's not as easy as it sounds.  It's rare that under-enrollments
and over-enrollments pair naturally.

[2] Or at least the prior Deans.

[3] A regular faculty member is one for which there is an assumption
of continued employment (often predicated upon successful reviews).
If I recall correctly, the majority of regular faculty are either
tenure-line faculty or senior lecturers.

[4] We have eight regular positions if you include the position for 
which we are currently hiring.

[5] Whoever you are.

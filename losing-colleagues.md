Saying goodbye
==============

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), academia, short, maudlin*

When you think about the work life of a faculty member, you probably think
about teaching, research, and administrivia.  You might also think about
mentoring, since it's something a lot of us do.  Today I've been thinking
about another aspect of being a faculty member: saying goodbye.  It's not
something I really thought about when I started.  But goodbyes are a natural
part of academia.  Students graduate in four years [1] and very few stick
around campus [2].  So I get to say goodbye to people who mean a lot to
me every spring [3].  Somewhere in the back of my head, I knew that was
part of the job.  

What I hadn't expected was how often I'd have to say goodbye to valued
colleagues.  In some ways, I've been lucky; CS has been relatively stable.
I've been here twenty-one years.  One faculty member in CS left because
they decided to pursue financial engineering.  Another got lured away
by a really nice academic position.  One is stepping back from teaching,
but is still here for three more years.  Beyond that, we've been stable.

But recently I feel like I've been saying goodbye to more and more
people I value as they move on to other things [4].  We've lost
[a valued colleague in student affairs](andrea-conner) [5], [one of my
close collaborators in the code camps](narren-brown), [one of the folks
who started pointing me toward digital humanities](rachel-schnepper),
a Chief Financial Officer committed to openness [6], a Director of
Communications who shared many of my musical interests [7], an awesome
associate Dean [8], and oh so many more, more than I can hope to list.
We learned at the start of the summer that Dean Latham [9] will be departing
at the end of the 2018-10 academic year.  And I learned yesterday that
[one of my favorite people in communications](adrienne-hardin) is leaving
at the end of this month.

It's hard to say goodbye to all these people who I know made (or make)
Grinnell better.  I'm glad for their new opportunities or new directions
in life, but it's always hard to envision a Grinnell without them.  It
makes me sad.

[1] At least most do.

[2] We hope very few stick around campus.  We want them to go off and 
explore more broadly.

[3] Have I mused about my theory that my students may mean more to me than
I mean to them?  Probably not.  I'm not even sure it's true.

[4] There are also people who've passed away.  I'm not emotionally up to
writing about them at this moment.

[5] Okay, we've lost lots of folks in student affairs.  Losing Andrea is
just particularly hard.

[6] I never did manage a profile of Kate.

[7] Yeah, we argued a lot, too.  But there was mutual respect.

[8] Nope, I never managed to profile Shanna either.

[9] Would Dean Latham let me profile him?  I'm not sure.

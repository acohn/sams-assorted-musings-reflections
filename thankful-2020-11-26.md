This Thanksgiving, I am thankful for so many things.  Perhaps they are the
things I'm thankful for every Thanksgiving.  Perhaps they are the the things
that I am thankful for every day.

* I am thankful that an amazing, wonderful, thoughtful woman chose to
  became my wife.
* I am thankful for the three amazing people that Michelle and I raised
  together.  (You know them as Eldest, Middle, and Youngest.)
* I am thankful that we all have our health and that four out of the
  five of us can work or study from home [1].
* I am thankful to have a job that I find enjoyable and fulfilling, one
  that makes a positive difference to others [2].
* I am thankful for the group of students I have this term.
* Although I miss my parents, my in-laws, my aunts and uncles, my
  grandparents, and more, I am thankful for the time I had with them.
* I am thankful that my grandparents came to this country at a time when
  it was more welcoming to immigrants.  I hope it will again be that
  welcoming.
* I am thankful for art, for music, for literature (high and low), for
  the things that make life worth living.
* I am thankful that I can still find the time to write, if only from
  time to time.
* I am thankful for my friends and colleagues, near and far.
* I am thankful that I can keep learning new things each day.
* I am thankful for the number of things I can be thankful for.

I hope that my readers can also find many things to be thankful for,
today and every day.

[1] I worry about the fifth every day.

[2] Or at least that can make a positive difference to others.

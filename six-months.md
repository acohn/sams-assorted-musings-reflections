Six months of daily essays
==========================

* Some technical writing.
* Needed to add some non-technical essays.
* Lots of multi-essay days.
* Anticipated daily technical essays.  But there was a period in which the
  non-technical essays got in the way (or at the work associated with the
  non-technical essays got in the way).
* Wrote an essay about editing.  I'm not sure what I learned, other than that,
  incredibly enough, some of my readers do think I need to edit more.
* Passed 200 essays without much fanfare (at least on my part).
* Got most of them out at a reasonable hour (before 9 p.m.).

Doing it yourself
=================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

A few months ago [1], I managed to break the passenger side-view mirror on
my minivan.  While backing into the garage late at night, I misjudged the
right side and hit the tip of the mirror on the side of the garage.
In most cases in which that happens, the mirror simply snaps backward.
But I hit it "just right", and the case shattered and the mirror broke
[2].  It was still usable, but not a solid piece any more.

My experience with our local body shop is that side-view mirrors cost
an unreasonable amount to fix [3].  So I looked on the InterWeb.
It looked comparatively straightforward to replace a side-view mirror.
And aftermarket side-view mirrors are comparatively cheap.  So I
ordered one.

But then things got busy [4].  And I worried about what would happen when
the process didn't go as smoothly as it looked.  While I had complete
faith that I could unscrew the mirror from the outside, I had less faith
about opening up the inside of the minivan to connect the wiring harness.
So I didn't want to try anything without a four-hour free period.  Those
were and are hard for me to find.

And so I've had a usable but ugly side-view mirror for way too long.
It's caused some problems.  For example, the rest of my family was not
happy driving with a broken side-view mirror.  Once or twice, the
duct tape stopped holding the mirror together and it would flap on the
side of the car until I pulled over and re-taped it.

Michelle finally convinced me that it was time to either fix
it or bring it in for repairs.  After [my experience with the
ceiling fan](ceiling-fan), I should have decided to bring
it in for repairs.  But, well, I'm an eternal optimist.
So I convinced middle son to help.  We watched [a helpful
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldjeQsnAJ9M&t=652s) and then we
got started.

Taking the mirror off was as easy as they suggested.  All I needed to do
was pop off a plastic cover and then unscrew three screws with fun tips.
I was happy to be to find that I actually had all of the tools I needed,
including a fairly strange six-pointed screwdriver tip.

On the other hand, the interior work was not quite as presented.
The video suggested that you can just pop off some interior trim.
We discovered that there was a handle whose screws also held the trim
in place.  It wasn't hard to unscrew them, but it made us worry about
the other steps.  However, we were pleasantly surprised to realize that
it was actually *easier* to reach the wiring harness than we expected.
By popping off a piece of trim on the driver's side, we were able to pull
off the dashboard and easily reach the harness.  Michelle was amused to
see the dash sitting on the lawn [5].

Putting everything back together wasn't trivial, but it was
straightforward.  As the video suggested, the foam was thicker in the
new mirror than the old, which made it a little harder to screw in [6].
In the end, we got the mirror in place in under an hour.  It's nice
to know that there are things I can do myself, least with the help of
my family.

Postscript: Michelle tells me that she was expecting more failures,
throwing of tools, and swearing.  Sorry, Micki!

[1] To be honest, "a few months ago" is a bit of an understatement.  It 
was probably last fall.  It may have even been last summer.

[2] I don't want to think about the seven years of bad luck.

[3] $600 or so, if I recall correctly.

[4] Long-time readers may recall that I was teaching 4.5 courses in
the fall.

[5] She'd pulled up a chair; I think she was looking forward to 
more amusing things than that. 

[6] As the video suggested, the housing on the mirror is shinier than
the nearby exterior trim.

Essay #3 was about Grinnell's relationship with Posse.  
I have now learned that the situation is even more complex than I thought,
and my knowledge is clearly incomplete.  I remain frustrated by many
issues in the situation, but I don't think it's appropriate to keep my
essay up.

Essay #102 was about a 'blog post by Doug Cutchins.
Doug has taken down his post.  I think it is appropriate that I also
take down my response.

Essay #142 was about Web accessibility, focusing on a particular Web site.
My critiques, while accurate, were not appropriate, particularly given
that the people building the site were doing so with the best intentions.
I will likely address some of the details of that essay in a future essay.

This fall, some faculty realized that the contracts we received and
the _Faculty Handbook_ are a bit contradictory.  I [wrote about the
topic earlier](faculty-contracts-2019-10-22).  As I noted, while our
contract notes that "The rules and regulations concerning the Faculty
as set out in the Bylaws of the Trustees and the Faculty Handbook
are hereby referred to and by reference are made a part hereof" [1],
the _Handbook_ says "The Faculty Handbook, while dealing with
employment policies and procedures, is not intended to provide any
assurance of continued employment and should in no way be construed
as an employment contract".

How do we reconcile those two issues?  Dean Harris had indicated that
she would get guidance from College Counsel over winter break, but her
report back at the first faculty meeting of Spring was vague.  I
thought the reconciliation was simple; the _Handbook_ is not intended
as a contract by itself but becomes one when included by reference
in our contracts.  I wonder why Counsel [3] didn't suggest that.  Oh well.

The _Faculty Handbook_ needed rewriting in any case.  I recall
starting to go through it with some expert colleagues last summer
and the group finding a wide variety of issues to deal with.  There's
also the broader issue of non-inclusive [4] language in the _Handbook_,
primarily a failure to acknowledge anything beyond the gender binary.
The College is getting better at inclusive language and the _Handbook_
should follow that trend.

But now the rewrite is going to be getting more complex.  I think
I heard Dean Harris suggest that we're going to separate the
_Handbook_ into two (or more) parts: The part that is mostly
contractual and the part that is more about the organization of the
faculty.  I assume that we'll also have the appendices, which aren't
strictly part of the _Handbook_ but which provide valuable [5]
information.  It makes sense to separate it.  For example, the
Trustees have been trying to reduce the time they spend reviewing
changes to the _Handbook_ the faculty make.  Presumably, if we split
it, they would only need to look at the contractual section, making
everyone's lives easier.

But separating the _Handbook_ will be difficult.  You might think
that most aspects of faculty governance belong in the organizational
section.  But I'm not sure that that can happen.  Consider, for
example, our tenure processes.  Those are almost certainly contractual.
But they mention the Personnel Committee.  So that aspect of faculty
organization needs to be in the contractual section.  And, of course,
Executive Council sets some salaries.  I suppose that also belongs
in the contractual section, even though many aspects of our salary
process don't.

What about aspects of shared governance?  That's not so much a
contract between an individual faculty member and the College (or
the Trustees) as it is a contract between the faculty as a whole
and the College (or the Trustees).  How do we deal with those issues?
I'm not sure.  They need to be somewhere.

Then there's the issue of faculty resolutions that appear only in
the minutes of faculty meetings, but should nonetheless be binding.
I think the "splitting" approach might be a way to ensure that these
resolutions appear in the _Handbook_ directly, although just in
the organization section.

The approach might also help with the current trend of moving things
out of the _Handbook_ and into policies maintained by the Dean's
office.  The problem with that trend is that the policies can change
without faculty input.  I don't think anyone is trying to undermine
shared governance by changing the non-handbook policies without
broad consultation, but the decision as to who gets to change what
is something that needs more clarification.

I appreciate that we will be involving College Counsel in all of
these activities.  But I'm also a bit worried.  Counsel represents
the Trustees and the Administration, not the faculty.  Does that
mean that we need Faculty Counsel, too?  And can we get the College
to pay for that Counsel?  I don't know.

Then there's the whole issue of the _Staff Handbook_ or, as it
should be called, the _Employee Handbook_ [6] since many parts of
it apply to faculty as well as staff.  Unfortunately, updating the
_Staff Handbook_ seems to be something that's taking a long time.
After that, someone is going to have to carefully indicate what
parts deal with the employees we call "faculty" and the employees
we call "staff".  I recall being surprised to discover that something
that is listed as a benefit in the _Staff Handbook_ did not apply
to faculty and being told "We'll work on clarifying that issue." Of
course, that was seven or more years ago.  Oh well.

But it does strike me that if the College is investing in updating
the _Faculty Handbook_, it should invest equally in the _Staff
Handbook_.  That is, if we're setting up a working group that is
supposed to be working on the _Faculty Handbook_ half-time for a
month, or full-time for a week, or something like that, we should
also set up (and compensate) a working group for the _Staff Handbook_.

I wonder whether I'll be allowed to contribute [7] to either process.

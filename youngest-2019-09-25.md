Sending my youngest off to college
==================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

I've been fortunate.  Many parents have to say goodbye to their children
when they head off to college in another state.  Eldest and Middle decided
to stay close by.  So I got to spend another four years seeing each of
them regularly.  That clearly made my life happier.

Youngest has (appropriately) decided to go far away for college.  I think
it's the right decision, but his absence from the house is palpable.  Here
are some things I've noticed that I miss.

* "Hello, Father".  Eldest calls me "Dadest".  Middle calls me "Doctor
  Professor Rebelsky the 2nd" [1,2].  Michelle calls me "Sam" or "SamR".
  Only Youngest seems to prefer to refer to me as "Father".
* The sound of him practicing piano in the family room.
* Tne lack of sound as he practices piano on the electric piano [4].
* The eyeglass cleaning cloths that gather throughout the house, particularly
  by the washing machine.  I now keep one or two with me.
* The water bottles that appear and disappear throughout the house.
* The regular comments on issues of language and grammar.  Fortunately,
  I have Middle around to make some comments.
* The random tech comments.  Right before he left, he talked to me about 
  the program he was writing to interact with the electric piano and
  what he'd learned about MIDI commands for that piano.  He also set up
  a database for our board games, but has not yet given me write/edit access.

[1] Or sometimes just "Dad".

[2] My mother is the first Doctor Professor Rebelsky.  Michelle is the
third.  There's some debate as to who will be number four, five, and
six [3].

[3] After all, a spouse could be one of those.

[4] He tends to use headphones.

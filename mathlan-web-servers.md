The MathLAN web servers
=======================

*Topics/tags: [rants](index-rants), [broken record](broken-record), the Web, short?*

With Communications and ITS having abandoned their responsibility to provide
a public resource for students, faculty, and staff to publish Web pages [1],
the "MathLAN web servers", `www.math.grinnell.edu` and `www.cs.grinnell.edu`,
remain the primary resources the College provides.  Hence, I reacted with
some concern when I heard that someone in ITS let slip that the Web
Governance Committee might be setting policies that limited our use of 
those Web servers [2].  I worried, particularly given that the rumor
mill suggests that both last year and this year, the proposed meeting
times of the Web Governance Committee would not permit all three faculty
members on the committee to attend [3,4].  So I dropped a polite note
to my faculty reps [5].  After providing some context for my question,
I asked the following.

> How small or large is the possibility that the Web governance committee
may decide that we may not be able to keep the MathLAN Web server?
Or is the plan to limit what's on it?  I'll note that www.cs.grinnell.edu
(well, www.math.grin.edu) is the oldest Web server on campus and many
of us have been putting our materials on the server for more than twenty
years. Can you share any more backstory?

Our faculty reps, are both thoughtful and tolerant, so they asked me to
write a bit more about what I value and what aspects of those servers
were appropriate to preserve.  Here's my initial response.

> The most important thing to preserve is a venue for freedom of public expression by College faculty, staff, and students. That should be a core institutional value and our Web policies should reflect it.

> Even if Grinnell decides to compromise on that issue, we should continue to have a place for public course Web sites.  Such sites serve as a form of Open Educational Resources and the faculty did vote to support Open initiatives.  They also serve as a resource for other faculty at this institution; I can't think of a time that I taught a course that I didn't look at a colleague's Web site for ideas.

> Personally, I would prefer that we have a way to maintain the current URLs.  First, URLs are supposed to be stable; links from elsewhere on the Web should continue to work.  In addition, many MathLAN pages have clearly developed a positive "reputation" in Google's PageRank algorithm and it would be a shame to lose that.

> I also use the MathLAN Web server as a resource for teaching students to develop Web pages in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (rather than using a fancy UI).  That doesn't have to be part of MathLAN (although it's convenient to have it as such), but such a resource needs to continue to exist.  I know some colleagues use it to teach students to write database-backed sites; that's also an important characteristic, but it does not have to be on MathLAN.

That's a remarkably concise note from me.  Looking back, are there other
things I seem to have missed ...?

[1] Yes, it's a real responsibility.  Grinnell's [Academic Computer Use
Policies](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/its/policies/academic-computer-usage) clearly state that

> Grinnell College supports the free expression and exchange of ideas and opinions and hopes that users of its computer systems will actively explore the possibilities of electronic publication on the World Wide Web. The College encourages students, faculty, and staff to develop and publish WWW pages through its servers (www.grinnell.edu and www.math.grin.edu). 

[2] More precisely, it was reported that "thereâ€™s some small possibility
that the web governance committee may have a say as to whether we can
keep the department and personal pages".

[3] Amazingly enough, faculty members have classes to teach.  I don't think
it's unreasonable to expect people scheduling meetings that are supposed
to include faculty members to avoid times those faculty are teaching.

[4] It is just a rumor.  However, I heard it from multiple people, all
of whom should reasonably have been "in the know".

[5] "Polite" is contextual.  I think it was a reasonably polite note
for someone who has dealt with five years of stonewalling by ITS and
Communications about Web policies.

Modeling Many (CS) Majors (Fall 2016)
=====================================

*Reflections written in preparation for and in response to a meeting
with the Dean.*

As chair of the computer science department, I try to be proactive.
I look for likely problems, and try to put things in place to stave
off those problems.  It probably comes from my training as a computer
scientist and a computer programmer.  I try to write robust code [1],
and writing robust code means that you try to predict things that might
happen, including edge and corner cases.

Last semester, I looked at the number of students taking CSC 161, the
second course in the CS major, and I said to myself "We won't be able to
get by with only one section each of CSC 207 [2] and MAT/CSC 208 [3]."
(And no, I did not add endnotes when talking to myself.)  I worked with
the Dean and my awesome colleagues in Mathematics, and we were able to
work out a plan that gave us two sections of CSC 207 and two sections
of MAT/CSC 208.  And it was good that we did.  The two sections of CSC 207
have 52 students between them.  The two sections of MAT/CSC 208 have 41
students between them.  

But that brings us to the next potential problem.  If we include the
32 students taking CSC 207 this fall, we have 84 students taking CSC
207 this year.  And, since CSC 207 is the third course in the CS major,
it's a pretty good bet that many of them are thinking of being CS majors.
How does one figure that out?  I'm going to have my faculty ask folks
at the start of next semester.  But until then, it's probably a good idea
to model.

Fortunately, our Office of Analytic Support and Institutional Research
(OASIR) is helpful in providing us with data.  As best as I can tell,
the number of graduates we have in any given year is about 2/3 the size
of the CSC 207 class two years previous.  (I don't have quite the right
data, but I think it's pretty close.)  That suggests that we'll have
over fifty majors in the class of 2019, in addition to the thirty-eight
in the class of 2017 and the thirty-eight currently declared in the
class of 2018.  That's a scary number.  The Registrar's office tells
me that no department has had that many majors in a single class year.
Econ currently has 48 in the class of 2017 and 48 in the class of 2018,
which I also think are historical highs.

So I asked OASIR to do the modeling themselves.  There aren't really
historical precedents for our growth, so it's hard.  As far as I can
tell, they anticipate between 40 and 55 CS majors in the class of 2019
and between 45 and 60 in the class of 2020.  Those are big ranges.

So I did the next best thing.  I made a list of all of the second-year
students who have already declared a CS major, and all the second- and
third-year students still likely to declare a CS major.  I think we'll
get six more CS majors from the class of 2018.  We have twelve declared
in the class of 2019, and I count forty more who are likely to declare.
That's forty-four majors in the class of 2018 and fifty-two [4] in the
class of 2019.

These are scary numbers.  Really scary numbers.  Why?  Well, our
curriculum was originally designed for about fifteen to twenty majors
per year.  Our new tenure-line position lets us offer two sections per
year of our required upper-level courses [5].  That basically allows us
to cover up to about forty majors per year, since some upper-level
courses are capped at twenty, and we would like to allow some students
to take both CSC 211 and CSC 213.  Once we go over forty, we're screwed
[6].  At that point, we probably need to offer three sections per year
of CSC 321/22 (Software Design), three sections per year of CSC 301
(Algorithm Analysis), three sections per year of CSC 341 (Automata, Formal
Languages, and Computational Complexity; most folks call this "Theory),
two sections per year of CSC 213 (Operating Systems, if you haven't
been paying attention), and, ideally, CSC 211 (Computer Architecture).
Oh yeah; the Registrar wants us to offer another section of CSC 151
(Functional Problem Solving, our introductory course.

I'm not sure what the solution is.  If I were on Executive Council, I'm
not sure that I'd approve another tenure-line position for CS.  As we've
seen, it's a [zero-sum game](faculty-lines.html), and CS has just received
a new tenure-line position.  There's also no guarantee that the increase
in student interest is permanent.  But it's not clear that it's possible
to hire a term position in CS; the number of tenure-track positions far
outstrips the number of folks who want positions in academia.  I know
that many institutions failed to fill tenure-track slots last year.

Sample schedule.

Effects on advising.  Recommendations?

---

[1] No laughing!

[2] Algorithms and Object-Oriented Design, the third course in the CS
major.

[3] Discrete structures, one alternative for our core requirement in
mathematics.

[4] One deck!

[5] Okay, we're only offering one section of CSC 211, Architecture,
and CSC 213, Operating Systems per year.  But we only require one of
the two.

[6] More precisely, our students are screwed.

Whoops
======

*Topics/tags: [On musing](index-on-writing), [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

It's the last day of the month.  On the last day of the month, I typically
write [a long musing in which I reflect on what I mused about during the
month and what I learned about writing](index-on-writing).  And I was planning
to do so.  But for some reason, I convinced myself that *tomorrow* was the
last day of April, not today.

How does that saying go?  "Thirty days hath September, April, June, and
November" [1].  What month is it?  April?  Whoops.

I have a variety of notes about what I want to write about this month.
But they are incomplete and likely incorrect in places [2].  It usually
takes a bit more than an hour to turn those assorted notes into a coherent
musing [3].  I'm [behind on sleep](sleepless-cycles) and don't really
have that hour tonight.

I apologize, dear reader.  It's the end of the month and all you get is
this rambly short musing [4].  Don't worry, though.  I'll pretend that May
1 is the last day of the month.

Back tomorrow.

[1] There's also a part about February, but I think it gets too long when
you start to handle the century and millenium issues.

[2] For those who care, here are the *unedited* notes.

> * Start adding topics/tags at the top.
> * Added Hypothes.is.  Broke things.
> * Wrote a new introduction (?, I hope).  About a month later than I'd
  planned.
> * Status of list of forthcoming musings (rearranged, I hope; changes to
  total number?  Added potential tags?)
> * When I had to talk about CSC 321/22 recently, it was helpful to have
  spent some time writing about it.  I think it made me more articulate.
  (Of course, I also talk about CSC 321/22 a lot.  So perhaps not.)
> * Tried planning a week in advance.  Quickly got disrupted.  Nights
  in which I needed short musings.  One or two musings that needed
  external approval (those are rare).
> * Writing the long rant on [Getting requirements
  wrong](getting-requirements-wrong) ended up being a useful exercise.
  I explained to myself why I care about these issues.  I learned that we've
  explicitly exempted some majors from the department limit.  I began to
  think about the issue for Math/Stats.  Of course, when I started writing
  it, I thought it would be a short rant.
> * Kept trying to write short musings.  But the short musings kept ending
  up being long musings.  Bleh.
> * Partially for that reason, most musings still don't get posted until 
  10 p.m.  But I did get one out before 7:00 p.m. one day.  That's one
  that I just felt I needed to write.  (Which one was it?  Damn.  Oh,
  it was the mixed messages one.)
> * Reached 600 musings.  Chose that number to try to restart a long-defunct
  series of "Grinnellians you should know (or know about)".  I remember
  why I wrote them.  They make me feel good.  I think they make other
  people feel good.  They shouldn't make anyone feel bad.  That's 
  definitely a net positive.  I have a few more in the "soon" queue, but
  seventeen days have passed and I haven't made it to any yet.
> * Technical readers are submitting pull requests.
> * Realized that I don't remember what I write.  After yet another
  discussion in which people disparaged double majors, I had sketched 
  a paragraph about them.  A few days later, I realized that I'd already
  mused about the subject.  I have new things to say (e.g., that eight-course
  majors make double majors much easier), but I think I'll put it off
  a bit longer.

[3] "Coherent" may be generous for the end-of-month musings.

[4] Plus all of the assorted notes, so that you can discover a bit
more of what happens behind the scenes.

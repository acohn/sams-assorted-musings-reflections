Conducting a salary review
==========================

*Topics/tags: [Overcommitment](index-overcommitment)*

As long-time readers may recall, a few years ago I wrote a [series of
musings](index-salary-reviews) in which I discussed [1] [Grinnell's process
for post-tenure salary reviews](triennial-salary-reviews) and then presented
drafts of my various statements for the review.

Normally, the chair of the department conducts the salary review.
This year, my chair is up for review.  That means someone else has
to do it.  I'm on sabbatical.  I had hoped that would mean that I
could avoid doing the review.  But I'm the only other tenured member
of the CS department, and it's not clear that someone outside the
department can appropriately assess teaching or scholarship in the
department, nor discuss the particular complexities we've faced
over the past few years.  So writing the review fell to me. 

No, I'm not going to put Jerod's review in a public document.  But
I thought I might write a bit about the process and the time involved.
I believe I asked a colleague whether or not I should agree to write
the review and they said something like, "It doesn't take that much
time."  

I must admit that I likely approached the review differently than
some other folks do [2].  Salary reviews determine your salary for
the next three years [3] so I think they deserve some care and
attention.

So, how much time did I spend on the review?  

For the review, we are supposed to attend between one and three classes.
I attended three.  As I said, I think reviews deserve some care and
attention.  In general, the first time you attend a class, the class
behaves differently because there's someone else in the room.  Attending
a second class helps ameliorate that effect.  So I wanted to attend at
least two classes.  But Jerod is only teaching CSC 211 this semester,
and CSC 211 has both "normal" class sessions and lab sessions.  So I wanted
to attend both.  I believe I spent five hours in class, more or less.

I had to read the instructions from the Dean's office.  I had two
documents to read: a two-and-a-half-page document entitled _Guidelines
for Three-Year Salary Reviews_, which had the document name "Three-Year
Salary Reviews, 19-20.pdf", and a five-page document entitled
_Faculty Salary Rubric_, which had the document name "Fac Review
Guidelns 2019-2020.docx.pdf" [4].  I had thought that we were
supposed to vote on the rubric, but I don't recall that vote
happening yet [6].  I also had a link to follow but that led me to
one of those documents.  Let's say between fifteen and thirty minutes
to read and understand the documents [8].

The instructions say that,

> The department chair or designated reviewer, after meeting with the colleague to discuss accomplishments and goals set forth in the Faculty Salary Review form, will provide comments as indicated on the form.  

I believe it took me about thirty minutes to read Jerod's statements
and between fifteen and thirty minutes to put together notes for
things to talk about.  I didn't time our meeting [9], but I believe
I spent about forty-five minutes talking through things from the
class and the form.

Unfortunately, it appears that I had not made a sufficiently detailed
list, so I spent another fifteen to thirty minutes doing Web searches
for various things, such as the acceptance rate for ICDAR 2017
(12.7%) and the policies for creating Significant Bit talks.

I spent an hour or so on emails related to the process.  It's amazing
how administrivia creeps into everything we do.

I spent about an hour looking at Jerod's EOCE scores and comments
[10].  I did not make the detailed notes that I would for, say, a
tenure review.  Still, I considered it important to see how the
things I saw in class related to things students said about his
teaching in general.

Writing the first draft of my three sets of comments took about two
hours.  I thought it would be less.  It may have been a bit more.
Why so long?  There were a lot of issues to discuss and I tried to
be relatively concise [11].  I've currently written 773 words on
teaching, 359 on scholarship, and 407 on service.  That's about
three single-spaced pages, six double-spaced pages, or slightly
longer than this musing [12].  Three pages in two hours is slightly
slower than my standard spewing rate of one page every thirty minutes,
but I'd expect a review of this form to take a bit longer.

Did I need to write that much?  I'm not sure.  I'd like to be able
to assume that the Salary Committee knows about my department and
my discipline, such as the complexities of having only two tenured
faculty members and multiple tenure-line faculty and visitors.
However, given my interactions with some folks in Administration,
it feels like I should spell things out.

I haven't done my final edits yet, and I owe it to the Faculty
Salary Committee to do those edits.  Balancing appropriate details
with concision will be hard.  Let's assume that I'll spend between
thirty minutes and an hour on that task.

Where does that leave us?  It seems like I spent between 11.5 and
12.75 hours on this process.  Is that a lot?  It means that the
salary review was not a trivial task, but it's not meant to be.

I can't recall if I logged how much time writing up my own salary
review form took two years ago.  I'm guessing that the time was
similar.  Let's hope that the Salary Committee is much more efficient,
particularly since they have forty or fifty of these to read, score,
and respond to.

[1] And ranted about

[2] That shouldn't be surprising; I approach many things differently.

[3] More precisely, salary reviews help determine your merit score,
your merit score determines your annual raises, and your annual raises
along with your current salary determine your future salary.

[4] Why does the file name for the rubric use "guidelines" [5] and the
guidelines document not use the term?  I have no idea.  

[5] Or, more precisely, "Guidelns".

[6] There's no _Handbook_ language that suggests that the faculty have
to approve the salary review rubric.  If I recall correctly, in
past years, the Faculty Salary Committee [7] generally wrote them
on their own.

[7] Or is that Faculty Budget Committee?

[8] I was good.  I didn't go and look for additional information on
practices in past years, at least not at this point.

[9] I didn't time any of this stuff.

[10] For this process, the Salary Committee only gets the responses
for questions 2 ("The instructor helped me to understand the subject
matter of the course") and 6 ("I learned a lot in this course").
The Review Chair gets a copy of the scores that the Salary Committee
will get.  Last year, we voted to only use those data to identify
outliers.  But no one gave me the College-wide distributions, so it's
hard to tell whether or not something is an outlier [11].  The Department 
Chair normally has the full end-of-course evaluations, and the comments
and other scores for those evaluations are therefore available to them.

[11] I did not succeed.  I'll likely do another round or two of editing
before I submit.

[12] Apologies to the Faculty Salary Committee.  I'll definitely try
to trim.

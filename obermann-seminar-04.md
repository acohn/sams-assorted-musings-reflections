Reflecting on the CSC 151 project at my fourth Obermann seminar
===============================================================

*Topics/tags: [CSC 151](index-151), teaching, academia 

Every two weeks or so, the Obermann Fellows meet to discuss
work in progress at a bi-weekly "seminar".  As [I mentioned
recently](obermann-note-2018-10-29), I decided to use my second
presentation as an opportunity to get feedback from a very
different group of faculty about [a possible final project for the
new digital humanities version of CSC 151](fundhum-project-00).
Preparing that project description also encouraged me to think
about [an alternative](fundhum-project-01) and to develop a
[rubric](fundhum-project-rubric-00) for the project.  I'm recording some
of my observations in this musing so that I don't forget them [1].

To provide some context for the material, I had written [an introductory
letter](obermann-note-2018-10-29) that ended up being about two pages
long.  As I prepared for the meeting and had a hallway conversation with
one of the Fellows, I realized that I needed a bit more background.  So,
in introducing the discussion, I talked about the tight restrictions on
the old MediaScheme project ("your procedure takes exactly three integer
arguments, two of which are width and height; it must scale and stretch
precisely"), the comparatively loose restrictions on the data science
project ("find an interesting data set and do something with it"), and
some of the data sets that the data science students came up with (alcohol
sales in Iowa, incarceration data, cancer data with predictions, poems).

Given the way I framed the discussion, much of our initial discussion
was on the two models.  The consensus seemed to be that the more focused
version of the project was more appropriate.  However, some raised the
concern that the number of different projects would be limited.  I'm not
that worried; I'm hopeful that one of the outcomes is that the students
realize how many different things that you can do with the same archive.
Some may write programs that visualize parts of the archive.  Some may
write programs that categorize items in the archive.  Some may write
programs that summarize items in the archive.  Some may use the archive
as a source for generating new material [2].  And, as I tried to suggest
in the writeup, each kind of programs admits many different approaches.
One can visualize connections in the abstract or locations on a map.
Different groups will likely choose different categories and different
ways to categories.  "Summarize" can be interpreted in many different
ways.  Or at least that's my fantasy.

Still, there there were some very good suggestions about handling topic
that I need to consider for fully.  For example, it was suggested that
even if I make "work on *this archive* with *this audience*" the default,
but also allow students to choose more broadly, "Those who are willing to
spend extra effort can choose their own archive but will need to discuss
that archive with me first."  Another suggestion was that I give them
two or three very different options, so that they would be more likely
to find one of the archives of interest [3].  I like those as long-term
suggestions.  However, for the first offering, my inclination is to
work with a single archive, preferably one that has a real audience.
If I'm providing the archive, I need to spend more time getting it
into the right shape (or at least understanding it), which takes time.
A uniform archive also helps support uniform grading.  And, that way, I
can bring a real "client" to the class.  Fortunately, my fellow Grinnell
Digital Bridges fellow has an archive that they volunteered to let us use.
We need to talk more [4].

I got one very nice suggestion for the times that I am picking the data 
set myself, or giving students much more free option, and that's to use
[ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/).  The Fellow who suggested
that resource did note that it's way too easy to lose yourself in those
data.  But it does strike me that ICPSR can provide some interesting
opportunities for a humanistic approach to social-sciency data [5].

We spent some time discussing the length of the assignment and
related issues.  "If I count right, each student spends ten hours
over two weeks on this.  How much can they really accomplish in that
amount of time?"  I said that while that is, indeed, a worry, I worry
more about student workload.  If we assume each four-credit course is
twelve hours per week, we are already asking students to spend 48 hous
per week on their classwork, and that does not count their work time or
their extracurriculars.  If I have students in class for four hours per
week, give three thirty-minute readings per week, expect them to attend
a one-hour mentor session, and give them three ten-minute lab writeups,
that leaves five hours per week for the project.  I was glad to have my
Grinnell colleague note that "Wellness is a real concern at Grinnell" [6].

I'm not sure where in the conversation it was, but we also ended up
talking about preregistration and advising at Grinnell, primarily in
terms of the workload.  I mentioned my forty advisees.  My Grinnell
colleague mentioned that many of their advisees ask for hour-long
preregistration appointments [7].  That led to a comment on the order
of "I'm often envious of what you have at Grinnell [8]

Where was I?  Oh, yes.  What can students do in ten hours?  A whole lot,
it seems.  More precisely, I think I suggested that,

> It depends a lot on the student or group.  Some groups will take a
prior homework assignment and extend it for this new archive.  Some will
be more ambitious and start something new from scratch.  And, I admit,
some will get caught up enough in the project that they will spend
significantly more than five hours per week on the project.

More generally,

More/earlier projects to get design feedback.

What data are not collected?

Multiple projects?

"Archive" as a term.

Lots of good suggestions.  

"Like all that you do, it's warm and inviting."  It appears that I should
share some of my rants with them.  Or maybe those are warm (that is,
only somewhat heated) and inviting ("come rant with me"), too.
Structure to get more feedback on, say design issues, or potential
problems with the data.

My idea: Must use X, Y, and Z.  (E.g., recursion.)  Need to update
the rubric.

Challenge of larger classes/benefits of smaller classes.

Ability to think carefully about teaching.  (or maybe appreciation that
I think so carefully about what I do)

---

[1] I'll admit that I had more fun paricipating in a discussion of a
colleague's work; I've written about that discussion in [a separate
musing](obermann-seminar-04-film).

[2] That last approach may not be appropriate for every archive.

[3] E.g., "You can choose a collection of translations of _Beowulf_,
this archive of materials relating to mental health advocacy, or Rocky
Horror FanFic."

[4] I suppose we could apply for a Faculty-Faculty Tutorial to work
out the details.  However, I'm not sure that either of us have time
for a Faculty-Faculty Tutorial.

[5] Or, more precisely, a computationally supported humanistic approach
to social-sciencey data.

[6] Our students are very fortunate to have a wide variety of people
who advocate for wellness, who encourage students to pursue healthier
approaches, and who support them as they adopt those approaches.  Still,
wellness remains a major concern for students, faculty, and staff.  I
expect that our new Wellness Director (or whatever we're calling the
position) will also make a positive difference.

[7] While I have many advisees who ask for thirty minutes, I can't recall
any who started out asking for an hour appointment.  There are some who
need multiple appointments, but we usually start with fifteen or thirty
minutes.  I also do enough casual advising and four-year planning that,
for many students, preregistration is comparatively easy.

[8] I'm not sure what particular thing that speaker was thinking about.
Most likely, our students.  One of the big themes I heard at the
Digital Bridges was how strong the average Grinnell student seems to be.
We've also talked about the intellectual climate at Grinnell, and the
feeling that most faculty feel like they should understand disciplines
beyond their own.  Or perhaps they were just reflecting on more practical
issues, such as class size or our generous sabbatical policy.

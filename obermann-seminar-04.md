My fourth Obermann seminar
==========================

*Topics/tags: [CSC 151](index-151), teaching, academia 

I had written an introductory letter that ended up being about two
pages long.  Stil, I ended up giving more background.
I talked about the tight restrictions on the old
MediaScheme project ("your procedure takes exactly three integer
arguments, two of which are width and height; it must scale and
stretch precisely"), the comparatively loose restrictions on
the data science project ("find an interesting data set and do
something with it"), and some of the data sets that the data
science students came up with (alcohol sales in Iowa, incarceration
data, cancer data with predictions, poems).

Discussed length.  "Can they do anything substantial in ten hours per
person?"  (Tammy noted wellness.)  Discussed models.  Learned about new
possible data sets.  Talked about advising during registration.  ("Often
I hear about what you do at Grinnell and I'm envious.  It's good to know
that there are downsides, too."  Not that advising is a downside, but it's
really time consuming.)  "Archive" as a term.

Lots of good suggestions.  

"Like all that you do, it's warm and inviting."  It appears that I should
share some of my rants with them.  Or maybe those are warm (that is,
only somewhat heated) and inviting ("come rant with me"), too.
Structure to get more feedback on, say design issues, or potential
problems with the data.

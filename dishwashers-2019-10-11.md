Dishwashers
===========

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

Recently, my family was visiting some of my mother's old friends.
At some point in our conversation, one of them mentioned that when
I was a young adult, I said something to them like,

> Why are you rinsing your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher?
Isn't that the whole point of a dishwasher?

Michelle almost spit out whatever was in her mouth [1] and broke up
laughing.  Why?  Because, at our house, I'm the one who rinses the
plates before I put them in the dishwasher.  Why do I do that?  My
experience is that the dishwasher works better if you don't, say,
allow large globs of ketchup to drip off plates into it.  Perhaps
I'm wrong.  I suppose we could run experiments, but I'm too lazy.

In addition to rinsing plates, I also try to arrange the silverware
and plates so that like is next to like.  For the plates, I find it
allows us to pack the dishwasher more efficiently.  For the silverware,
I just think it's neater.  I may be the only one in the family who feels
that way [2].

Postscript: I'd swear there's a [Keith Knight](http://www.kchronicles.com/)
comic about loading dishwashers.  However, I've failed to find it.

Postscript: Maybe we should make one of Keith Knight's collections
the next common read at Grinnell.  Then we could bring him to campus
to give his ["Red, White, Black & Blue: Racial Illiteracy in the
U.S." slideshow](http://www.kchronicles.com/comic/racially-illiterate/)
to campus.  Or I guess we could do that anyway.

[1] Or she would have, if she'd had anything in her mouth.

[2] I have even been known to rearrange the plates and silverware when
other family members fail to follow my preferred system.

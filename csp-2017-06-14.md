Reading AP CS Principles, Take 3
================================

One of the problematic issues I am observing as I talk to people about the
CS Principles AP (CSP) is that CSP is trying to be too many things to too
many people.  To understand this problem, you may need some background.

As best I understand it, the broad goal of the AP CS Principles course
is to encourage more people and a wider variety of people to consider
computing.  It achieves this goal by providing a broader perspective
on what computing is than AP CS A, which is really a programming class,
and by allowing students to explore areas of interest.

The AP CSP exam approaches this goal with three main components.  There is
the standard multiple-choice component that you would expect to see in any
AP exam.  That component is graded by computer.  There is a programming
component, called "Create".  Create differs from the programming
components on the more traditional AP CS exam in multiple ways.  First,
students can write programs about more or less whatever they want and
in whatever language their teacher chose [1].  Second, students complete
the programming assignment in class, rather than during a fixed time for
the AP.  Third, the primary focus in grading the exam is not the program
code [2], but rather a series of short essays about various issues the
code is supposed to represent: some algorithms, a use of abstraction,
the development process, and so on and so forth.  The third component is
an essay (well, really a series of answers to prompts) about an innovation
that involves computing.  The essay includes reflections on positive and
negative impacts of the technology and a reflection on issues pertaining
to security, privacy, or storage [3].  That essay is also accompanied
by an "artifact" (image, digital collage, video, animation, audio,
etc.) that demonstrates that the student can represent the innovation
with more than just text.  As a board member of SIGCAS [4], I particularly
appreciate that students are asked to reflect on technology.  What else?
Oh, the essay, like the code, is written in class, rather than in the
traditional "locked in a room for four hours" AP testing.

That sounds good, doesn't it?  Students do two moderate-sized projects one
of which shows that they understand what computing is and how it impacts
society, the other of which shows that they understand computational
thinking and can put it into practice through a computational artifact.
But I started this musing by noting that I found Principles problematic
because it tries to address too many audiences.  Let's consider what
I see as the primary conflicts.  CS Principles is an AP class, which
means that it should require college-level work.  At the same time,
it's intended to be accessible to a wide variety of teachers, not just
to CS and math faculty.  Further complicating matters are issues of the
"haves" and the "have nots".  Some schools that already had some CS
(such as AP CS A) are treating this as more of an introductory course
for 9th and 10th graders.  Schools that didn't have CS before are less
sure where in the curriculum it should be.  I'm not sure that a typical
9th grader should be earning college credit, but there's certainly an
undercurrent that the course should also be accessible to 9th graders.

How does this conflict come into play?  Primarily in the rubric we use
to assess the exams and the notes that help us interpret that rubric [5].

While I have a high-school student, I don't teach high-school students.
So I can only speak from the perspective of a college faculty member at
a relatively elite college.  Here's what I'd want out of CSP in order
to award academic credit for the course [6].

Some of my expectations are general and belong to both of the two
special tasks.

A college student cites any work that is not their own and that is part
of what they submit.  They cite ideas and facts they have taken from
written sources; images, sounds, videos, and animations that they have
used but not created; and code that they have copied [7].  At Grinnell
[8], students who use materials that others prepared and do not cite
those materials have been academically dishonest and are reported to
our Committee on Academic Standing.  That should not be surprising;
someone who writes an AP Lit or AP US History paper and does not cite
their sources will get a 0 on the task for plagiarism.  The same should
hold for CSP.  Fortunately, my reading of the CSP Guidelines suggests
that plagiarism leads to a 0 on the task.

On an untimed writing task, such as Explore and Create, a college student
uses correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation [9].  I am a bit concerned that
there is no rubric item for grammar and punctuation in either open task.
That concern might be alleviated by a similar disclaimer.  "Submissions
that do not meet reasonable standards for grammar, spelling, and punctuation
will receive a zero for ....."

A college student knows how to follow instructions [10].

Okay, on to the Explore task.

What about the

[1] I'm pretty sure that you can find AP CS courses that use each of
the following languages: Scratch, Alice, C, C#, Snap!, Racket, Javascript,
Python, C, AppInventor, and StarLogo.

[2] After all, you can't expect most readers to know this wide variety of
possible languages.

[3] No, I don't know how the "storage" got added.

[4] Special interest group on Computers and Society.

[5] I will admit that I do not understand the subtle difference between
the rubric and the notes that indicate how it is applied; I would classify
the latter as part of the rubric, but ETS does not.

[6] Grinnell currently gives generic science credit for CSP.  We will
revisit that decision after the new examples and rubric notes are posted
this fall.  Since Principles is in its infancy, I expect that we will be
checking our decision every year or two for the next five or more years.

[7] I would prefer that a student also cite generated code, but that's
a bit complex, even for some college students.

[8] And, I assume, at most schools.

[9] I'm not sure what would be appropriate for students with disabilities;
it would depend on their IEP.  I might also make an exception for an ESL
high-school student.  But once they reach college, I expect students to
follow standards of American English writing.

[10] College students don't always choose to follow instructions, but they
know how to follow them, and they tend to do so on examinations.

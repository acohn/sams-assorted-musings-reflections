Sometimes I just want to quit
=============================

*Screw it.  I tried being positive.  But I don't feel positive.  So
here's an essay that reflects my current state of mind.  It's clear
that I won't get any real work done today until I write it.*

*You may recall [a recent essay](thank-you-01.html) in which I started
with my negative day and ended on a positive note.  You'll probably
find that this essay does the opposite.*

I love teaching at Grinnell.  I love my students, who are, by and large,
smart, committed, multi-talented, genuinely nice people.  I love my
faculty colleagues, who are, by and large, brilliant, thoughtful,
multi-talented people committed to the mission of the institution.
I also love my non-faculty colleagues, who are also by and large,
wonderful, thoughtful, and committed to the mission of the institution.
I love that Grinnell has the resources to support students who could
not otherwise afford a small liberal-arts education.  (William likes to
joke that even with his national merit scholarship and our 90% tuition
reduction for faculty and staff, he still gets less than the average
financial aid award at Grinnell, which was $45K last year.)

I also love the particulars of my job.  I so appreciate that my primary
responsibility is helping students discover the wonder of CS (or of
thinking closely about technology, or of thinking statistically, or just
generally of being a college student).  I really love computer science,
a field which gives me the opportunity to address interesting problems,
to create things that have a function, and to create things that can
change how people work.  I like that, as a faculty member, I have some
control over what I do (or at least when I do it; if I had more control,
I'd work fewer hours).  And seeing what I've helped empowered students
to do just thrills me.  (Knowing that I've also helped to build a
successfully inclusive community of students also thrills me.)  

I love the support that I get from across campus in doing what I do.
I love that I know that when I tell someone about a new teaching
approach, they will not only be supportive, but help me think through
it better.  I love that when I ask for financial support for things
that I think are important (e.g., helping students attend conferences), 
I can often find at least partial support.

Plus, I get paid moderately well.  (Definition of moderately well:
More than something like 90% of the country; less well than at least
one new graduate each year.)  Among other things, that means I can
donate back to the College to support the things I think are important
but that the College can't reasonably support for every department.

Because I am passionate about what I do and about our students,
I complain.  A lot.  A whole lot.  Why?  Because we screw up a lot
at Grinnell.  We screw up on our technology decisions.  We screw up
on how we support (or, more precisely, don't support) our students.
We are incredibly chincey in so many situations.  (I often feel that we
are penny wise and pound foolish.)  I respect most of the people who
make decisions, but boy, we make a lot of crap decisions at Grinnell.

Amazingly, even those frustrations don't deter me.

So, why did I title this "Sometimes I just want to quit"?  Because it's
true.  And I want to quit not because of any of the things mentioned
above, but because I regularly feel that our administration not only
doesn't listen, but also actively interferes with my ability to do my
job successfully.  (And I say this in spite of having great respect for
most of the people in the administration.)  It doesn't help that I don't
feel particularly valued.

Last year (or at least I think it was last year, maybe it was the year
before), we worked on providing better compensation for the work that
Department Chairs do.  In the end, we increased that compensation (from
1/2 course per year to 2 courses every three years).  And that seems good,
at first glance (although most of us think one course per year would be
more reasonable, and that certain departments probably need more release
than others).  But then there's the kicker.  Not all department chairs
can take a course release.  Most frequently, there are too many students
who need courses, and we feel an obligation to make sure those students
get taught.  So, how much do we pay a Chair who can't take a course release
in lieu of that course release?  $7K.  Does that seem like a lot to you?
It's less than what we pay some visitors.  It's less than what I made
teaching one course at Dartmouth as a newly minted Ph.D. in Spring 1993,
more than twenty years ago.  It's insulting.  (I know that we're keeping
it somewhat low to discourage Chairs from making the decision not to take
a course release, but it's still insulting.)

Last year, our awesome, new (comparatively), Dean encouraged the faculty to
endorse the concept of making sure that every Grinnell student has the
opportunity to have a substantial research experience.  In multiple 
discussions, the Dean made it clear that he thought of such experiences
as building upon a substantial amount of learning throughout the 
curriculum (he often referred to them as "capstones") and of requiring
substantial time (in response to my question about a three-week module
in an upper-level course, he suggested that would probably not be enough).

Piling on of workload.

Changing of expectations.

Cheap.  Really cheap.

Cap on number of faculty.

[Okay, that helped.  I'm not going to post this (yet).  I just needed
to get some of the crap out of my system.]

fed up with one's job can be a warning sign, I should note that I have
no intent to commit suicide.*

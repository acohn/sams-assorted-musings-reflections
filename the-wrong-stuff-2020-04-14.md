"Wolfe is a stunt pilot of the sentence." -R.S.

---

Today in _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_, we discussed profiles.  One
of the pieces we read was Tom Wolfe's profile on Chuck Yeager, taken from
_The Right Stuff_.  I'm glad to have read and discussed the work [1].
But Prof. Savarese chose an interesting source for the piece, what seems
to be manual of writing instruction.  I figured it out midway through
the first page when I saw a footnote mark [2].  Now, Wolfe doesn't
make much use of footnotes in his work; in fact, this footnote was
for a comment from the editors (annotators) of the manual.  It was
helpful, I think; at least it guided us to the variety of voices
that Wolfe uses in the masterful opening.

But what's not all that makes the opening paragraph so amazing.  What
makes it amazing is that the sentences are literally [3] falling
apart, foreshadowing what happens to planes when you get close to
Mach 1.  However, the annotators don't tell us that.  In fact, much
of what they tell us is either obvious or lacking.  Consider this
sentence: "Yeager grew up in Hamlin, West Virginia, a town on the
Mud River not far from Nitro, Hurricane, Whirlwind, Salt Rock, Mud,
Sod, Crum, Leet [5], Dollie, Ruth, and Alum Creek."  Now, you know and I
know that Wolfe was doing a lot with that list, playing with the sound
and order of the list of the names, getting us to understand the area,
the weather, the work people do, and more.  But here's what the this
is what the footnote says.

> The list of towns we've never heard of indicates just how far back in 
the hollows Yeager lived.

Really?  That's all you [6] want your students to take out of that?

Here's a "rule of three" sentence that comes soon thereafter.  To
my mind, it does not show off Wolfe's skills [7]: "His brother was
a gas driller (drilling for natural gas in the coalfields), his
older brother was a gas driller, and he would have been a gas driller
had he not enlisted in the Army Air Force at the age of eighteen."

> The first two repetitions of "gas driller" set up the expectation
that Yeager too will become a gas driller, but then Wolfe catches
us by surprise using the third repetition to say that he enlisted
in the army air force instead.  The whole play on words is fun to
read and engages the reader.

I see that I wrote "Are you serious?" next to that footnote.  They
consider that a play on words?  They thought it was surprising?  They
thought it was fun to read?  I feel like we're looking at different
sentences.    And then there's the structure of the sentence.  The
"he" is ambiguous; it could refer to Yeager or Wolfe.  "army air
force" should be capitalized.  And all they're really done in the first
sentence of the footnote is to repeat what Wolfe said.

I tried to ignore the footnotes.  Really, I did.  But my brain is
wired to read footnotes.  So I got to see a variety of wonderful
pairings.

"But to pilots this prehistoric throwback of an airfield became
shrimp heaven! the rat-shack plains of Olympus."

> Linking the rat-shack plains to Mount Olympus shows us its exalted
status among the hot young test pilots.

Really?  You needed to tell us that?  And what does the "its" refer
to?  "[R]at-shack plains" are plural.

A long sentence from Wolfe [8]: "The idea in testing the X-1 was
to nurse it carefully into the transonic zone, up to seven-tenths,
eight-tenths, nine-tenths the speed of sound (.7 Mach, .8 Mach, .9
Mach) before attempting the speed of sound itself, Mach 1, even
though Bell and the Army already knew the X-1 had the rocket power
to go to Mach 1 and beyond, if there *was* any *beyond*."  You know
what the comment will be, right?  Yes, you are correct.

> The italics are for emphasis.

Somewhere along here, I was asking myself whether Prof. Savarese
chose this version to punish us.  Rather than focusing on Wolfe's
creativity, we have to push back against banality.  Or at least
those of us among that loyal fraternity of footnote fiends must
face this farce.  Nonetheless, we soldier on.

In doing so, we encounter what must be dozen or more footnotes that
comment on the way the Wolfe references fossils or something similar.
Do we need to see that much repetition?  I'm pretty sure even the
most dense of students would know what to look for after the third,
or fourth, or fifth such mention.

Then there are the missing comments.  If you're going to talk about
style, you should focus on some surprisingly strong section, or 
puzzling points, or just the wonder of Wolfe's writing.

Here's an example: "At night it would drop to near freezing, and
in December it would start raining, and the dry lakes would fill
up with a few inches of water, and some sort of putrid prehistoric
shrimps would work their way from out of the ooze, and sea gulls
would come flying in a hundred miles or more from the ocean, over
the mountains, to gobble up those squirming little throwbacks."

Don't you love the way that sentence builds and builds and builds?
The way Wolfe plays with the "and"s?  How he explains the distance
from the ocean as both being far ("a hundred miles or more") and
near (close enough for a sea gull to fly)?  The carefully chosen
adjectives and nouns ("putrid", "throwbacks").  We do get one of
the endless footnotes about "prehistoric" a sentence or two later,
but nothing about the sentences that seem so Wolfian.

A shorter one, revealing a different deficiency: "It was _Pygmalion_
in reverse."  Don't you need to explain _Pygmalion_ to the students
reading and explain the power of pulling that in?  students reading?
Do they learn anything here?  No.

"(In this moment when the Halusian Gulp is opening?)"  As far as I
can tell, "Halusian Gulp" is invented.  Is he playing with the sound
"hallucination"?  Is he using a flyboy term?  Nothing tells us.

A longer bit, which I'm block-quoting [9].

> On the ground the engineers could no longer see Yeager.  They could only 
hear ... that poker-hollow West Virginia drawl.

> "Had a mild buffet there ... jes the usual instability ..."

> _Jes the usual instability?_

> Then the X-1 reached the speed of .96 Mach, and that incredible
caint-hardlyin' aw-shuckin' drawl said:

> "Say, Ridley ... make a note here, will ya?" (_if you ain't got nothin' better
to do_) "... elevator effectiveness _re_gained."

> Just as Yeager had predicted, as the X-1 approached Mach 1, the stability
improved.  Yeager had his eyes pinned on the machometer.  The needle reached .96, fluctuated, and went off the scale.

> And on the ground they heard ... that voice:

> "Say, Ridley ... make another note, will ya?" (_if you ain't bored yet_)
"... there's somethin' wrong with this ol' machometer ..." (faint 
chuckle) "...it's gone kinda screwy on me..."

Do we hear anything about how this structure replicates that
opening of the piece?  Nope.  Do we consider that "incredible
caint-hardlyin' aw-shuckin'" description?  Well, most readers do.
But the annotators don't mention it.  The four or more voices?
Nope.  They just mention two [10].

> The point of view shifts back and forth between Yeager and the
ground engineers.  Since they can no longer see Yeager, Wolfe gives
us their exchange.  He begins with Yeager's voice.

I don't think I can go on any further.  As I said, reading this
version made me scream.  I wonder if I'm alone in feeling that way.
And I wonder if Prof. S. did that intentionally.

At least there was a lot more for us to talk about.

"I could do a whole course on this piece."  - R.S.

**_Postscript_**: I'm pretty sure the Wolfe piece first appeared
in _Esquire_ as "[Big Daddy Of the Skies](https://classic.esquire.com/article/1979/8/1/big-daddy-of-the-skies)".  I wonder why we don't use that version.
I wonder why the book doesn't.

[1] Or perhaps to have read it again.  I have a vague recollection of
having read it when it first came out.

[2] I didn't think Wolfe traditionally made much use of footnotes.

[3] "I think you mean 'figuratively'."

[4]  No, I mean "literally".  The sentences break apart and fall back
together, with fragments manipulated and joined in multiple ways.

[5] The town has since become famous as the source of a language used
by certain categories of interweb denizens.

[6] Just in case it's not clear, the "you" is intended for the
footnoters, not Prof. S.

[7] I would argue that Wolfe is intentionally pulling back in his
style here, working toward something closer to the old journalism.

[8] Not that long sentences are a surprise.

[9] I realize that I've previously used the block quotes for footnotes.
In this case, it seems better to use it for the eight or so
paragraphettes from Wolfe's piece.

[10] Yeah, I'm switching back to block quotes for footnotes.

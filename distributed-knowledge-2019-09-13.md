Distributed knowledge
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), academia*

During my first fifteen-or-so years at Grinnell, the Dean participated
in most of the major committees on campus.  In addition to Executive
Council, the Dean was also on the Committee for the Support of
Faculty Scholarship (CSFS), Curriculum Committee (CC), and Personnel
Committee (PC).  Once we started the triennial review system for
tenured faculty, the Dean also met with each faculty member after
their review to discuss their dossier.

As this activity meant that the Dean had both broad and detailed
knowledge of the College.  Since there are many connections between
the parts of the College, having one person [1] who had this knowledge
helped the College function.  As a faculty member, I can report
that I also found it a positive experience to know that the Dean
had detailed knowledge of my work.

Gathering all of this knowledge took a lot of time.  It likely interfered
with other aspects of the Dean's position.

When Dean Latham arrived, he received the added burden of supervising
Student Affairs.   That made it essentially impossible to continue
all of the prior activities of the Dean.  The first thing to go was
the post-review meeting with each faculty member.  Faculty were
encouraged to meet with the director of the Center for Teaching,
Learning, and Assessment and given the option to meet with the Dean.
I can't fault the Dean for what was likely two full weeks of work
[2]. But there's a difference between meeting with someone who has
the power and authority to provide resources for your work, and
someone who can just give advice.  On the other hand, I found Dean
Latham was always willing to meet to discuss issues [3], so perhaps
the required meetings were not so necessary.

Dean Latham also assigned leadership of Curriculum Committee,
Personnel Committee, and the Committee for the Support of Faculty
Scholarship to the Associate Deans.  On the positive side, that
meant that they had more time for each of those committees.  But
it also led to a situation that I call "distributed knowledge";
broad knowledge of the different activities on campus no longer lay
in a single person but was instead distributed among a group of
people who were expected to share with each other.  

As knowledge is distributed, some gets lost.  I recall a discussion
with an associate dean the year after Dean Latham had distributed
statistics about workloads in various departments that showed CS
as having one of the top two weekly student contact hours per faculty
member.  Nonetheless, the associate dean, who seemed to be unaware of
those data, made some comment like "You have enough faculty to
support your students."  This year, I see that one associate dean
supported changes to the software purchase policy that added
purchasing burdens for research software to departments, but did
not seem to communicate that with the associate dean in charge of
CSFS, which meant that there was no change to CSFS policies that
forbid the purchase of such software.

Those are just two examples; I worry about other times that we've
lost opportunities because the knowledge is distributed.  I don't
have any suggestions for change; I just wish that some things worked
better.

Postscript: I expect other issues are at play here.  I've seen a
shifting view of governance at Grinnell that is likely also at play.
That shifting view includes a tendency to invest shared governance
in committees, rather than the faculty as a whole [4], a reliance
on administrators and administrative units over faculty committees,
and an increased culture of "trust us" rather than the open discussion
I recall from my early years at the College.  I don't know what to
do about any of this.  However, as I said, I just wish there was more
communication.

Postscript: Yesterday I'd taken [my chill pill](chill-pill-2019-09-12)
and was feeling better about these kinds of issues.  But when I
looked at some of the email related to this musing, I heated up
again.  I see too much "we can do what we want; trust us".  Nonetheless,
putting the frustrations into a musing gets them out of my head,
and I'm chilling again.

[1] Or at least one person.

[2] A thirty or more minute meeting with the faculty member along with
time to review the person's dossier in detail.

[3] Or to read and respond to my email.

[4] For example, Curriculum Committee took on more authority over
course changes without discussing that change with the faculty as
a whole.

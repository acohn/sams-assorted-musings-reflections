Admitting defeat
================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), language, short.*

Yesterday, I wrote about my experience telling students not to use
the term "[Jeez](jeez)" (or Geez [1]) because it is a reference to someone
that many identify as Lord.

After reading that musing, my friends provided a wide variety of 
followup comments [2].

> Does that mean I can't use "Gee" either?

> Out go criminy, golly, jeepers, gee whiz, cripes, and holy cow.

> My Aunt always said, "Oh, my Word."  Same thing, right? [3] Or "Oh,
my goodness?"

> Also darn, golly, heck, by gum, dang, zounds, goodness (as an exclamation), other uses of good (as in good night!, good grief!), egad. But the greatest of these is zounds [4].

They missed "Jiminy Cricket" [5] and a bunch of others.

Damn.  There are just too many.  Perhaps I'm being too persnickety.
I give up.  I'll have to learn to accept these various forms of slang
profanity as they are and not treat them as swears.

But I'm still teaching students about the etymology of "Jeez".

Postscript: Yes, the use of "Damn" was intentional.

[i] I'm starting to wonder what I should think about [the title of a collection
of short stories by one of my favorite authors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmares_and_Geezenstacks).

[2] Some of which I've edited.

[3] My [quick search of the Interweb](https://www.quora.com/Where-did-the-phrase-oh-my-word-originate) suggests that "Oh my word" is intended as a way to
avoid saying "Oh my G-d".  Since the intent is to avoid profanity, I have
trouble thinking of it as the same thing.

[4] [Wikipedia](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/zounds) tells me that
"zounds" is an abbreviation of "G-d's wounds".

[5] And variants thereof, such as  "Jiminy Christmas".

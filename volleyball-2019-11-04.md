Volleyball

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), short*

**Congrats to our Volleyball team** [1] **for an excellent regular season, including [being unbeaten at home](https://pioneers.grinnell.edu/news/2019/11/2/womens-volleyball-pioneer-netters-shatter-school-record-for-wins-with-pair-of-saturday-wins.aspx?path=wvball)!**

I'm glad that I've had the opportunity to teach some members of the
team and I look forward to the opportunity to teach more.  One of
my favorite things about Grinnell is that we have so many talented
students, and that I regularly have the opportunity to watch them
demonstrate their talents, whether on the athletic field (or court),
in the classroom, on the stage, or wherever.

I feel fortunate to have had the time to attend a few matches this
year.  I wish I'd had the time to attend more [2].  When I've been
there, I've appreciated how well the team works together, how
supportive the players are of each other, and the athleticism of
the game [4].

I like to say that it's clear that the return of a wonderful alum
as an assistant coach this year is the primary reason for their
success.  But I know that many factors have contributed to their
success.  Coach Ragan '12 has built a great culture on the team;
when I watch, I appreciate seeing how he gives the players a chance
to talk together during time-outs before he comes over to talk to
them.  I know that Coach Hutchison recruited strong players who are
now 3rd years and seniors and who make a big difference.  Ragan
has clearly continued with successful recruiting.  But I still think
Labasan's return has had an impact.

I hope that I'll have the opportunity to see more matches.  I won't
be at Friday's semifinal match [5].  But I'm hopeful that they'll
win.  I don't know where or when the finals match will be.  At worst,
I guess there's always next year.  And I expect they'll have a good
group supporting them on Friday.

In any case, **congratulations** and **good luck** to a wonderful
group of student athletes and their coaches.

[1] Should I say "Women's Volleyball"?  We don't have a Men's Volleyball
team, so I think "Volleyball" suffices.

[2] For example, while I had hoped to see Saturday's matches, the
Swimming and Diving meet at Coe took precedence [3].

[3] More precisely, watching Middle Son dive took precedence.

[4] I'm amazed at how quickly the players react to the shots.

[5] See [my earlier musing](opportunities-2019-10-23) for what I'm
doing this coming weekend.

On language
===========

_Notes on language usage.  I didn't add this category until after musing
650, so there are likely many musings on language missing.  I hope to link
to them eventually._

[Choosing the right word](sanguine) (Musing #657)

> If only I could pronounce the right word correctly.

[Strunk & White and Williams](strunk-white-and-williams) (Musing #668)

> Clearer elements of style.

["A number of"](a-number-of) (Musing #676)

> Idioms I should not use.

[Busses and bussing](busses-bussing) (Musing #750)

> The number of s's matters.

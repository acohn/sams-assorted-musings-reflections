On Monday, 3 February 2020, a few hours before voters in Iowa caucus
for presidential candidates, the Faculty of Grinnell College will
select two nominees for the position of the Chair of the Faculty.
Here's the process, taken from the 9/16/19 [1] version of the
[_Faculty
Handbook_](http://web.grinnell.edu/dean/Handbook/FacultyHandbook.pdf).

> The Chair of the Faculty shall be elected at the first faculty
meeting in February of even calendar years preceding that academic
year in which office is assumed. The first and second nominating
ballots shall be taken at the first regular faculty meeting in
February. Members of the Faculty Organization Committee shall
distribute first nominating ballots early in the session and collect
and count them at once. The names of those nominees receiving the
highest number of votes which total two-thirds of the ballots cast
in the primary shall then be announced, after which the faculty
shall limit the nominees to the two persons receiving the highest
number of votes in a second nominating ballot. A final ballot shall
be made available the following day to the entire voting faculty.
The deadline for casting ballots shall be 4 PM (Central Time) the
Friday of the same week.

Okay, I realize that the description is not self-consistent.  The
Chair is not *elected* at the first faculty meeting in February.
Rather, they are *nominated* at the first faculty meeting.  Let's
add that to the list of things to fix when we write the _Faculty
Handbook_ [2].

Who can be Chair of the Faculty?  That's elsewhere in the _Faculty Handbook_,
which says,

> The Chair of the Faculty shall be elected biennially, in even
years, from among the Professors of the faculty; an individual may
not serve more than two consecutive terms.

As far as I can tell, that has been interpreted to mean Full Professors,
including Full Professors on Senior Faculty Status, but excluding the
President and the Dean of the College [4].

So that we don't elect [5] people who will be unlikely to serve if
elected, it's been our practice to distribute the list of eligible
candidates early and allow people to remove themselves from the list.

On December 20, we got the first eligibility list and were asked
to send an email by noon on Friday, 24 January 2020 if we wanted
our names removed from the list.  Yesterday, the current version
of the eligibility list for the Chair of the Faculty was released.
Why was a revised list distributed on January 22nd?  Probably to
remind people to remove their names.

My name is still on the list.  Yesterday, after seeing the list, a
colleague asked something like, "I see your name is on the list of
candidates.  Are you interested in serving as Chair of the Faculty?"
My answer was "Not really, particularly given staffing in my
department; however, I believe that shared governance suggests that
we leave our names on the list unless we have significant conflicts."
Or something like that.

I see from [an earlier musing](another-month-2019-12) that the
initial list had 68 names of it, 24 of whom were SFS, on Council,
entering or leaving Deanships, or known to be on leave next year,
leaving 44 potential candidates.

The 22 January list is down to forty names.  Of those forty, I count
fourteen on or about to be on Senior Faculty Status, three center
directors, and one person already scheduled to be on Council in
2020-21.  SFS faculty traditionally do not want to serve as Chair
of the Faculty.  Center directors traditionally do not serve as
Chair of the Faculty, or perhaps it's never come up [6].  And, while I
suppose it's possible that a member of Council switches to Chair of
the Faculty, that would require we then elect a replacement for
their position.  In any case, that means that we're down to twenty-two
or so real candidates.  Of the remainder, two are former Chairs of
the Faculty and one is a former Dean of the College [7].  The list is
getting shorter and shorter.  Or perhaps those folks are enthusiastic
about serving the College again.  

So what happens next?  I assume some folks who are on the list will
see the size of the list and remove their names.  At some point,
we'll get a final list of eligible candidates [8].  Some of those
will fall into the category of people who don't read their email
and, therefore, did not realize that they had to remove their names.
Others will assume they won't be elected.  Nonetheless, there should
be a good list of candidates left after noon on Friday.

In recent years, we've taken recommendations from the floor of the
Faculty Meeting.  Most people would call those "nominations", but
the _Handbook_ says that nominations are the result of the balloting.
Hence, we call what happens on the floor "suggestions" or
"recommendations".  It's considered good form to ask people if they
are interested in serving before you suggest or recommend them.

It's almost time to start emailing some of the awesome people on
the list.  Perhaps we should also ask some of the Center Directors.
But I'll wait until the final list comes out.

Postscript: As I noted, there are twenty-two people on my list of
people who are on the current eligibility list and are not SFS,
directing a Center, or already on Council.  Here's how they distribute
across divisions: Nine Humanities, Ten Science, and Three Social
Studies.

Postscript: I'm not sure why someone asked if I'd be willing to
serve.  I don't think I'd make a good Chair of the Faculty.  I'm
too opinionated to be properly representative.  I'm not particularly
articulate [9].  I don't have the social graces to deal with Trustees.
As far as I can tell, the only things I have to recommend me are
(a) I care deeply about the College, (b) I remember way too much
trivia about decisions [10,11], and (c) I'm not afraid to complain
and criticize openly.  Oh, I also care deeply about shared governance
and want to see it expanded to include staff governance.  And no,
that is not my platform.  As I said, those positives are far outweighed
by the weaknesses I exhibit.

[1] I would prefer to designate it as "16 September 2019" or "2019-09-16".
However, the version says "Last Revision: 9/16/19" on every page.

[2] By "we", I mean "the College".  However, I have expressed a
willingness to participate in the group that takes ownership of the
rewrite [3].

[3] Yeah, I know.  Saying "Please, can I do that?" is not the same
as [saying "No"](no-2020-01-21).  It may even be worse than saying
"Yes".  However, since I complain so much about how people interpret
the _Handbook_, it seems only fair that I play a part in helping
improve it.  Or something like that.

[4] Yes, both the President and the Dean are considered members of 
the faculty.  Dean Harris's tenure was approved at the fall Board
meeting.

[5] Or nominate.

[6] A colleague reminded me that at least one Chair of the Faculty 
was simultaneous Director of the Rosenfield Center.  So we could
elect the Director of the CTLA, the Director of the Rosenfield
Center, or the Director of Prairie Studies, all of whose names were
still on the list as of 22 January.

[7] There are also a bunch of former Dean's of the College and Chairs of 
the Faculty in the list of SFS faculty.

[8] Probably on Friday, 31 January 2020, along with the rest of the
agenda for the 3 February 2020 meeting.

[9] I can be articulate when I write.  I often stumble when I speak.

[10] Insert obligatory joke about elephants.

[11] Of course, Elaine Marzluff remembers more than I do [12].

[12] The elephant joke does not apply to her.

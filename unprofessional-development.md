Unprofessional development
==========================

> Just so you know, a was "interviewed" about professional development opportunities (in my field, GIS) yesterday. I used your [essays] as an example. 

> It's PD because you are reflecting on (aka learning from) many things
that relate to or even are your work as an educator. Further, some of
your essays, I'm thinking, have pushed you towards leadership roles on
issues about which you are passionate. Finally, we who read your essays
(I confess I don't catch all of them) are forming what might become a
learning community.

But it's unprofessional, too.  There's a reason that I have to take down
a few essays.

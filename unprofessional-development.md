(Un)professional development
============================

The other day, a friend posted the folowing message in response to
one of my Essays of the Day.

> Just so you know, a was "interviewed" about professional development
opportunities (in my field, GIS) yesterday. I used your essay challenge as
an example.

I'm not always good at interpreting comments, so I asked what challenge
they were talking about.  There are so many challenges related to my
essays: my challenge to you folks to write regular essays; or my challenge
to myself to get to inbox zero, which was going on at the same time; or
my challenge to my readers to donate more to Grinnell; or my challenge
to myself to learn how to write profiles; or my challenge to myself to
write a technical book in a month, which was also going on at the same
time; my challenge to my readers to pick their favorite essays, which
was old at the time; and probably a number of other ones I've forgotten.
After some back-and-forth, it became clear that they meant the challenge
I've given myself to write a (somewhat relevant) essay each day.

Once we'd settled that, I took the bait and asked why the essays were
professional development.  Here's what they wrote back.

> It's PD because you are reflecting on (aka learning from) many things
that relate to or even are your work as an educator. Further, some of
your essays, I'm thinking, have pushed you towards leadership roles on
issues about which you are passionate. Finally, we who read your essays
(I confess I don't catch all of them) are forming what might become a
learning community.

Do I agree with all of that?

But it's unprofessional, too.  There's a reason that I have to take down
a few essays.

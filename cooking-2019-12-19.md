Yesterday at water aerobics, someone mentioned that they had made
black bean chili the other day.  I thought to myself "Wow, it's
been a long time since I've made chili."  Then I realized that I
hadn't made anything non-trivial for a long time [1], at least not
outside of the holiday season.

For example, this Thanksgiving, I helped youngest with bagels,
cooked the turkey, ham, and brisket, attempted the gravy [2], made
the sweet potato casserole and the stuffing, and, um, maybe something
else.  However, none of those are particularly complicated.  So
perhaps I don't need to include the disclaimer at the end of the
previous paragraph [3].

It used to be that I cooked regularly.  I didn't make gourmet food,
but I made food with multiple ingredients that required multiple
steps.  Chili was one of my go-to dishes as was quiche.  When Eldest
Son and I visited Mass MOCA a few months ago, I ordered quiche for
lunch and he said, "What's quiche?"  So I guess it's been longer than
I thought.

I cooked through most of college once I moved off campus in my
second year.  I cooked through graduate school.  I cooked when
I was at Dartmouth.  I recall cooking when I was here.  But at some
point, I stopped.  I wonder when.  I wonder why.

One of my favorite events to cook for was our formerly annual
Ground Hog's Day Potluck Brunch, a tradition that Michelle and I
inherited from my parents.  I always made bagels, baked eggs, and quiche.
I made some other things, too, depending on how things were going.
For example, in some years I'd make fruit salad in and other years
Michelle did.  But we haven't held a Ground Hog's Day Potluck Brunch
for a long time.  How long?  I'm not sure.  I recall having one after
we added to the house, but that's about fifteen years ago.  Why did
we stop?  It was a combination of issues.  It was hard to think about
having brunch after we lost Lloyd and even harder after we lost my
mother and Kathy.  A lot of events started coming into conflict [4].

But that doesn't mean that I shouldn't keep cooking.  

Perhaps it's that I've spent much of the last decade feeling stressed
and low on time.  Cooking should feel like a nice break, but, too
often, all that I could imagine doing was cooking up some chicken or
something equivalent.

Anyway, as I reflected on these things, I decided I should try cooking
again.  So, on the way home from water aerobics, I stopped at HyVee and
Fareway and got some ingredients.

Then I got home. I brought my computer into the kitchen so that I could
listen to music [7,8].  Then I made ...

Can you guess?

Sour mix.

Why did I make sour mix?  Um, for no particularly good reason.  I had made
simple syrup the other day and, in doing so, learned that sour mix is
essentially simple syrup made with lemon juice and lime juice.  So it
seemed like a good thing to attempt.  Plus, sours are one of my favorite
drinks.  Rum sours.  Whiskey sours.  Tequila sours [10].

After that, I went ahead and made something a bit more complex.  That
is, I made a chili-like substance.  Why do I call it "a chili-like
substance"?  Because you may have strong opinions about what goes
in chili and I may not have followed them.  This substance has
tomatoes [11], onions, chicken [12], black beans [14,15,16], a red
bell pepper, a poblano pepper [17], and some spices that include
chili powder.  Although I live in Iowa, I did not add corn.  I still
don't understand why people put corn in chili.

I tried a few things that I haven't done in the past.  I toasted
the spices [18].  I included spices and some onions and chopped
poblano when I cooked the beans [19].  I roasted the peppers on the
stove [20].  I had not previously tried roasting peppers on the
stove for any purpose, but it went relatively well.  However, I
think I prefer using the grill or, if necessary, the convection
oven.  I spiced each ingredient separately before adding it to the
pot.

As I said, I think of this as a non-trivial dish to make or at
least one that requires multiple steps.  It requires cooking a
variety of things separately.  It requires playing with spices [21].
I also have some traditional steps that add a little bit of extra
work.  I tend to use whole canned tomatoes and blend them to an
appropriate consistency; that seems to give me a better result than
tomato sauce, tomato paste, or just diced tomatoes [22].  I also
blend one onion with a bit of tomato juice from the cans to get an
onion slurry that adds something different than the chopped onions.

What else have I done in the past when making chili?  I've forgotten.
Perhaps I'll remember the next time I make chili.

Did I learn anything from all of this activity?  I do enjoy cooking,
at least when I don't have time pressures involved.  I enjoy black
beans.  The ones I made turned out well.  I thought about setting 
some of them aside to eat separately, but I felt like I needed all of
them in the main recipe.  Maybe I'll make some more another day.

Next time, I think I'll go back to ground beef, I'll use more poblanos,
and I might try cooking the beans in something other than water.  Maybe
stock.  Maybe beer.  Maybe tomato juice.  Maybe a combination thereof.

Postscript: After the chili, I decided to try an experiment in reducing
a bottle of ginger ale back down to ginger syrup.  As Michelle suggested
afterwards, it might have been okay if the ginger ale was made with
sugar, but it was made with corn syrup.  In any case, I turned away for
a bit too long [23] and managed to burn it to the bottom.  Plus, our
house now smells like burnt sweetener.

Fortunately, I have a pot scraper [24] and some chainmail [25].  It took
a bit, but I managed to clean the bottom after thirty minutes or so.

Postscript: How did the other dishes turn out?  

The sour mix is a bit thick, which provides an interesting mouth
feel.  But it doesn't always mix as well as I'd like; it sometimes
sinks to the bottom.  The taste is nice.  I enjoyed my bourbon sour
more than my rum sour.  I'm not sure what I'll try next.  Oh, I did
figure out that it tastes great on cornbread.

The chili [26] is also good, particularly since I let it sit in the
fridge overnight to allow the tastes to meld a bit more.  It has a
nice, smokey, flavor, which may be due to the poblano, the can of
fire-roasted tomatoes, or the cumin [27].  And I like the way the
chicken worked out.  It has the texture I wanted (more substantial
than ground beef) and a good taste.  Still, a few more black beans
would have made the substance better.

[1] Yes, I realize that chili is comparatively trivial.  But I'm good
at making comparatively trivial things more complex.

[2] It did not come out as well as I'd hoped.

[3] Oh well.  I'm too lazy to go back and edit it.  And if I edited
it, I'd need to edit the next paragraph.  All that seems to complex.

[4] Not just the Super Bowl, which used to be a week or two off
from Ground Hog's day [5], but also a variety of kid events.  There
always seemed to be a swimming event on the weekend we would normally
hold our party [6].

[5] This year, it's the same day as Ground Hog's Day, February 2.

[6] This year, the Grinnell Mini-Invite is on February 1, which would
be our normal alternative.

[7] It's been a long time since I've had speakers attached to the
stereo.  And Michelle borrowed the set of wireless speakers I like
to use.

[8] The _Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society_, if you
care.  I don't keep good enough track of the versions, but I'm pretty
sure I chose the three-disc version from a decade or so back [9].  

[9] I have not yet purchased the new deluxe version.  Given that I own
multiple versions, it's not clear that I need the new deluxe version.

[10] Yes, there are differences between tequila sours and margaritas.
But both combine the alcohol and some citrusy stuff.

[11] More on that later.

[12] I traditionally use ground beef but felt like whole chunks of
meat.

[14] As you may recall, the whole adventure was inspired by someone
saying that they made black-bean chili.

[15] I traditionally use chili beans or kidney beans.  However, these 
days I prefer black beans.  

[16] I am not now, nor have I never been, a resident of Texas.

[17] I discovered that at Fareway, one poblano pepper costs about half
of what one red bell pepper costs.

[18] I toasted the spices repeatedly; I used them for the beans,
the chicken, the onions, and the tomato base.

[19] I prefer to use dried beans rather than canned beans.

[20] I love gas stoves.

[21] Recipe?  What's a recipe?

[22] I also use a can of diced tomatoes.  This time, I added a can of
smoked crushed tomatoes.

[23] Five minutes, to be precise.

[24] A Lil' Chizler, to be precise.

[25] It's great for cleaning cast iron.  And that's why I have it.

[26] Or "chili-like substance".

[27] Probably a combination.

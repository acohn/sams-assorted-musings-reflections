Cooking
=======

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

Yesterday at water aerobics, someone mentioned that they had made
black bean chili the other day.  I thought to myself "Wow, it's
been a long time since I've made chili."  Then I realized that I
hadn't really made anything non-trivial for a long time [1], at
least not outside of holiday season.

For example, this Thanksgiving, I helped youngest with bagels,
cooked the turkey, ham, and brisket, attempted the gravy [2], made
the sweet potato casserole and the stuffing, and, um, maybe something
else.  However, none of those are particularly complicated.  So
perhaps I don't need to include the disclaimer at the end of the
previous paragraph [3].

It used to be that I cooked regularly.  I didn't make gourmet food,
but I made food with multiple ingredients that required multiple
steps.  Chili was one of my go-to dishes as was quiche.  When Eldest
Son and I visited Mass MOCA a few months ago, I ordered quiche for
lunch and he said, "What's quiche?"  So I guess it's been longer than
I thought.

I cooked through most of college once I moved off campus in my
second year.  I cooked through graduate school.  I cooked when
I was at Dartmouth.  I recall cooking when I was here.  But at some
point, I stopped.  I wonder when.  I wonder why.

One of my favorite events to cook for was our formerly annual
Ground Hog's Day Potluck Brunch, a tradition that Michelle and I
inherited from my parents.  I always made bagels, baked eggs, and quiche.
I made some other things, too, depending on how things were going.
For example, in some years I'd make fruit salad in and other years
Michelle did.  But we haven't held a Ground Hog's Day Potluck Brunch
for a long time.  How long?  I'm not sure.  I recall having one after
we added to the house, but that's about fifteen years ago.  Why did
we stop?  It was a combination of issues.  It was hard to think about
having brunch after we lost Lloyd and even harder after we lost my
mother and Kathy.  A lot of events started coming into conflict [4].

But that doesn't mean that I shouldn't keep cooking.  

Perhaps it's that I've spent much of the last decade feeling stressed
and low on time.  Cooking should feel like a nice break, but, too
often, all that I could imagine doing was cooking up some chicken or
something equivalent.

Anyway, as I reflected on these things, I decided I should try cooking
again.  So, on the way home from water aerobics, I stopped at HyVee and
Fareway and got some ingredients.

Then I got home. I brought my computer into the kitchen so that I could
listen to music [7,8].  Then I made ...

Can you guess?

Sour mix.

Why did I make sour mix?  Um, for no particularly good reason.  I had made
simple syrup the other day and, in doing so, learned that sour mix is
essentially simple syrup made with lemon juice and lime juice.  So it
seemed like a good thing to attempt.  Plus, I really like sours.  Rum
sours.  Whiskey sours.  Tequila sours [10].

After that, I went ahead and made something a bit more complex.  That
is, I made a chili-like substance.  Why do I call it "a chili-like
substance"?  Because you may have strong opinions about what goes
in chili and I may not have followed them.  This substance has
tomatoes [11], onions, chicken [12], black beans [14,15,16], a red
bell pepper, a poblano pepper [17], and some spices that include
chili powder.  Although I live in Iowa, I did not add corn.  I still
don't understand why people put corn in chili.

I tried a few things that I haven't done in the past.  I toasted
the spices [18].  I included spices and some onions and chopped
poblano when I cooked the beans [19].  I roasted the peppers on the
stove [20].  I had not previously tried roasting peppers on the
stove for any purpose, but it went relatively well.  However, I
think I prefer using the grill or, if necessary, the convection
oven.  I spiced each ingredient separately before adding it to the
pot.

As I said, I think of this as a non-trivial dish to make, or at
least one that requires multiple steps.  It requires cooking a
variety of things separately.  It requires playing with spices [21].
I also have some traditional steps that add a little bit of extra
work.  I tend to use whole canned tomatoes and blend them to an
appropriate consistency; that seems to give me a better result than
tomato sauce, tomato paste, or just diced tomatoes [21].  I also
blend one onion with a bit of tomato juice from the cans to get an
onion slurry that adds something different than the chopped onions.

What else have I done in the past when making chili?  I've forgotten.
Perhaps I'll remember the next time I make chili.

Did I learn anything from all of this activity?  I do enjoy cooking,
at least when I don't have time pressures involved.  I enjoy black
beans.  The ones I made turned out well.  I thought about setting 
some of them aside to eat separately, but I felt like I needed all of
them in the main recipe.  Maybe I'll make some more another day.

Next time, I think I'll go back to ground beef, I'll use more poblanos,
and I might try cooking the beans in something other than water.  Maybe
stock.  Maybe beer.  Maybe tomato juice.  Maybe a combination thereof.

[1] Yes, I realize that chili is comparatively trivial.  But I'm good
at making comparatively trivial things more complex.

[2] It did not come out as well as I'd hoped.

[3] Oh well.  I'm too lazy to go back and edit it.  And if I edited
it, I'd need to edit the next paragraph.  All that seems to complex.

[4] Not just the Super Bowl, which used to be a week or two off
from Ground Hog's day [5], but also a variety of kid events.  There
always seemed to be a swimming event the weekend we would want to
hold our party [6].

[5] This year, it's the same day as Ground Hog's Day, February 2.

[6] This year, the Grinnell Mini-Invite is on February 1, which would
be our normal alternative.

[7] It's been a long time since I've had speakers attached to the
stereo.  And Michelle borrowed the set of wireless speakers I like
to use.

[8] The _Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society_, if you
care.  I don't keep good enough track of the versions, but I'm pretty
sure I chose the three-disc version from a decade or so back [9].  

[9] I have not yet purchased the new deluxe version.  Given that I own
multiple versions, it's not clear that I need the new deluxe version.

[10] Yes, there are differences between tequila sours and margaritas.
But both combine the alcohol and some citrusy stuff.

[11] More on that later.

[12] I traditionally use ground beef but felt like whole chunks of
meat.

[14] As you may recall, the whole adventure was inspired by someone
saying that they made black-bean chili.

[15] I traditionally use chili beans or kidney beans.  However, these 
days I prefer black beans.  

[16] I am not now, nor have I never been, a resident of Texas.

[17] I discovered that at Fareway, one poblano pepper costs about half
of what one red bell pepper costs.

[18] I toasted the spices multiple times, since I used them for the
beans, the chicken, the onions, and the tomato base.

[19] I prefer to use dried beans rather than canned beans.

[20] I love gas stoves.

[21] Recipe?  What's a recipe?

[22] I also use a can of diced tomatoes.  This time, I added a can of
smoked crushed tomatoes.

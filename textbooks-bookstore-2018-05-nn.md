Textbooks and the bookstore
===========================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), intellectual property*

The other day, I learned that the bookstore was selling international
editions of a textbook [1].  Some time before that, I noticed that the
bookstore was exclusively selling remaindered copies [2] of work of fiction
that had been selected for a class.  Both choices make me uncomfortable,
but I'm not sure that they should.  This musing represents my attempt to
consider the issue in some more depth [3].

Ideally, intellectual property law, or at least copyright law, balances 
the interests of four or so parties.  The authors of a work should be able
to receive compensation for their work [4].  Consumers who purchase the work
should be able to use the work as they wish.  Publishers [5] who spend
effort refining a work for sale and take financial risks in bringing the
work to market also deserve compensation.  And the nation benefits from
a rich set of created works [6].

One key issue in copyright is, of course, the right to make copies.
In societies without copyright that sufficiently protects authors or
publishers, authors and their publishers necessarily worry about "bootleg"
copies of their work.  If I write a novel that garners acclaim, it should
not be possible for someone else to print copies of it.  If a publisher
supported me in developing that novel, I should not be able to suddenly
switch to another publisher.

But we also have traditional consumers' rights.  If I buy a table from
someone, I am then free to do what I wish with that table.  I can resell
it.  I can carve designs on it and sell it as an artwork.  I can cut it
down into kindling and start a fire.  In the case of books, the first 
sale doctrine ensures that consumers have the right to resell the books
that they purchase.

What about the nation's broader interests?  Ensuring that authors receive
compensation helps encourage them to develop new works which enhances the
standing and intellectual capital of a nation.  Ensuring that publishers
cannot be undercut by competitors helps encourage them to publish new
works which benefits the financial state of the nation.  But there are
limits.  For example, the US fair use doctrine suggests that the nation
also benefits when excerpts of works are used in education, news, and
criticism.  Fair use is a delicate balancing act, but an important one.

Copyright law as a whole is also a balancing act.  I'm not sure if it's
ever been quite right.  But a number of factors are tilting the balance
in problematic ways.  Some tilting is intentional.  Some is a byproduct
of other changes.  Intentional tilting often happens through legislation;
for example, the span of copyright keeps increasing every time Disney
is at risk of losing some.  My reading is that the Music Modernization
Act will do severe damage to songwriters in an attempt to benefit
record labels and services like Spotify [7].

But the Internet has also had a huge impact, particularly in the textbook
market.  The biggest impact is on the role of used texts.  I think
we've always had textbook resellers.  But the rise of the Internet
has made it that much easier for them to connect with bookstores
and manage inventories.  And individuals now find it much easier to
resell their textbooks, not just to friends at the same institution,
but to almost anyone.  A seller's account on Amazon is easy to obtain.
And smart students shop for used texts.

In reaction, textbook publishers appear to have significantly increased
their pricing.  While I appreciate the work that publishers put into their
work, I find a lot of that pricing immoral.  $100 for a disposable workbook
is insane.  But for textbooks that you know are going to be used again and
again and again and for which you only receive compensation once?  I can
understand some of the reasons that prices have gone up; if a textbook
gets resold four times on average rather than once [8], you have to make
much more on the initial sale.

Textbook publishers really do a lot of important work, from making sure
that textbooks are reviewed broadly to supporting the development of
ancillary materials to publicizing the work to faculty.  They and their
authors deserve compensation.

Still, the hundreds of dollars that textbooks command seems excessive.
And some of the development is of things that I don't care about and
don't regularly use as a professor, such as electronic resources [9].

As a professor, I've reacted to textbook prices in a number of ways.  For
some classes, I've written my own materials or adapted those of colleagues
in the department.  CSC 151 has always had locally written materials.
I also wrote large amounts of material for CSC 152 (now 207).  For some
classes, I've looked for cheaper textbooks or open-source textbooks.  In
CSC 321 and CSC 322, I use one text that is available free online, one
that is available for $10 in electronic format, and one that is part of
the ACM professional development collection, and so available as part
of the students' $19 ACM membership [10].  And for some, I've used
professional texts, ones that I expect to see on their bookshelves in
a decade.  Kernighan and Ritchie fits in that category, as does _Design
Patterns_, as does CLRS [11].  But there have also been times that I've
chosen a commercial textbook because I couldn't find anything better or
as good.  In the end, I want the text that best serves my students.

Where were we?  Oh, yeah.  This musing was supposed to be about
international editions and remainders.  I wanted to get some background
in place to help myself consider the various issues at play.

International editions are an interesting case.  Publishers and
authors accept less for international editions because they serve
the greater good.  The assumption is that they are produced for
a non-US market and that the textbook development is, in effect,
subsidized by domestic sales. Since [a legal case a few years
back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtsaeng_v._John_Wiley_%26_Sons,_Inc.)
determined that these textbooks are covered under first-sale doctrine,
it is legal to buy and sell them in the US, even though they generally
say "not produced for sale in the US".

Although that case clarified the legality of domestic sales of
international editions, my impression was that the sales generally
happened online and through non-institutional channels.  Having a
bookstore sell international editions feels different.  I know that I
would not feel comfortable asking for a desk copy or an examination copy
of a textbook if my institution was only selling international copies
of that textbook.  

I don't feel the same way about texts for which we sell only used copies.
I'd certainly feel comfortable asking for a desk copy if we only sold
used copies.  After all, publishers do seem to  set prices under the
assumption that texts get resold.  I also don't feel the same way about
texts that have a legal free online version.  In that case, the online
version is part of the publishing model; for whatever reason, they feel
that enough physical copies [12] are sold that the free online version 
is appropriate.  And I know that even when the text is available for free
online, some students buy copies.

But the international copies?  I don't think that's part of the
publisher's calculus.  I guess I'd assume that publishers assume that
domestic bookstores don't regularly stock international editions.
I certainly wouldn't want that publisher to know that we were selling
international copies.

What about the other side?  There are some fairly significant benefits
to students being able to pick up an affordable printed copy on campus.
Students are more likely to be able to afford $25 for the international
edition than the $176 list price for a hardcover [14].  It's not much
different than the $35 the publisher charages for a legal "digital
subscription" copy, but I don't really like the "digital subscription"
model, which undermines first sale and provide an assumption that
students won't have long-term benefit from the text.  I also prefer that
student work from printed texts if they can; I think the evidence is that
students read printed texts better.  And I'd rather that students have
direct access to the text rather than relying on a friend or the library.
So there are a lot of benefits to a $25 copy.  And I suppose that students
could buy it online for $25 in any case [15].

[1] An international edition of a textbook is an edition designed for
students in another country, typically one not as wealthy as the US.
International editions generally have the same content but usually have
lesser production values and may have different questions.

[2] A remaindered copy is a copy that the publisher decides is no
longer sellable as new.  It could be a return from a bookstore.  It
could be that they printed many more copies than they sold.  As far
as I know, authors recieve no royalties from remainders.  You can often
identify a remainder by a big black marked stripe along the side of the
text.

[3] I must admit that my muse leads me in some fairly strange directions.

[4] Assuming, of course, that they wish to receive compensation.

[5] Or equivalent.

[6] I accept that I have a somewhat American perspective on IP law.  The
parts of the constitution that focus on intellectual property talk about
the beneftis to the nation.

[7] If you want to hear more from the songwriters' side, I'd suggest
checking out [The Trichordist](https://thetrichordist.com/).  At some
point, I'll write more about IP and music, including my reaction to the
awesomely cheap multi-disc jazz sets available from the UK, which I
expect provide absolutely no compensation to anyone.

[8] Those numbers are fictitious.

[9] Electronic resources are often especially expensive to develop.

[10] That assumes that students decide to join ACM.

[11] Sorry for using names that only insiders will understand.  But the
names aren't all that important.

[12] Or licenses for ancillaries.

[14] Hmmm ... that's more than $160 for a textbook that was first
published in 2005.  

[15] In fact, if you search the title and author on Amazon, the first
result is the international edition.

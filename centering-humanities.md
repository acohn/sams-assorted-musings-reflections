Centering the humanities [1]
============================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), short*

The other day, I was driving by the new HSSC and saw a sign in front
that said, "Humanities and Social Studies Center" [2].  I was puzzled,
since I've always referred to it as "The Humanities and Social Studies
Complex" [3].  As I thought about it, I realized that the "Center"
version is what I've been seeing in recent announcements from the
College, such as the Special Campus Memo about our new Dean, Anne
F. Harris [4,5].

On the one hand, that naming makes sense.  After all, the building
in which I work is the Noyce Science Center [6].  On the other, we
often use "Center" at Grinnell to mean an entity devoted to some area.
We have a Center for Prairie Studies, a Center for Teaching, Learning,
and Assessment, a Wilson Center for Innovation and Leadership, and, um,
a Center for the Humanities.

I'm sure that most Grinnellians will be able to tell the two apart.
But what about outsiders?  "_Where can I find the Humanities Center_?"
"The Center for the Humanities or the Humanities and Social Studies
Center?"  "_Um, I'm not sure.  I'm a guest speaker for the symposium._"
"Oh, that's the Center for the Humanities.  You can find it on the third
floor of the Humanities and Social Science Center [7]."

Even without that confusion, it strikes me that "complex" is a better
term. The [OED](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/complex)
[8,9] tells me that a complex is "A group or system of different things
that are linked in a close or complicated way" or "A group of similar
buildings or facilities on the same site".  That seems to describe
the HSSC.  I realize that it's now one big edifice.  But it consists of
at least two inner buildings with an outer wrapper.

But maybe it's not the center.  Now I'm confused.  I went to look
something up and discovered that in [an article in the _Grinnell
Magazine_](http://magazine.grinnell.edu/learningspaces/arh-carnegie/faq),
it's called the Complex.  In [the project overview
page](http://comm.sites.grinnell.edu/hssc-project-overview/),
it's the Center.  But there's also [an update that calls it the "HSSC
complex"](https://www.grinnell.edu/news/hssc-construction) [10].

Is consistent naming that complex?

Postscript: Does anyone know have an authoritative answer about the name
of the HSSC?

[1] And the social studies.  But not the fine-arts humanities.

[2] That sign seems to have disappeared.

[3] Once in a while, I refer to it as "The Humanities and Social
Science Complex".

[4] In particular, that memo includes the statement, "Anne will be
joining the College at a time when our academics are remarkably strong,
with unparalleled faculty, a distinctive individually advised curriculum,
and robust academic facilities, to include the *Humanities and Social
Studies Center* slated to open in 2020."  [Emphasis mine.]

[5] It looks like Dean Harris will be a great addition to the College.
I wish her luck at [mastering Grinnell](mastering-grinnell).

[6] Officially, the Robert N. Noyce '49 Science Center.

[7] That's a placeholder; I have no idea where in the HSSC the Center for
Humanities will be housed.

[8] The Oxford English Dictionary.

[9] Or maybe that's the EOLD - English Oxford Living Dictionary.

[10] That page also notes "This will be the new home of the Anthropology
department when finished."  I had thought that the building would include
other departments, too.

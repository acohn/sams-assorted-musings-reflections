Web Accessibility, Continued
============================

*This essay is temporarily on hold while I discuss with folks some
issues raised in the essay.*

Short version: <http://haenfler.sites.grinnell.edu/> has an inaccessible
image spinner (aka carousel).  It's inaccessible because the images have
no alt tags and because spinners need controllers to be accessible.
The course looks awesome, but the site is not.  Amazingly, everyone
seems to be trying to pass the buck on who should ensure that sites
are accessible.

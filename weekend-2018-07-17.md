Reflections on "just another summer weekend"
===========================================

*Topics/tags: [Overcommitment](index-overcommitment), [Code camps](index-code-camps)*

A few days ago, I posted about [my plans for "just another summer
weekend"](weekend-2018-07-13).  I had promised myself that I'd reflect
back on whether or not I'd succeed at what I planned [1].  Here goes.

I stayed up too late on Friday night.  I can't remember why.

On Saturday morning, I got up at about 7:30 to attend Ridiculous Days.
I was relatively good.  The only place I shopped was at the bookstore
and I did not purchase all that much [2].  I got a new Orange Tigers
sweatshirt [3].  That should help on mid-fall football nights and
early-spring tennis afternoons.  They had umbrellas for $3.00 each.
Umbrellas seem to disappear around our house.  I picked up five.  Of
course, I thought the were Grinnell College umbrellas and they turned
out to be GHS umbrellas.  Still, no biggie.  And I bought a few red pens.
I bought *no books*.  I bought *no tchotchkes*.  And, as I said, the
only place I shopped was at the bookstore.

I should mention that I saw two friends at the bookstore who read my
musings and they both said, "Shouldn't you be asleep rather than looking
at books?"  They were probably right.  But I didn't spend much time and
I was glad to get some umbrellas.

After getting back from the sale, I did a lot of work with Michelle
around the house.  We hung a bunch of paintings [4].    We rearranged
some furniture and moved the TV.  I don't recall what else we did.

Then I took a nap.  Yay naps!

I woke up to do the book sort at Friends of Drake Library.  As I said,
I was able to bring over four boxes of books.  I will admit that I'm not
fond of the new sorting procedures, which have evolved over the years.
It's clear that people are frustrated from too many years of too many
leftovers from the book sale and that is affecting choices.  Oh well,
that's how life goes sometimes.  I've always been fond of "Put it out
and see if it sells", but I know how difficult that can make things.  I
did grab a few books, mostly those I could not bear to see hit the
garbage bin [5].

I don't recall what I did in the afternoon [6].  I think we hung some
more pictures and did a bit more rearranging.  I [worked on my email a
bit](inbox-zero-revisited-03).  I mused.  And, um, I think I just relaxed.

I slept in on Sunday morning.  It was an awesome feeling to be able to
sleep in.

Once I woke up, I started Sunday with some unplanned straightening.  I got
fed up with a few of the piles that tend to accumulate in our house.
I'm not sure if it happens to you, but we regularly seem to have the
issue that one person puts something down "temporarily", another person
puts something on top of that first thing, and another puts something on
top of that other thing.  At that point, everyone decides "Oh, that pile
isn't mine" and it sits there for, well, forever.  In any case, we have
a *lot* of those piles in our house.  I worked on a pile on the stairs,
a pile in the corner of the kitchen, and a pile in the living room.
It took some time, but I felt a sense of accomplishment.  Plus, I
identified some stuff to get rid of [7].

After that, I spent about nine hours working on [materials for the code
camp](web-of-racket).  That felt like time well spent.  And, believe it
or not, but it was fun.

Okay, so what *didn't* I do?  Let's see.  I didn't work on the plant life
around our house.  But I hadn't really expected to do that.  I spent
less time rearranging the front room than I had expected.  However,
I did spend more time straightening around the house, so it balances out.
I spent a little less time on the code camp than I had planned.  But it
was enough.  I didn't spend time on Project Callisto.  It turns out that
that's okay; I learned on Monday that the project may be going in very
different directions [8].  I had a wide variety of medium-length tasks to
do for the department and for my fall fellowship.  I got none of those
done [9].

In the original musing, I wrote, "there's probably a bunch more that I've
forgotten and that will come up".  It turns out that nothing else came up.
That probably means that I wasn't paying enough attention.

Still, it was a relatively productive weekend *and* a relatively relaxing
weekend.  I'll call that a success.

[1] Did I promise to tell you what I accomplished?  I don't think so.
But, hey, it only seems fair.

[2] If I'd known that our code camp needed lanyards, I might have bought
some of those.

[3] I've promised Michelle that I'll give away or throw away one of my
old Tigers sweatshirts.

[4] That reminds me, I still have to find places for the paintings we took
down.

[5] Some old Latin prayer books.  I gave those to a friend.  A copy of
_Queer Eye for the Straight Guy_ that I thought one of my students would
enjoy reading.  And a copy of "Sammy", just because it has a name that some
people call me.  I'll probably get rid of that soon.

[6] Clearly, I was still behind on sleep.

[7] I was able to throw out a bunch of paperwork from when I was Committee
Chair of our local BSA troop.  I found a bunch of MathCounts materials that
I can give to the new MathCounts coordinator.  And there were a few old
textbooks that no one wants that I could recycle.

[8] I'll muse more on Project Callisto in a week or two.

[9] I also got none of that work done Monday or Tuesday.  I'm keeping
my fingers crossed that I'll avoid distractions on Wednesday.  Of course,
I need to find those messages to deal with, but that's another issue.

My name is Sam and I'm a green alien (failures in captioning)
=============================================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), accessibility, short*

Recently, someone shared a link to a promotional video that includes
a bunch of Grinnellians [1].  I was happy to see that it was filled
with students I know, respect, and care about.  I was all set to
send a complimentary message to the folks who had made it.

Before I did so, I turned on the closed captioning.  That shouldn't
be a surprise. I often turn on closed captioning.  I do so for a
variety of reasons.  First, I'm losing a bit of my hearing, and I
find that it helps to be able to see the words.  Second, I consider
it valuable to experience videos as those who are deaf or more
hearing impaired than I would experience them.  Third, I like to
see how the video has been captioned.  I also turn on captions when
I'm watching TV, but that's usually more because my attention is
split between TV and whatever else I'm doing [2].

In any case, when I turned on the closed captioning, I wanted to
scream [3].  As far as I can tell, upon hearing that they needed
captioning, someone used some form of auto-caption tool.  But, as
we all know, auto-caption tools are often mediocre, particularly
when they deal with uncommon words or languages other than English.
This video included both and the captions were generally awful.

However, there was one bright spot.  While I generally find
auto-captioning annoying, it makes me laugh at times.  In this case,
it was when "_I'm a Grinnellian_" became "**I'm a green alien**".

I think we need stickers with that phrase [4].  It would show that
we can laugh at ourselves.  Perhaps just an `#ImAGreenalien` [5]
hashtag till do.

Something that did not make me laugh: "Y soy una Grinnelliana"
became "I saw an agony in a Liana".  Did I mention that auto-caption
rarely works when you mix languages?

A moral, in case it wasn't clear: 

> _Caption by hand, if you can.  If you can't, and choose to employ an
auto-caption, check the results before using them._

[1] I am not going to link to that video because I respect those who made
it and I am confident that they will fix the issues I raised in this video.

[2] Such as writing some of these musings.

[3] At least there is closed captioning.

[4] Perhaps I'll add it to my list of stupid but entertaining sabbatical tasks.

[5] Or perhaps `#ImAGreenAlien`.

Code triage
===========

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), gaming, short*

The other day, I received an advertisement for some "hard to find games"
[1].  I had no plan to buy any of them but I thought it would be fun to
see what they listed.  I skimmed the names.  One of them was called
*Code triage*.  My first reaction was "Boy, that's a niche game. what
percentage of board gamers care about fixing broken code? [2]"   

My next reaction was to wonder about the form of the game.  I wasn't
quite sure what it would be like, but I assumed that you would get some
borken code and have to triage it.  It could be akin to "Name that tune".

> "I can triage that code in *four days*."  "I can triage that code
in *seven hours*."  "I can triage that code in *eighteen minutes*."
"Triage that code!" [3]

It could be that you have a hand of approaches to code and you choose
one or more of them.

> "I will triage that code with *the DRY principle*".  "I will triage that
code by adding unit tests."

Or it could be that the game was a bit more basic.  Participants read
programs and generate inputs that lead to incorrect behavior.  

> "If I use an array of size `maxint`, that binary search will break."

My third reaction was to wonder about the language they used.  Would it
be Java?  C?  Visual Basic [4]?

But I was too optimistic [5].   Once I saw the cover and read [a
description](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224590/code-triage),
I realized that the game was not about code at all.  Rather it was about
triaging patients in an ER.  I guess the designers were playing off of
terms like "Code Blue" and "Code White".  But I'm pretty sure that no one
in a hospital ever says "Code Triage" or broadcasts it over the speaker
system.

Unfortunately, I'm now left wanting the game I thought Code Triage was: a
game in which players triage code.  Wouldn't that be a fun teaching tool [6]?
My biggest concern is that it seems like you could memorize the answers; we'd
need a way to generate a large enough problem set.

But I don't have time for that now.  Perhaps designing a "code triage"
game will be a task for another year.

[1] I've written previously about the number of board game mailing lists
I've ended up on.  I've removed myself from most of them, but I still
get a few.

[2] There are a lot of programmers who like board games.  But there are
certainly a lot of gamers who don't program.

[3] One version of "name that tune" that I learned involves players
bidding on how quickly they can name a tune.  I recall a parody of
that type of game from Foxtrot, the comic strip.  "I can eat that
taco with five shots of hot sauce."  My ten-second search of the
InterWeb failed to turn up that strip, but I did find [a related
one](https://www.gocomics.com/foxtrot/2002/06/27).

[4] That's too easy.  You triage Visual Basic by rewriting it in another
language.

[5] Yes, the thoughts above represent optimism.

[6] It was long ago established that my view of "fun" differs from most
people's.

Code triage
===========

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

The other day, I received an advertisement for some "hard to find games"
[1].  I had no plan to buy any of them, but I was skimming the names.
One of them was called *Code triage*.  My first reaction was "Boy,
that's a niche game. what percentage of board gamers care about fixing
broken code? [2]"   My next was to wonder about the form of the game.
I wasn't quite sure what the form was, but I assumed that you would get
some borken code and have to triage it.  It could be akin to "Name that
tune": "I can triage that code in *one hour*."  It could be you choose
some approaches to improving the code "I will triage that code with *the
DRY principle*".  It could be as simple as identifying an incorrect input
to the program.  My third was to wonder about the language they used.
Would it be Java?  C?  Visual Basic [3]?

Then I saw the cover and read [a
description](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224590/code-triage).
The game was not something of interest to me at all.  It was about
triaging patients in an ER, not code.

Now I'm left wanting the game I thought Code Triage was; a game in which
players triage code.  Wouldn't that be a fun teaching tool?  But how do
you stop people from memorizing the answers?

Oh well, designing a "code triage" game is a task for another year.

[1] I've written previously about the number of board game mailing lists
I've ended up on.  I've removed myself from most of them, but I still
get a few.

[2] There are a lot of programmers who like board games.  But there are
certainly a lot of gamers who don't program.

[3] That's too easy.  You triage Visual Basic by rewriting it in another
language.

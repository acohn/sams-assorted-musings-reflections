SamR's undergraduate workload
=============================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical], rambly [1]*

As I wrote [my recent musings about visiting the University of
Chicago](visiting-uofc-2019-12-26), I recalled that in my earlier
[musing on workload](workload-2019-12-05) I had promised to muse about
my undergraduate jobs if someone requested it, and someone did.  So,
here goes.

If I recall correctly, I worked three paid jobs and one volunteer job
as an undergraduate.  My first, and most time-consuming job, was
working at USite, the Central User's Site for computing, which, at
the time, was on the third floor of Harper Library [2].  I also served
as a teaching assistant for Calculus and, starting in my third year,
for Computer Science.  Starting in my second year or so, I served as
Shipping Chair for Doc Films.

What did each job entail?  In USite, I helped users with the computers
and the printers.  When I started, we still had a card punch and a
giant fan-fold printer.  Most of the computers were either terminals
to the giant IBM-clone mainframe made by Amdahl or IBM PCs.  Some
of the IBM terminals were especially cool in that they allowed you
to type Greek letters in addition to Roman letters; I recall using
those for learning to program graphics in APL.  We also had a bunch
of VT100s, or perhaps VT102's.  During my time there, we added
Macintosh computers, when they were released in 1984, and Laserwriters.
Replacing cartridges and paper, as well as troubleshooting, became
one of my more common tasks.

I had some of the same inclinations then that I have now.  So I spent
time learning strange markup languages [3].  I learned a bit of JCL
so that I could help folks.  And I wrote much of the USite assistant's 
guide.  I think I still have it on a floppy disk somewhere [4].

I worked multiple shifts at USite.  Usually, two shifts each week were
the graveyard shift, from midnight to 6 a.m.  I liked the graveyard
shift; there weren't a lot of people there and it tended to be the
same group of people who were there, which meant that we formed a bit
of the community.  I recall a graduate student in some social science
who was doing a bunch of number crunching when rates were lower and
who managed to convince his committee that Fortran should count as his
foreign language.  I recall going home from the shifts, making something
like garlic burgers to wake myself up, and then going to class.  I'm
still not sure when I slept on those days [5].

My work as a teaching assistant in Mathematics generally consisted of
running review sessions.  Like Grinnell's mentors and TA's, I occasionally
struggled with separating my professional and personal relationships; I
know that some of my students came to our parties.  One even sent her son
to Grinnell.

After I finished my first or second CS class, I became a teaching assistant
for computer science, too.  Strangely enough, my brain recalls that I
helped answer questions in a lab somewhere outside of Ryerson, but doesn't
recall where that lab was.

If you add up the normal workload for those three jobs, you would find that
I regularly worked much more than twenty hours each week.  At some point,
someone in administration figured that out and told me that I had to cut
out some of my responsibilities.  But cutting is hard.  I loved working
at USite; it let me play with computers [6], help people, and learn new
things.  I felt a responsibility to my Math students and to my CS students.
And so I did the only reasonable thing: I said "How about if I TA Math
as a volunteer, rather than as a paid employee?" [7].  The 
powers-that-be seemed okay with that arrangement, which suggests that their
concern was not so much with my well being as with the legal implications
of having a student work more than twenty hours per week [8].

Then we had the Pyramid incident.  For some reason, UofC liked to
buy off-brand mainframes.  We had purchased an Amdahl, rather than
an IBM.  When we went to buy a Unix box, we bought a Pyramid, rather
than a DEC.  But we had a Unix box that was used primarily for
research in Math and CS and for teaching of some upper-level CS
classes [9].  Strangely enough, we also had a DEC-20, but it was running
TOPS-20, rather than Unix.

Since the Pyramid was used for research, the Math and CS faculty
had accounts on it.  To make sure that they could install the
software they needed, most of them had root accounts.  But memorizing
a password took important mental resources, so many also had no
password.  I discovered this looking at the `/etc/passwd` file while
playing around one day.

Like any responsible student, I reported the issue.

No, that's not right.  Like any not-quite-mature undergraduate, I took
advantage of the easy access to root accounts.  I didn't do much of
import.  Mostly, I had fun creating new accounts for Hanna Holburn Gray,
president of UofC, and Harold the Chicken King, conduit of food second
only to manna from heaven [10].

My amusing hack was soon discovered.  As our sysadmin said, I "left
tracks all over the place".  Reasonably enough, the CS department
thought that I should no longer be permitted to be a TA, or at least
to be paid to TA.  I think I still ended up hanging around the lab
and helping people in any case.

So I quickly went from three paid jobs to one paid job.  But that was
okay; I'm pretty sure that my boss at USite let me pick up extra hours.
And the CS suspension was only for one semester.

More importantly, because I had volunteered to TA math, Diane
Robertson hired me to be the TA for W.H. Meyer's summer Calculus
offerings.  Meyer was the long-time Associate Chairman of Mathematics
and, among other things, was responsible for placing students in
their first course [11].  About halfway through the summer, Prof. Meyer
decided that I should develop teaching skills by teaching some class
sessions.  I don't think the students suffered much, and I began
to build my teaching skills with his advice.  I did not thank him enough 
for that.  The following summer, after I'd finished my S.B., I got to
be lead instructor.

That's most of the story of my work as an undergraduate.  I also took
classes, usually four each quarter.  I struggled at times.  I slept through
an exam in Physics, so my Physics grades were A-C-A across the three 
semesters.  I took an incomplete in Abstract Algebra.  Chicago was more
generous with incompletes than Grinnell is, so I had a year to make it
up.  I still recall rushing to finish [12].

Oh, one more thing.  As I mentioned, I also worked for Doc Films.
My primary job was Shipping Chair; I picked up the films at the
post office when they came in and shipped them out when we were
done.  It wasn't part of the Shipping Chair job, but I also ran the
projectors from time to time.  I found great satisfaction when I
managed to get the transition between reels done perfectly.  I also
got to watch a lot of movies.  One of the best parts of being in
Doc was that you got access to the keys to the Chicago film library.
The ability to watch, say, a Sam Fuller noir, a Chaplin silent
comedy, or _Singing in the Rain_ when you wanted, was a much different
experience in those pre-videotape [14] days.

What about my classes?  Well, I certainly did not work on those for
the 48-hours per week that Grinnell expects.  But I did well enough.

Beyond classes, work, and movies, I somehow found time to work on
accumulating vinyl and books, to hang with friends, to through parties,
to cook, and to do the many other things that helped shape me into me.

[1] Are all my non-trivial autobiographical musings rambly?  I'm not sure.
The two seem to go together.

[2] I see that it subsequently moved to the basement of the Crerar Library
and then [to the first floor of Crerar](https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/about/news/usite-brings-technology-closer-to-students/).  Now that CS is in Crerar
and CS labs and the Makerspace are there, I wonder whether USite still
exists.

[3] Sorry, I have no idea what the name of the markup language for the
Amdahl was.

[4] You know, the thing that looks like a physical manifestation of the
"Save" button in some programs.

[5] Michelle and some of my roommates suggest that I did not sleep those
days.  At times, I feel like I'm still catching up on that lost sleep.

[6] Getting paid to read Usenet groups was wonderful.

[7] I may have been smart, but perhaps I was not wise.

[8] At the time, I assumed it was just a stupid rule.  These days,
I understand that there are benefits issues associated with people
who work more than twenty hours.

[9] Have I mused about the Pyramid before?  I can't recall.  I'll
add it to my to-muse list.

[10] When I was a first-year student, one of the upperclassmen informed
me that "When the g-ds on Mount Olympus tire of manna, mead, and honey,
they head to Harold's".  Or something like that.

[11] Chicago had about four or five levels of Calculus.  Some
first-years could also place out of Calculus.  I recall meeting with
him after taking the placement exam and him saying something like,
"You seem to have understood the core concepts we expect from our
Calculus courses, except that you have no knowledge whatsoever of
matrices.  I will allow you to take Paul Sally's _Analysis in R^n_,
but Prof. Sally may choose to send you back to Calculus."

[12] I did not rush as much as one of Michelle's friends, who needed
to finish a dozen or so incompletes right before they graduated.

[14] Let alone those pre-DVD, pre-Blu-ray, and pre-streaming days.

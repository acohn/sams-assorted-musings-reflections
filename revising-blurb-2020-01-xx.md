As long-time readers might recall, I've been frustrated for some
time with how we measured the success of the individually advised
curriculum for our NCA/HLC [1] reviewers.  In essence, we pretended
we had different sets of fairly simplistic distribution requirements
and then checked what percentage of our graduates who met those
requirements.  We never would have done that if Brad Bateman were
still an associate Dean.

In any case, I call that approach "bean counting".  Why do I object
to the approach and even describe it with a denigrating term? Because
it fails to capture what I think of as the core concept of the
individually advised curriculum: Each student should design their own
education in consultation with a faculty advisor.

I [applied for funding to try a different
approach](innovation-fund-2019-09-27), one based on taking the declaration
of major essay much more seriously.  While I did not receive full funding,
I did receive a planning grant to explore ways to approach the project. The
announcement will be going out soon.  Now I have to make sure that I'm
happy with the blurb that will accompany the announcement.  Here's the
summary I received.

> This planning project will create a group to discuss and explore an alternative approach to supporting and assessing the success of the Individually Advised Curriculum (IAC) in ways more closely tied to Grinnell's mission statement. They may discuss ideas related to the declaration process and a curriculum retrospective that will provide information on students’ ability to ‘evaluate critically both their own and others’ ideas’ and their ability to ‘speak and write persuasively and even eloquently’.

I wonder how you pronounce "IAC".  Perhaps "yak".  It starts well.
But my goal is not so much to tie it to the mission statement as it is
to tie it to the implicit goals of the IAC.

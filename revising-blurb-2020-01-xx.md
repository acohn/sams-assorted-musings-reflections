As long-time readers might recall, I've been frustrated for some
time with how we measured the success of the individually advised
curriculum for our NCA/HLC [1] reviewers.  In essence, we pretended
we had different sets of fairly simplistic distribution requirements
and then checked what percentage of our graduates who met those
requirements.  We never would have done that if Brad Bateman were
still an Associate Dean.

In any case, I call that approach "bean counting".  Why do I object
to the approach and even describe it with a denigrating term? Because
it fails to capture what I think of as the core concept of the
individually advised curriculum: Each student should design their own
education in consultation with a faculty advisor.

I [applied for funding to try a different
approach](innovation-fund-2019-09-27), one based on taking the
declaration-of-major essay much more seriously.  While I did not
receive full funding, I did receive a planning grant to explore
ways to approach the project. The announcement will be going out
soon.  Now I have to make sure that I'm happy with the blurb that
will accompany the announcement.  Here's the draft summary I received.

> This planning project will create a group to discuss and explore
an alternative approach to supporting and assessing the success of
the Individually Advised Curriculum (IAC) in ways more closely tied
to Grinnell's mission statement. They may discuss ideas related to
the declaration process and a curriculum retrospective that will
provide information on students’ ability to ‘evaluate critically
both their own and others’ ideas’ and their ability to ‘speak and
write persuasively and even eloquently’.

I wonder how you pronounce "IAC".  Perhaps "yak".  It starts well.
But my goal is not so much to tie it to the mission statement as it is
to tie it to the implicit goals of the IAC.  Let's see what I can do.

In my customary way of writing about issues, or at least thinking about 
issues, I like to start with a problem.  

> The individually advised curriculum forms a core part of Grinnell's
liberal-arts education.  In our most recent review for accreditation
[2], we assessed the success of that curriculum quantitatively,
primarily by counting the number of courses students took in each
division.  In this planning project, we will begin to explore other
ways we might understand the success or failure of this curriculum.
[...]

Unfortunately, that does not follow the rhetorical model we are to
use.  for the blurbs.  In particular, all of the blurbs seem to
begin "In this planning project" or "In this pilot project" so I
must do the same.  I suppose the original opening isn't too bad,
at least up to the tie to the mission statement.

> This planning project will create a group to discuss and explore
alternative approaches to supporting and assessing the success of
the Individually Advised Curriculum (IAC) in ways more closely tied
to the goals of that curriculum, particularly students' understanding
of the liberal arts and their ability to design a four-year plan
that supports a liberal education.

That's a bit long.   But I like it more than "tied to the mission 
statement".  I've pulled in details of what we want beyond the
quotes from the mission statement, so I need not include them in the
next sentence.  Now on to the details.

> In contrast to the approaches used for the last reaccreditation,
which focused primarily on counting courses taken in each division,
they will explore mechanisms that require students to make explicit
their understanding of the liberal arts and the underlying design
of their four-year plans and, potentially, to defend those plans
both prospectively and retrospectively.

Yeah, that's a bit long, particularly given the prior sentence.  I
suppose I can cut the explanation from the first sentence since
it fits better in the second.  I should also do a bit of wordsmithing.

On to the next draft.

> This planning project will create a group to discuss and explore
alternative approaches to supporting and assessing the success of
Grinnell's Individually Advised Curriculum (IAC) in ways more closely
tied to our goals for the IAC.  In contrast to the approaches used
for the last reaccreditation, which focused primarily on counting
courses taken in each division, they will consider mechanisms that
require students to articulate their understanding of the liberal
arts and to argue for the success of the corresponding design of their
four-year plans.

Is that too long?  Let's see.  It's 86 words.  The old version was
seventy-five.  I wonder if I should cut some words.  Let's see how
long the others are.  The draft pilot blurbs are 85, 68, 90, 69,
67, and 70 words.  The draft planning blurbs are 92, 43, 81, 47,
89, 97, 65, and 102 words.  Did I give away too much with those
counts?  You now have an approximate count of how many projects
there are.  But I did discover that the planning projects seem to
have more words, and my length seems reasonable.  No need to cut
further!

Nonetheless, I'm tempted to edit a bit.  Let's see.

> This planning project will create a group of faculty and staff
to discuss and explore alternative approaches to supporting and
assessing the success of Grinnell's Individually Advised Curriculum
(IAC) in ways more closely tied to our goals for the IAC.  In
contrast to the approaches used for the last reaccreditation, which
focused primarily on counting courses taken in each division, they
will consider mechanisms that explicitly require students to
articulate their understanding of the liberal arts and to argue for
the corresponding design of their four-year plans.

Damn.  There's a dangling modifier in that second sentence.  At
least I think there is.  We're not contrasting the approaches with
"they", which seems to make the comparison inappropriate.  I hate
rewriting sentences like that.  I know, I'll move it to the prior
sentence, since I have "more closely tied" in that sentence.

> This planning project will create a group of faculty and staff

assessing the success of Grinnell's Individually Advised Curriculum
(IAC) in ways more closely tied to our goals for the IAC than those
used for the last reaccreditation, which focused primarily on
counting courses taken in each division.  They will likely consider
mechanisms that explicitly require students to articulate their
understanding of the liberal arts and to argue for the corresponding
design of their four-year plans.

Should I remove the section that critiques what we did last time?
Nah.  That's the whole point of the project.  Are there other changes
to consider?  Probably, but I'm not sure if I have the energy.  I
know, I'll run it through [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com).
Grammarly says 

> Overall score: 99.  We found 1 additional writing issue in this text
available only for Premium users: 1 Hard-to-read text [3].

I find that hard to believe.  In the end, I'll go with my current
assessment: it's not great, but it will do.

Next up, writing the proposal for the corresponding workshop.  Come
to think of it, next up is meeting with my partner on the project to
plan that proposal.  I'll need to schedule a meeting.

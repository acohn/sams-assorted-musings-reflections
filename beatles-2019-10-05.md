The Beatles
===========

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographal) [1]*

I was intending to post a rant today.  It's even draft.  But
yesterday, as I was posting musing #909, my muse informed me that
the one after that would have to be about the Beatles.  Why?  I'll
leave that for you to figure out [2].  But what can one write about
the Beatles that hasn't already been said?  And what can I write,
as someone who likes the Beatles, but does not have deep musical
knowledge [3]?  Sometimes my muse pushes me in strange directions.
I guess what seems best to me is to just post some vignettes of my
memories of experiences related to the Beatles.

At Eric's (?) house (down the street from Lynn, although she didn't
live there yet), hearing that the Beatles had broken up.

Getting a bunch of Beatles records that one of my mom's students
was getting rid of.  I'm pretty sure that I still have all of them,
too.  Playing them on the old KLH stereo.  I think I have that, too.
It's probably in Jonathan's room.

In some camp experience, talking with my friends about how one could
build a replacement for the Beatles, given that they weren't getting
back together.

Playing _Wings Over America_ and _Venus and Mars_ on my record player.
I can still visualize where in my room it was.  I wish we'd been able
to take the shelves from that room when mom moved out, but the realtor
said that shelves installed on the wall have to stay.  I'm sure they
just tore them down and threw them away.  I'm sure they did the same
with the amazing wall unit that my father built, too.

Getting _Meaty, Beaty, Big, and Bouncy_ and decising that even though
it was a greatest hits album, it wasn't as good as any Beatles album.
(I'm not sure that I still have that opinion.  Both _The Who Sell
Out_ and _Who's Next_ are definitely among my favorite albums.)

Enjoying stupid collectors editions of the albums; the red album on 
red vinyl, the blue album on blue vinyl, the white album on white
vinyl.  I wonder if I still have those.

Being in the Village junior year of high school and hearing that John
Lennon had been shot.

Not being able to listen to the Beatles for the next five years or so,
not because it made me sad, but because the amount of Beatles music that
was played that month put me in overload.

Singing "I saw him standing there" to William when he was just born [4].

I think that's enough for now.  I hope my muse is satistifed [5].

---

[1] No, I'm not one of the Beatles.

[2] I assume David Feldman knows.

[3] Or writing chops, for that matter.

[4] Sorry William; I hope that my singing voice didn't scar you.

[5] She seems to be.

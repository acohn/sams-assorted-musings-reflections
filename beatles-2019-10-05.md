The Beatles
===========

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical) [1]*

I was intending to post a rant today.  I even wrote a fairly
substantial draft.  But yesterday, as I was posting musing #909,
my muse informed me that the one after that would have to be about
the Beatles.  Why?  I'll leave that for you to figure out [2].  But
what can one write about the Beatles that hasn't already been said?
And what can *I* write, as someone who likes the Beatles, but does
not have deep musical knowledge [3]?  Sometimes my muse pushes me
in strange directions.  I guess what seems best to me is to just
post some vignettes of my memories of experiences related to the
Beatles.

My earliest memory of the Beatles is being at one of my best friends'
house in 1970 and hearing that the Beatles had broken up.  The scary
part is that I can't remember his name.  I think it was Eric.  I do
know that his house was across the street and down the road from
Lynn's, although she didn't live there in 1970.

My next memory is "inheriting" a bunch of Beatles records that one
of my mom's students was getting rid of.  Capitol rainbow label,
if I remember correctly.  I'm pretty sure that I still have all of
them, too.  I also remember playing all of them on my old KLH stereo [4].
I think I have that, too.  It's probably in Jonathan's room.

I remember sitting in a room in summer camp, I think in the church
across from Underwood [5], and talking to friends about how one
could put together a replacement for the Beatles, given that it
was pretty clear that they were not getting back together.

Skip forward a few years.  I remember playing _Wings Over America_,
_Band on the Run_, and and _Venus and Mars_ on my record player.
I can still visualize where in my room it was, on the stereo cabinet,
underneath the wall shelves we'd gotten from my grandfather.  I
wish we'd been able to take the shelves from that room when mom
sold the house, but the realtor said that since the shelves were
installed on the wall, they had to stay.  I'm sure that the buyers
just tore them down and threw them away.  I'm sure they did the
same with the amazing wall unit that my father built, too.  At least
I have memories.

I remember buying the Who's _Meaty, Beaty, Big, and Bouncy_ and
deciding that even though it was a greatest hits album, it wasn't
as good as any single Beatles album.  I'm not sure that I still
have that opinion.  Both _The Who Sell Out_ and _Who's Next_ are
definitely among my favorite albums.

I recall enjoying stupid collectors editions of the albums; the
red album on red vinyl, the blue album on blue vinyl, the white
album on white vinyl.  I wonder if I still have those.

I remember sitting in the Village [6] in my junior year of high school
and hearing that John Lennon had been shot.  Everyone was in shock.

One of the side effects of that was that I didn't really feel able
to enjoy the Beatles for the next five years or so.  It's not because
it made me sad. Rather, it's that the amount of Beatles music that
was played that month put me in overload.

Skip forward a few more years, and I recall singing "I saw him
standing there" to William when he was just born [7].  I sang it
to him in the room with Michelle.  I also sang it to him in the
apartment in Waterville.

I think that's enough for now.  I hope my muse is satisfied [8].
I also hope she'll rethink her choices the next time she decides
to force me to impose random memories on you and myself [9].  At
least she got to make her joke, and there would not be an opportunity
to do so.

[1] No, I'm not one of the Beatles.

[2] I assume David Feldman knows.

[3] Or writing chops, for that matter.

[4] Were KLH stereos ever good?  I'm not sure.  I still enjoyed it.

[5] Underwood elementary school, not Underwood Deviled Ham.

[6] The Village was a school-within-a-school in my too-large high
school.  For some reason, I recall that Summerhill principles were
at play, but I could be wrong.

[7] Sorry William; I hope that my singing voice didn't scar you.

[8] She seems to be.

[9] I'm not sure.

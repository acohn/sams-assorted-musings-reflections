Wayne State recently released its [annual list of words it would
like to see
revived](https://today.wayne.edu/news/2020/01/06/wayne-state-word-warriors-release-2020-list-35098),
words that were once popular, but have fallen into disuse.  Here's
the list.  You can refer to the article I linked for definitions.

> Cachinnate, Coruscate, Gewgaw, Luculent, Mullock, Perendinate, Redolent,
Seriatim, Somnambulant, Velleity

I knew three of the words: Gewgaw [1], Redolent, and Somnambulant.  I hadn't
realized that any were in such disfavor.  I feel like I see things like
"The wine is redolent of berries and spice" fairly regularly.  But maybe
it's that I read pretentious things.  I spend enough of my time somnambulant
that it seems I hear it regularly.  For some reason, I associate "gewgaw"
with stories about the U.S. South.

But the rest?  I suppose I'd heard some of them before [2].  But they do
seem like words that are used infrequently at best.

I'm happy to learn "Perendinate", a type of procrastination, since I
do procrastinate a lot.  However, I'm not sure that I understand the
definition or example used.  Here's what they have.

> **Perendinate** - To procrastinate a long time, especially two days.

> He received the order a month ago but perendinated on the work until 48 hours before the deadline. 

First of all, two days is not a long time.  I've procrastinated on some
things for a full semester, if not more.  In addition, there's a big
difference between procrastinating for two days and procrastinating until
two days before something is due.  It sounds like the person in the example
perendinated for twenty-eight or twenty-nine days [3].

Let's see if I can find another definition.  [Here's a good one](https://wordsmith.org/words/perendinate.html), taken from _A.Word.A.Day_ with Anu Garg.

> **perendinate**

> *Pronunciation*

> (puh-REN-di-nayt)

> *Meaning*

> * verb tr. : To put off until the day after tomorrow.

> * verb intr.: To stay at a college for an extended time.

> *Etymology*

> From Latin _perendinare_ (to defer until the day after tomorrow), from _perendie_ (on the day after tomorrow), from _dies_ (day).

> *Notes*

> The word procrastinate is from Latin *cras* (tomorrow). So when you procrastinate, literally speaking, you are putting something off till tomorrow. Mark Twain once said, "Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow." In other words, why procrastinate when you can perendinate?

> *Usage*

> "In Peterhouse the Master and Fellows might not allow a stranger to perendinate for more than a fortnight unless they were certified of his moral character and of his ability and willingness to do the College some notable service."
Thomas Alfred Walker; Peterhouse; Hutchinson & Co.; 1906. 

Yes, that's much better.  I drafted this musing on Tuesday.  If I
were to perendinate posting I would not post until Thursday.  But
I think I'll just procrastinate, since I have another musing planned
for Thursday.

What about that other meaning?  If I started at Grinnell in 1997, can
I say that I've perendinated at Grinnell?  And where does that meaning
come from, in any case?

Postscript: Given that it's Wayne State, you would have thought that one
of their words would have to deal with dysfunctional Boards of Governors
or overly intrusive trustees.  But what do I know?

[1] Which I dislike.

[2] It helps to work with John Stone.

[3] Or, if it's February, twenty-six or twenty-seven days.

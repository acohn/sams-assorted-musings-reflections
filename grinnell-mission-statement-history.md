A history of Grinnell's mission statement
=========================================

In [a recent essay](grinnell-mission-statement) I wrote about Grinnell's
mission statement and how it inspires me as a faculty member.  Just in
case you've forgotten, here it is again.

> When Grinnell College framed its charter in the Iowa Territory of the
United States in 1846, it set forth a mission to educate its students "for
the different professions and for the honorable discharge of the duties
of life." The College pursues that mission by providing an education in
the liberal arts through free inquiry and the open exchange of ideas. As
a teaching and learning community, the College holds that knowledge is a
good to be pursued both for its own sake and for the intellectual, moral,
and physical well-being of individuals and of society at large. The
College exists to provide a lively academic community of students
and teachers of high scholarly qualifications from diverse social and
cultural circumstances. The College aims to graduate individuals who can
think clearly, who can speak and write persuasively and even eloquently,
who can evaluate critically both their own and others' ideas, who can
acquire new knowledge, and who are prepared in life and work to use
their knowledge and their abilities to serve the common good.

You may be wondering where this wonderful mission statement came from.
It was written by a committee of faculty members in about 2001

So, where did this mission statement come from.  Well, in about 2001,
the Trustees of Grinnell College decided that we needed a new mission
statement.  Here's what they came up with as a starting point [3].

> **Core Principles**

> * Close collaboration between students and faculty in a residential college setting brings the liberal arts to life.
> * Excellence involves mastering the fundamentals while welcoming innovation.
> * Mutual respect and individual responsibility guide relationships among students, faculty, and staff in a diverse, supportive community.
> * Achievement through leadership and service to others marks our personal and professional endeavors.

> **Purpose**
Grinnell College educates citizens and leaders for our communities, the nation, and the world by preparing them to pursue successful careers, satisfying personal lives, effective community service, and active leisure.

> **Present Goal**

> To be the liberal arts college of choice for those who are committed
to academic excellence and a spirit of public service. >

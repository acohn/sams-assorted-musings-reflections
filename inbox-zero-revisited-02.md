Inbox zero, revisited, stage two
================================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email), technology, frustrations*

Yesterday, I finished my attempt at cleaning out the mailbox by declaring
"inbox bankruptcy" and moving all of my email from my inbox to a folder
that I called "___Inbox bankruptcy 2018-06-30".  Unfortunately, I got
to experience the wonderful interaction of Mail.app and an Exchange
server.  In particular, aftery copying a few of the messages, Mail.app 
freaked out and gave up.  "I'm sorry, something went wrong moving your
messages."  

What did that mean?  No messages were in my inbox.  Very few of the 11K
messages I was moving were in the bankruptcy folder.  Where were they?
It appears that they were put in the "Recovered Messages" folder.  But
what did the Exchange server think?  It seems to think that none of the
messages were moved.  Did I ever mention that I hate computers?  I tried
moving some messages from "Recovered Messages" to the bankruptcy folder.
But Outlook continued to think they were in the inbox.  That was a bad
strategy.

My next approach was to switch Macs.  But you'll remember that I had
just dealt with something like 30,000 messages.  Once again, the wonder
of Macs and Exchange came into play.  Rather than reading the changes
as moves, it reads them as deletions and new messages.  So I got to
sit and watch a message that said something like "Downloading Mesages:
15,681 new messages" slowly count down [1,2].

[1] Or, at times, not count down at all.

[2] And the 15,681 is a small number.  It went up to 28,667 later.  After
two hours it was at "9,557 of 30,447".  I let it run overnight.

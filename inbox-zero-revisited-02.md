Inbox zero, revisited, stage two
================================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email), technology, frustrations*

Yesterday, I finished my attempt at cleaning out the mailbox by declaring
"inbox bankruptcy" and moving all of my email from my inbox to a folder
that I called "___Inbox bankruptcy 2018-06-30".  Unfortunately, I got
to experience the wonderful interaction of Mail.app and an Exchange
server.  In particular, aftery copying a few of the messages, Mail.app 
freaked out and gave up.  "I'm sorry, something went wrong moving your
messages."  

What did that mean?  No messages were in my inbox.  Very few of the 11K
messages I was moving were in the bankruptcy folder.  Where were they?
It appears that they were put in the "Recovered Messages" folder.  But
what did the Exchange server think?  It seems to think that none of the
messages were moved.  Did I ever mention that I hate computers?  I tried
moving some messages from "Recovered Messages" to the bankruptcy folder.
But Outlook continued to think they were in the inbox.  That was a bad
strategy.

My next approach was to switch Macs.  But you'll remember that I had
just dealt with something like 30,000 messages.  Once again, the wonder
of Macs and Exchange came into play.  Rather than reading the changes
as moves, it reads them as deletions and new messages.  So I got to
sit and watch a message that said something like "Downloading Mesages:
15,681 new messages" slowly count down [1,2].

In the end, I ended up with a bit over 12,000 messages in my inbox.  To
avoid the issue of "Whoops! I couldn't move your messages; they are now
in limbo", I'm moving a month at a time.  June 2018 went fine.  May
2018 went fine.  April 2018 froze after it had moved 500 messages.  I'm
not sure what I should do about that.  I'll wait and see.  

So, how many messages had accumulated between about 11:00 p.m. at night
when I stopped and 8:30 a.m., when I checked back in?  A bit over thirty.
What kinds of messages do I receive on a Saturday night and Sunday morning?  
The newest was a reply to one of the late replies I mentioned yesterday,
the one about my office at UIowa.  "No worries; we worked things out."  A
message from Facebook that someone posted to a group I watch.  I'm not sure
how I ended up watching a group.  The feature is sometimes useful.  I'm
not going to figure out how to turn it off yet.

One conference announcement from
Common Ground Research Networks, potentially affiliated with the University
of Illinois.  But it's not really related to what I do.  And look, there's
an unsubscribe button.  One fewer set of thigns to get.  A Change.org
petition.  Should I unsubscribe from the Change.org petititions?  Given
how hard it is to keep my mailbox empty, the answer has to be "Yes".
Oh, this is fun.  They're forcing me to log in to unsubscribe.  But I
don't remember my password.  And I refuse to connect my Facebook.  So
I get to reset my password and wait for that message.  Wow; I've been
a Change.org member for six years.  That's okay; I don't need their
emails.  My friends send along appropriate petititions.

What about the advertisements?  Should I tell you what they are?  It
probably says something about me.  *Amazon* sends me a list of daily Kindle
sales.  I'll keep receiving that.  I got on the *Fry's* mailing list at
some point.  Unsubscribe.  *Biaggi's*?  They only send me a message every
few weeks and, once every year or so, it's an announcement of a really
cool dinner opportunity.  I'll stay on that list.  *Living Social*?  I
should unsubscribe.  But every six months or so, I see a deal that I want
to use.  It's saved us money on escape room adventures for the kids at
least twice.  But the time to ignore the messages is also costly.
Unsubscribe.  *Bed, Bath, and Beyond*?  I'm not quite sure how I ended up
on their mailing list; probably a present I ordered for someone.  Ooh ...
they are good marketers "We can just send you coupons and sale announcements."
That's only a few times a month.  No.  It's not worth it.  If I really
care about such advertisements, I such set up a separate account that I
only check when I want to order something or have time.  *Packt publishing*?
I'm pretty sure that they published a book by one of our alumni.  And they
have cool sales.  But I don't need more books, physical or electronic.
Unsubscribe.  *Pop Market*?  I feed my desire for music every few months
from one of their sales.  It's also a way to hear about some new releases
without a lot of overhead.  But no, I don't need more music.  Unsubscribe.

What's left?  A message from Amazon that Michelle bought a Kindle book.
Daily comic strips.  I should probably either start reading the daily comic 
strips I receive or stop subscribing.  I"m going to leave that as an issue
for another day.  A digest from the Council on Undergraduate Research.  I'm
tempted to leave their two mailing lists, but that's another task for 
another day.  My daily "Todoist digest".  I never read those.  Is it
worth the few minutes to figure out how to stop it?  Yes.  A daily news
digest from _The Washington Post_.  Seeing a bit of the news is good for
me.  I'll keep that.  One two three four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen! messages from the Internet Society's Internet
Policy mailing list.  I almost never get email from the Internet Society.
I wonder if I accidentally added a mailing list when I was doing cleanup
yesterday; I think they'd sent me a "please confirm our privacy settings"
message and I said to myself "I should hear more from them".  But this
is too much more.  EFF tells me about important policy issues, as
does the RISKS digest.  My students and family tell me about others.
I should unsubscribe from this new list.  But I need to log in.  And I
don't know my password.  A few minutes of fiddling and I'm unsubscribed.

What arrived while I was processing those messages?  We'll start
with the advertisements.  Another *Fry*'s advertisement.  Let's hope
my unsubscribe sticks.  Another note from *Pop Market*.  Same.
An advertisement from *Lands' End*.  I should probably unsubscribe.
But those advertisements are easy to handle and my long-term purchasing
is affiliated with this email address.  I'll delete the message but keep
the subscription.  A digest from *Costco*.  That falls under the rubric
of "Should unsubscribe but won't."  Something from *Heritage Auctions*.
I haven't bid on something there for years.  But they occasionally have
really cool auctions; I think I joined when they were doing an auction
of comic strips done in honor of Richard Thompson (the cartoonist, not
the musician).  Subw [3].  *Stack Social*.  They sometimes have really
good software sales; I'm pretty sure that's how I ended up with Camtasia
for only $20.00.  Subw.  *BookBub*.  Another set of Kindle sales.  I
don't really need more Kindle books.  But I'm an addict.  And at least
Kindle books don't take up space.  And look, today's first one is a set
of books by Greg Bear that I'd like to read [4].  Subw.

Beyond the advertisement?  The daily digest from Cracked.com.  Cracked.com
gives me the occasional good distraction when I need it.  Keep.
The daily digest from Salon.com.  I need my daily news from the left
[5].  Salon has [an interesting article about the defeat of Crowley by
Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.salon.com/2018/07/01/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sends-shockwaves-through-the-democratic-party-will-it-learn-the-lesson/).
I'm not sure that I agree with their conclusions; urban democrats
don't represent the county.  But it was worth reading.  And perhaps there's
another important thing to note: A tendency on both sides to vote for
someone who will shake things up, as it were, rather than for someone who
has good principles and is in a likely position of power [7].  Today's
_Salon.com_ also has a commentary on [the Annapolis shooter's links to the
alt-right](https://www.salon.com/2018/06/30/exclusive-accused-annapolis-shooter-had-deep-dark-links-to-the-alt-right/).  I don't like the alt-right.  But
I think blaming them in this case just exacerbates the divide [8].

Eventually, I also got "You've successfully unsubscribed" messages
from Fry's, the weird conference, and, um, nothing else.

[1] Or, at times, not count down at all.

[2] And the 15,681 is a small number.  It went up to 28,667 later.
After two hours it was at "9,557 of 30,447".  I guess the 30K makes
sense; that's about how many messages I'd imoved around.  In any case,
I let it run overnight.

[3] Should unsubscribe but won't.

[4] Don't worry, MIchelle, I'm not buying them.  My reading list is
currently much too large.

[5] I realize that many people consider _The Washington Post_ and _The
New York Times_ news from the left.  But compared to _Salon.com_, they
are fairly centrist [6].  

[6] No, that's not the same as saying "Compared to Sam, they are fairly thin."
There are many things much more leftist than Salon.com.

[7] Salon says Crowley "was positioned for the No. 2 or No. 3 post
in Congress"

[8] I'm not saying that the article blames the alt-right; it just links
the shooter.

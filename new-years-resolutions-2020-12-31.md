It's the last day of the year 2020 [1].  Since most people make
New Year's resolutions on the last day of the year, my muse has
suggested that I muse about what my resolutions might be for the
year.  I'm not big on resolutions; my experience is that too often
I need to break them.  But that doesn't mean I can't set goals
for the year.  Let me see.

* I will try to write more, at least at the points that I have time
  to write.
* When I write, I will do my best to listen to my muse [2] and
  to follow her [3] advice.
* I will try to read more, at least at the points that I have time
  to read.  Will reading take priority over writing?  Will writing
  take priority over reading?  I'm not sure.
* When I read, I will try to focus more on longer works, rather than
  the newspaper articles I normally read in the evening [4].
* Since I was expecting to be an empty-nester this year, I will try
  to embrace the additional time I have with my offspring (and Michelle,
  but that's a given).
* I will continue to try to be thankful for the many wonderful things
  in my life.
* I will try to pay better attention to my mental, emotional, and
  physical well-being.  Among other things, that means I will work
  on checking with my advisory panel, on saying "No" before I check
  with my advisory panel, and on realizing my limits.  I've been
  doing better this fall.  I've certainly been finding it helpful
  to apply a version of the serenity prayer to my work, such as to
  IT policy [6].

Yeah, that's more than enough.  Vague goals.  All about "trying".
Mostly interrelated (e.g., reading and writing will help with my
mental well being, reading gives me things to write about).  Things
that should be achievable (as opposed to, say, making significant
progress on my lab or basement [7]).

[1] At least the year they call 2020 in most Western societies.  There
are, of course, older calendars and other dating systems.

[2] Or muses.

[3] Their.

[4] I will likely continue reading _Chronicle_ and _Inside Higher
Ed_ in the morning [5].

[5] Or whatever you call it when I wake up at 4 a.m. and need to go back
to sleep.

[6] "G-d grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the
difference."  I've also added a "within reasonable limits" to the
"things I can [change]".

[7] That doesn't mean that I won't try.  I'll just be okay if I don't
get it all done [8].

[8] Yes, Micki, I will get the stuff out of the family room.

Should I buy grammarly premium?  
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Meta musings](index-meta), language, technology, short.*

Recently, I received an advertisement for Grammarly Premium for $75 for
a year, or about $6.50 per month.  I use the free version of Grammarly 
every day.  They probably deserve some compensation.  But I had bad
experiences with the grammarly premium when I tried it; I disagreed with
a lot of its advice.  Of course, disagreeing with it leads to some fun
musings.  And if I'm paying for it, I could complain or request features.
("I use British-style punctuation.  Can you stop complaining about where
I put periods?")

Should I buy grammarly premium?  
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Meta musings](index-meta), language, technology, short.*

Recently, I received an advertisement for
[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) Premium for $75 for a year,
or about $6.50 per month.  I use the free version of Grammarly daily.
Now, Grammarly is not perfect.  It's not close.  I disagree with about
half of the recommendations it makes [1].  I might even do better
copying and pasting into Microsoft Word [2].  But it does make some
useful recommendations.  And, as importantly, it gets me to look a bit
more closely at what I've written.

If I'm using Grammarly daily, the folks at the company probably deserve
some compensation.  But I had bad experiences with Grammarly Premium
the last time I tried it; I disagreed with a lot of its advice [3].
And do I really want to pay for incorrect advice?

Of course, disagreeing with it leads to some fun musings [4].  

And if I'm paying for it,
I could complain or request features.  ("I use British-style punctuation.
Can you stop complaining about where I put periods?")

---

[1] I've heard my colleagues in English suggest that Grammarly is not
a good tool for inexperienced writers because one needs to know enough
about English grammar to disagree with Grammarly's recommendations

[2] Probably not.  But that's a good topic to explore in the future

[3] More precisely, "A lot of its advice was wrong."

[4] The musings are fun for me.  They may not be fun for you.

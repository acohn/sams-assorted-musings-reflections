In the middle of April 2016, I had an idea.  A whim, perhaps.  I
had a lot of things I wanted to write.  I needed to explain to some
students why [I was not intervening on their behalf](contacting-faculty).
I had received a variety of questions about [what kind of computer
prospective CS majors should buy](buy-computer) and [the benefits
of studying CS at a small liberal arts college](lac-vs-university)
and had "write a response" on my to-do list.  I was upset about
[the termination of Grinnell's relationship with
Posse](posse-termination-revisited) and needed to get my thoughts
in order.  I decided that I'd put them together on a Web site.  That
way, I could get comments from others and could easily point to
them when someone asked me a question.  "Why should I study CS?"
Oh, that's easy, [read this](why-study-cs).  "Why should I take a
faculty position in your department?"  There are [so many good
reasons](teaching-cs-at-grinnell).

At least that's what I recall.  I see that [one of my early musings
was on the genesis of the musings](genesis). It appears that I had
been visiting some peer institutions with Middle and wanted
to provide some notes to our office of admissions on things I set
Grinnell apart positively.  In that early musing, I claimed that
the musings were a way to keep my writing in check.  I see that I
also wanted to provide an archive of "what I think about" for my
kids; I know I appreciate the packet of mom's writings that is
currently lost somewhere in the house.

Like many of my projects, it seems to have spun out of control.
Although I wrote "I'll admit that I have some concerns about what
will happen after I get through the first thirty or so 'natural'
topics", I've posted one thousand essays, musings, rants, and the
like [1].  And I have a few hundred more on the list of topics I
might write about.  I guess my estimation skills need some work
[2].

Your estimation skills might suggest to you that if I were posting
a musing each day, I would have reached number one thousand a bit
before today.  And you'd be right.  But I've had periods in which
I did not feel up to posting daily.  I've also had some long periods
in which I did not feel like posting at all.  Nonetheless, I've 
continued to make progress, and here we are at number 1000.

One thousand posts represent about a half year of full-time work
[3].  Was it a good use of that much time?  I think so.  I learn
when I write.  I enjoy writing.  Once in a while, I seem to write
something that makes a positive difference to other people or at
least that resonates with other people. So yes, it seems that it's
worth my time [4].

If I'd realized that I was going to write this many musings, I would
have built a better infrastructure.  I've certainly added to it
over time, including multiple indices, software for processing the
endnotes [5], Bootstrap styling, Hypothes.is annotations, a custom
of adding tags to the start of musings, and other things I've likely
forgotten.  I suppose it would be better if I'd thought about all of
that at the beginning, but I didn't.  These days, I'm working on
incorporating Jekyll-like [6] page information that I can more easily
extract when I want other features.

But I guess I wouldn't have predicted all of those needs at the
start.  I should have thought about how one should organize
a few thousand files.  Having everything in one directory with a
Makefile may not be the best strategy [7].  At some point, I'll
find a way to reorganize it all.

I've never really written for a particular audience. And I write
about enough different things that I'm not sure that any one audience
can appreciate all.  Folks at Grinnell tend to appreciate [9] my
thoughts on governance and other issues at Grinnell, but they are
unlikely to know about the technical issues I discuss.   Other
computer scientists might appreciate my occasional comments on
teaching CS but probably don't care about what happens at Grinnell.
My family may like my autobiographical comments; perhaps a few
friends read them, too.  I'm not sure who cares about my whining
about my workload.  

Two folks have commented on my musings from the start, more-or-less:
Michelle Rebelsky and David Feldman '71.  Michelle knew me already.
At least I hope she did.  We'd been married nearly thirty years at
that point.  I knew of David Feldman, mostly through his Imponderables
books [10]. He discovered me because of my now-deleted musing on the
Posse program.  I still haven't figured out why he continues to
read, but I appreciate it.  My kids also read it but only comment
to me behind the scenes [11].

Of course, I also get comments from old friends, alumni, and colleagues.
So I have a variety of readers.

But I'm pretty sure that some musings have a broader readership.
On occasion, a colleague who is not a Facebook friend notes that
they appreciated a recent musing.  Some students tell me they've
read them [12].  Some folks share them on [Everyday Class
Notes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/afterpants/), but I have no
idea how people respond there.  I know a few staff members read
them, but I don't know how many.  Oh well.  In the end, I write for
myself and for my family.

At this point, I find that I'm repeating myself a bit.  I complain
about the changes to the Web site [15].  I complain about what was
done to the book store and how it violated shared governance.  I
reflect on self-governance.  I whine about my workload.  Stuff like
that.

I also find that I often forget what I've written.  Sometimes I
write about something and then discovered I'd written about it
already.  I even forgot that [I already mused about forgetting what
I've written](forgetting-musings).

Has musing helped improve my writing?  I had hoped it would, and I
like to think so.  I've certainly developed a style or a voice.  As
my Theatre Professor would suggest, these musings are one of the
ways I perform in public [16].  However, there are also times that
I feel my writing has gotten worse.  I think, for example, of the
sequence of speeches I wrote for Duke TIP. The first one was the
best of the three.  I suppose there's a lesson in that; something
like, "Stop when it's good enough."

After this many musings, I find that I have a compulsion to write.
I had never quite understood what writers meant when they said
something like that. But I feel incomplete when I don't write.  More
importantly, things to write about keep coming to mind.  And I learn
when I write about things.  So I'm going to keep writing, musing,
and ranting.

Thanks for reading!

**_Postscript_**: I had hoped to include some statistics about my
musings here but I ran out of time.  Perhaps I'll gather some
data before musing 2000.

[1] I was going to say "I've written 1000", but I've written a few more
than that.

[2] My students say that about my estimation skills for homework
assignments.

[3] See [the prior musing](naming-musing-1000) for an explanation
of that estimate.

[4] Maybe a little less of my time.

[5] Those endnotes have certainly become a key part of my writing 
style.

[6] Or liquid-like.

[7] I will admit that Makefiles are my hammer for software design [8].

[8] "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

[9] Or object to.

[10] Those books got Michelle through residency.

[11] "Dad, here's a list of a dozen misspellings, grammatical errors,
and stylistic issues in your latest musing.  Oh, wait, those are just
the ones from the first paragraph of your latest musing."

[12] My favorite comment: I read your musings.  I saw that you linked
to some of your mother's writing.  She's a much better writer [14].

[14] Yes, she is.

[15] And, these days, an appreciative note about sites.grinnell.edu.

[16] I tend to claim that my classroom is my primary performance space.

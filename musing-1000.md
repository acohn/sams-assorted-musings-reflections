Started on a whim.  Thought it would be good to post a few of the things
I was writing. Explanations of policies.  Responses to common email.
Letters to the editor that I wouldn't send, but wanted public.  That kind
of thing.

Wasn't sure who my audience was.  For some things, it was just "If I have
the document somewhere, I can point people to it."  Assumed a few friends
and a few students would read.

Also didn't really realize that it would become a habit.  

Should have planned better.

Find that I'm repeating myself.  Web site.  Book store.  Self-gov.
Whining about my workload.  Stuff like that.  

Forget what I've written.  Even forgot that I already mused about
forgetting what I've written.

Helped improve my writing, or at least I think it helped improve my
writing.  At times, I feel like I write worse.  Certainly, it feels
like my sequence of speeches to  Duke TIP students got worse, rather
than better.

But I learn from writing.  These days, that's probably the most important
reason I muse.

Other reasons: Tells my kids more about me.  I know that I value my
mom's writings when I stumble upon them.  I hope that these will be of
value to my kids after I'm gone.

These days, I feel a compulsion to write.  I had never understood what
writers meant when they said something like that. But I feel incomplete
when I don't write.  And things to write about keep coming to mind.

The Rebelsky family does a variety of things when we get together.  We
talk.  We eat.  We sometimes watch TV or bury our heads in computers.
But we also play games.  No, not video games [1]; card games and tabletop
games.

What did we play during this holiday break?  I'm not sure I can list
everything, but I thought I'd try to list a few highlights and comment
on a few of the games.

We started the break playing [_The Great
Dalmuti_](great-dalmuti-2019-12-20) and we played a number of games
over the course of break.  If I recall correctly, we started with a
three-player game, but mostly played with five players.

Over the next few days, we pulled out some games that were in the "We
haven't played this yet; we should"

Started with [_Raccoon Tycoon_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254386/raccoon-tycoon).  No Michelle.  But I think she posted pictures of us playing.
Like the choice of options.  Looking forward to the expansion which I
supported on Kickstarter.

Also played [Hornet]

The next night, we played
[_Wingspan_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan)
with Michelle.  _Wingspan_ has gotten a lot of press of late and,
since it went out of print, was commanding suprisingly high prices.
I managed to snag a reasonably priced copy when it came back into
print.  I can see why it's popular.  It's a pretty game.  It also
has a reasonable level of complexity [2].  And, like _Raccoon
Tycooon_, it's a kind of game in which you must decide between
multiple options in each turn (get food, attract a bird, get some
eggs, or get more potential bird cards).  It's from Stonemaier games,
which tends to make nice games.

A night or two after that, we played [_Lords of
Xidit_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156566/lords-xidit).
If I recall correctly, I picked it up a few years ago after reading
a review of the new version of [_Robo
Rally_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/216201/robo-rally) which
suggested that _Lords of Xidit_ was a much better programming game
[3,4].  But _Xidit_ doesn't have all of the wonderful chaos that
happens in _Robo Rally_.  On the other hand, it also doesn't feel
nearly as interminable as [The Original _Robo
Rally_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally) [5].  And,
in its own way, _Xidit_ had a similar "choose between options" feel;
do you gather fighters, fight monsters, or keep your fighters in
hopes of getting bonuses?

On New Year's Eve, we invited folks over for games [6].  I'm not
sure of everything that got played.  I started with [The Crazy
Creatuers of Dr.
Doom](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119193/crazy-creatures-dr-doom)
because it seemed like a good, light, game to play while waiting
for people to arrive.  Once we had more than a few, we went to our
common fallback for "What to do when some people have arrived, but
not most", [_Dixit_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit).
I learned about _Dixit_ from Jill Schrift in Studio Art, who used
to have her students draw new cards for it.  It's a wonderful light
game of clues and guessing, in which you try to get some other
people, but not everyone, to guess your card.

More people came in while we were playing _Dixit_ and started playing
[_We Didn't Playtest This At All_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31016/we-didnt-playtest-all), a short, chaotic game with ever-changing rules and
another one of our getting-started go-to games [7].

[_Pandemic_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic)
in one room.
[_Alchemists_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161970/alchemists) and
then [_Betrayal at House on the Hill_] in the other.

And, as you'd guess, _The Great Dalmuti_ came out multiple times.  I think
it started in one room and then moved to another.  [_Bananagrams_] seemed
to get played, too.

There were only a few days left after New Year's.  Middle left.  Youngest
had studying to do.  But Eldest, Michelle, and I managed to get a few
games of [

---

[1] Well, everyone but me plays _Pokemon Go_ and some of the boys play
MMORPGs and other computer games.

[2] For example, Michelle could learn it relatively quickly.

[3] Programming games are games in which you must specify a sequence
of moves in advance from a limited set.

[4] I also picked up [_Mechs vs
Minions_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209010/mechs-vs-minions)
at about the same time, based on the same review.  Yes, that's right,
the review listed it as a much better programming-based game.

[5] In contrast, _Mechs vs Minions_ does have some of the same chaos.
I'm pretty sure the reviewer was right; it's a better game.  And the
miniatures are great.

[6] Unlike Reindeer Games, Rebelsky Games are inclusive.

[7] It's perfect for that purpose.  I'm not sure why it gets such a low
rating on Board Game Geek.

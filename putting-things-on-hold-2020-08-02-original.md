No, I'm not really back from being [on hiatus from
musing](on-hiatus-2020-07-23).  However, my muse insisted that I
write a followup to help me manage my sanity.  Think of it as a
kind of appendix to that musing.

I spent twelve hours working on department matters yesterday
(Saturday).  I started at 7am.  I stopped at 7pm.  Never mind.  I
didn't stop at 7pm.  But I eased back on my work at 7pm, mixing
work with family TV watching.  Most of my work had to do with
software policy at Grinnell, particularly [the new guidance on the
software review
process](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/IT/SitePages/The%20Software%20Review%20Process.aspx)
[1].  I should not be spending my weekends on that work.  Given the
week I just had, I should not be spending my weekends on any work.

I'm done.  I can't spend the time on that kind of work anymore.
Classes start in three weeks.  While there are a host of issues of
broad concern that I spend time on, I cannot do so anymore.  It's
not just that I cannot write about them anymore.  It's just that
I can't spend the mental energy on them.  I guess it's time to make
a list.  It's in no particular order; just the order things came
to mind.

1. Support my Tutorial students in selecting courses and in the
registration process.  **Prioritize**.  Registration for first years
is next week.

2. Support my returning advisees in handling their fall courses.
**Prioritize**.

3. Read, attempt to comprehend, and respond to software policy on
campus.  **Place on hold.**  I know it feels like others aren't
paying close attention.  I know that my colleagues in the department
want me to prioritize this.  But I can't spend the time or effort
anymore.

4. List all the software I rely on in my everyday work (teaching,
research, service, life).  **Place on hold.**  I'll need to cross
my fingers that ITS will not really expect me to check on all this
software.

5. Participate in discussions about balancing support for our
students, particularly our students of color, while also supporting
faculty.  **Place on hold.** There's too much anger.  Others are
discussing this matter.  I'll leave it to them.  But for those who
did not understand my prior musing: _I do not believe that **anyone**
should say the n-word in class._ However, I do believe that there
are reasons to use the word in our classes, such as when faculty
in literature or sociology or the arts select readings or songs or
videos or ....  We should find ways to build inclusive classrooms,
using strategies like Dean B's inclusive syllabus.  Although I am
placing this activity, I will participate in a discussion that one
colleague requested.

6. Prepare my tutorial.  **Prioritize**.

7. Work on preparing CSC 151.  **Prioritize**.  Of course, this is
difficult to prioritize given that I don't know what software we
can use [3].  But PM and I can make general plans.  And I can work
more on some of the trouble spots.

8. Participate in the COOL class.  **Unclear**.  I'd like to prioritize
this course.  But so much stuff has been thrown my way and it's
getting too close to classes.

9. Move [my www.cs.grinnell.edu
site](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/).  **Darn!**   I'd
prefer not to prioritize this.  But it needs to be done by the start
of classes, if not sooner.

10. Move and rebuild [the www.cs.grinnell.edu
site](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu).  **Darn!**  I'd prefer not to
prioritize this.  But the site has been on hiatus since last fall,
when ITS took a snapshot.  The data are out of date.  The design
is out of date.  We need to do something.  There are also broader
issues at play, but I will not rant about them here.

11. Continue reporting on the security, privacy, and FERPA violations
I observe.  **Place on hold**.  Let someone else do it.

12. Oppose repeated incursions on faculty governance.  **Place on
hold; consider giving up**. Let someone else do it.  I'm happy to
generate and share my list if anyone asks [4], but I will no longer
raise issues as they occur.  I've also accepted that it's an
increasingly complex issue: I believe we need to better support
staff governance; doing so may mean giving up some faculty authority
[5,6].

13. [7] Challenge Council's critiques of my department.  **Place
on hold**.  I've asked folks to discuss them with my colleagues.
It's off my plate.  But at some time, I'll need to step back up.
Or maybe not; it may be yet another task that consumes my time and
produces no useful results.

14. Reflect on stepping down as chair.  **Place on hold**.  I'm not
sure that anyone can do a better job right now, particularly given
the prior entry.  Right now, it feels like being chair will eventually
damage not only my ability to do the work I most value but also my
psyche.  Maybe by putting enough things on hold, I can fix that.
And, hey, maybe someone will insist that I step down.

15. Work on diversity issues in CS.  **Prioritize**.  First priority:
Meet about GHC (Monday morning).  Next priority: Select a book for
the department reading group.

16. Research project.  **Place on hold.**  My MAP is done.  I've
completed the individual student reports.  I've completed the exit
interviews.  I've reported the grades.  My students are awesome.
I found funding for a few to continue for the next two weeks.  I
can trust them to continue moving MIST forward.  I'll be available
on demand, but that's it.

17. Home and family.  **Prioritize** and then **Prioritize again**.
I'll talk to them about how best to do so.  And I'll need to figure
out why this didn't appear until magic number 17.  Most likely,
because it does not reflect the stress on my life and the things
above do.

18. Respond to micro- and macro-aggressions.  **Place on hold**.  They
build.  They build more.  But responding doesn't seem to help.  Maybe
I'll make a list instead.  I need a way for them not to fester [8].

19. Comment on assorted absurdities.  **Place on hold**.  Does anyone
but me care that you can't find the THRIVE principles?  Probably not.

20. Explore software problems.  **Place on hold**.  Everyone else seems
to be able to ignore them.  Why can't I?  Does it matter that when I
digitally sign a message, people who use Outlook for iDevice get a
garbled version?  It's not my problem.  Let someone else investigate.
Instead of looking deeper into issues, I'll just report them [9].
WebAdvisor/Self Service/Academic Planning/Student Planning doesn't
show courses?  Someone else can deal with the issues and implications.

21. Work on a list of departmental issues to discuss with Dean
and/or Chair of Faculty.  **Place on hold**.  I'll wait until they
reach out to me.  I think they said they would.

22. Muse about the wonder of first-year registration.  **Skip**.  I'd
love to write about the process, about my predictions for round one,
my surprises [10] in looking at the schedule, my observations on the
process, and more.  But that's a task for today and tomorrow and,
after everything else, I don't have time [11].  But you know what? I
should still save the data.

23. Muse.  **Leave on hold**.  I love writing.  Maybe I can even avoid
ranting.  But there are higher priorities.

24. Be a busybody.  **Attempt to stop**.  Part of my character is
that I tend to be pushy about sharing information or encouraging
others to share.  I see, for example, that I have a note on my to-do
list that I should follow-up with someone who told me that their
department's scheduling requests were ignored by the Registrar and
offer to share their concerns with our Faculty Chair.  I should
stop doing those kinds of things.  I'm pretty sure I learned this
characteristic from my mother.

25. Follow guidelines, even stupid ones.  **Continue?**  I was 
thinking about this today as I attempted to follow a recent guideline
to notify ITS [12] before I installed software on my College-owned
laptop.  But better safe than sorry.

26. Seek counseling.  **Add**.  Given everything above, it seems
necessary.

Hmmm.  Thirteen (13) or so to place on hold.  Nine (9) or so to
prioritize (or equivalent).  Maybe I should have written "Drop"
rather than "Place on hold" for more things.  I guess that can be
a task for later.  I wish I didn't have to deal with the issues
I've marked as "Darn".  I wonder if I can hold off on any of the
"Prioritize" items.  I'm must admit that I am not sure how nine
plus thirteen ends up being twenty-six.  

And then there are the other categories of things that I've managed
to repress that I will remember over the next few days or that
others will remind me of.  I hope I can put all of those on hold.

You know what makes me sad?  I told myself that I was going to try
to stay away from work today.  I spent two hours on necessary work
things (final messages on software issues, followup emails, things
related to those darn issues [14], etc.) and another ninety minutes
on advising issues for my Tutorial students.  I also spent another
thirty minutes on this musing.  And I'm not counting the time I
spent trying to organize my to-do list.

Next up: Learning to turn off my email.  Today, it will be off
during the day until I check it in the evening [15].  This week, I will
try to keep it off outside of 8am-5pm.  Can I do it?  We shall see.

[1] That document indicates that I may not share any of its content
publicly.  I will not [2].

[2] Will I get in trouble for sharing that note?  I don't think I should.

[3] Calm down, Sam.  It will get resolved.  It may even get resolved
quickly.

[4] President Harris has indicated she will

[5] I wonder how people will react to that comment.

[6] I expect that Middle Son will throw out one of his favorite
quotes from his grandmother: "We don't need to dismantle the
patriarchy, we need to mantle the matriarchy."  These days, she'd
probably acknowledge that we need to go beyond gender binaries.

[7] There may never be an endnote #13, but there can be a list item
13.  You all know my favorite quotation about this issue.

[8] No, not Uncle Fester.

[9] Apologies to my ITS colleagues.

[10] Why are there still slots in Garrison's Intro Shakespeare?  How
upset are the upper-level students who got dropped from it and won't
be able to add it back in going to be?

[11] It doesn't help that reviewing my Tutorial students' schedules,
filling in some gaps, and sending them recommendations for round one
took about ninety minutes.

[12] More precisely, ITS Information Security.  I'm not sure how to
notify them directly, so I used [help.grinnell.edu](https://help.grinnell.edu).

[14] That is, the topics above I marked as "Darn".

[15] More accurately, I planned to have it off during the day.  I
failed.

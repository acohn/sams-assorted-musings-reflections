Encounters with computer scientists and tabletop games, or something like that
==============================================================================

*Topics/tags: [Games](index-games), rambly*

The other day, Eldest, Youngest, and I decided to play _The Great Dalmuti_,
which is one of our family's favorite games [1].  Because it's my children,
they realized that we never had to switch seats; we could just switch the
direction in which we played [2].  Then Michelle [3] joined us.  My kids
then determined that we never had to have more than two people switch seats,
as long as we were comfortable having _The Great Dalmuti_ switch seats.

Anyway, that got me to thinking about when and how I first learned the
game.

Way back in 2009, SIGCSE was in Chattanooga, Tennessee [4].  I'd driven
down with my research assistant and a student.  The primary conference 
hotel, or at least the hotel I was staying at, took advantage of the weather
and had the entrances to the rooms on the outside.  That is, in going to your
room, you'd walk through a courtyard, by a train.  

On the first or second night, I was walking back to my room at about
10 p.m. and encountered Steve Wolfman, the SIGCSE 2009 Program
Chair.  Steve said, "Hey Sam, I got this great new game.  Want to
play?"  I replied, "Steve, it's late.  I'd rather go to bed."  Steve
then said, "But I hear it's a great game.  And look, it says here
that it only takes ten minutes."  Now, you can't really say no to
the Program Chair, can you?  So I said "Yes" and we wandered over
to the hotel bar [6] to read the rules.  We gathered a few other people
along the way.

Two hours later, we finally finished reading the rules [7] to _Space
Alert_.  And Steve was right.  At that point, it only took ten
minutes.  That encounter started years of playing games with Steve
at SIGCSE.  I recall playing _Bunny Bunny Moose Moose_ on the
executive floor one year [8] and learning about _Codenames_ in the
lobby of a hotel in Memphis [9,10].  A few years ago, in Kansas City,
I believe, a colleague introduced us to his game about fire dancing.
I also have fond memories of playing games in the Student Volunteer
room in Atlanta [11].  Two or three years ago, SIGCSE decided to
have an official Tabletop Game area [12].

In any case, the next few nights, the hotel bar became a place for
people to play games.  On the second night, computer science legend
Eric S. Roberts showed up and taught us _The Great Dalmuti_.  I
recall him saying something like "This is a great game that went
out of print for a while, but now it's back in print."  He was right;
it's a great game.  The rules are relatively simple.  The strategy
is more complex.  You can play for five minutes, or for five hours
[14].  Plus, it reveals important societal concepts.  It's been part
of the Rebelsky repertoire ever since, or at least once I found a
copy.

So, how do you play _The Great Dalmuti_?  Perhaps that's a subject
for [a subsequent musing](great-dalmuti-2019-12-20) [15].

[1] Don't worry, if you don't know _The Great Dalmuti_, I'll explain
it later.

[2] That will make sense when you understand the rules.

[3] I'm not sure why I'm comfortable describing my three children as
Eldest, Middle, and Youngest, but I feel like I should write "Michelle"
rather than "Wife".

[4] Did I spell that right?  Let's see .. Tee ee en en ee ess ess eye pea
pea eye, or something like that [5].  

[5] If that didn't make sense, you probably never learned the rhythm
of spelling Mississippi, or you are not a northerner, or something
like that.

[6] Always a good place to play games.

[7] No, that's not an exaggeration.

[8] In the year of the executive floor year, we also played
a time travel game that a Grinnell student was in the process of
designing.  I think he abandoned it, but it had the potential to
be a great game.

[9] I'm pretty sure that Steve buys games from publishers other than
Czech Games Editions.  But those are three highlights.  Speaking of CGE,
my family also likes _Dungeon Lords_ and _Alchemists_.

[10] In playing _Codenames_, I learned that Eric S. Roberts understands
deep game strategy much more quickly than I ever will.

[11] At least I think it was Atlanta.

[12] I had regularly suggested it to the Conference Chairs.  I'm not sure
if I had any impact, but I like to pretend that I did.

[14] That is not an exaggeration.  Eldest, Youngest, and I started playing
at about noon yesterday.  After Michelle and Middle joined us, we finished
at about 5 p.m.

[15] Did I say that I'd cover the rules later in the musing?  I'm pretty
sure that I just wrote "later".  Another musing is "later".  And I'll 
post it with this musing [16].

[16] Why not keep them together?  It felt better to separate the
storytelling from the

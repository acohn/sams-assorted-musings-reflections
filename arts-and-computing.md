Arts and computing at Grinnell, a personal perspective
======================================================

*Themes/topics: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), Grinnell, rambly*

Recently, someone asked me about the status of arts/computing interactions
at Grinnell.  I sketched some basic ideas and sent them along.  But
sketching those ideas made me realize that I really wanted to sit down and
write something a bit more substantial.  While my primary professional
passion is finding ways to broaden participation in computing, finding
intersections between art making and computing is a close second.

Writing about arts and computing at Grinnell is difficult since I find
myself pulled in so many ways.  I want to write about my own projects,
since they are closest to my heart.  But I really value all the cool
and important things my colleagues around campus do [1].  And then there
are the students, who do brilliant things at the intersection of computing
and arts.  So you'll find that my comments are scattershot, at best.

[1] I'd love more opportunities to collaborate with them.  But time for
collaboration is limited.  I hope that I don't have to wait until I reach
Senior Faculty Status.

Certainly, the art-focused iteration of CSC 151 was a big thing; we used that curriculum for a decade or so.  (And we may return to it, at least as an option; data science and digital humanities aren't for everyone.)

I also taught a "Computer Programming as Studio Practice" course for Global Online Academy.  (The official title was "The Code of Art | The Art of Code".  It was really designed as a studio course with code as the medium.)

We see an increasing number of students who are combining Studio Art and Computer Science majors.  Bea Herce-Hagiwara '18 just did a really interesting piece (that even got a showing in a gallery in Chicago) in which she had a computer program generate crochet patterns for her which she then crocheted.

Andrew Kaufman has certainly been doing some cool things with technology and the arts in his courses, including the special topics on collage (or something like that) last spring and his regular digital media course.  Justin Thomas's special topics course on computers in theatre (whose actual name I can't recall) was also pretty awesome.  Andrew, Justin, Jeremy Chen, and I keep talking about finding a way to collaborate on a course, but never seem to have time.

My current research project, which I put on hiatus to run code camps for three summers, involves creating an application that encourages a different way of thinking about art making.  I hope to return to that when I go on sabbatical in Fall 2019.

I've also been in touch with Lesley Wright about a gallery exhibit on "Instructions" (e.g., the wall drawings of Sol LeWitt).  Like too many things, it's been put on the back burner because of our enrollments.

Oh, there's also Matt Kluber's Digital Bridge project which, if I recall correctly, looks at the issues of digitally curating student artworks.

Perhaps most importantly, the new "Media Studies" major (or whatever it is) is likely to build connections between the arts and computing since it's primary focus is on filmmaking; it's difficult to make film these days without at least considering the digital.

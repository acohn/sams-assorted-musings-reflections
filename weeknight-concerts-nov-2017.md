Weeknight concerts
==================

Today I got a postcard from the Jonathan Richman mailing list.
JR does not use computers, so I generally hear about concerts
through the mailing list [1].  He's playing in [Cedar Rapids on November
7](http://legionarts.org/events/jonathan-richman-featuring-tommy-larkins-on-drums).
That's a Tuesday night.  I teach early on Wednesday mornings.

Sitting on my desk next to the invitation is a flyer
for the BoDeans, who are playing in [Des Moines on November
9](http://www.woolysdm.com/event/1557549-bodeans-stripped-down-des-moines/).
That's a Thursday night.  I teach early on Friday mornings, too.

So, here are the questions [2].

1. Am I too old to go to weeknight [3] concerns when they are an hour or more
away from home?

2. If I'm not too old, can I afford (time, sleep, energy) to go to both?

3. If I only go to one, to which one should I go?

4. Michelle is on call both Tuesday and Thursday.  She likes the BoDeans
more than I do.  She always enjoys seeing Jonathan Richman.  Is it fair
to go without her?

5. If it's fair to go without her, with whom would I go?

[1] I keep thinking someone will set up an email list, but it may be
that he doesn't allow it.

[2] These are mostly questions for myself.  But if you feel a desire
to answer, feel free to do so.

[3] Am I the only one who keeps focusing on the "knight" in "weeknight" and
then wondering whether it's misspelled?

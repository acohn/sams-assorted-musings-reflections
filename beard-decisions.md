Bad beard decisions
===================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

There are all sorts of bad decisions.  There are the bad decisions that
are easy to recover from.  For example, if you stay up late binge-watching
a TV show and are exhausted the next day, you can catch up on sleep later
in the week [1].  There are the bad decisions that are difficult or
impossible to recover from.  For example, you might sell or give away 
something that has individual, personal meeting [2].

And then there are the bad decisions that fall somewhere in the middle.
I made one of those the other day.  I was getting sick of how my beard
looked [4].  So I shaved it.  I regret that decision.  I'd gotten
used to it.  And, well, I don't particularly like how I look unshaven.
In contrast, my mother and my honorary sister would probably say "Oh,
it's nice to see more of your smiley face."  Middle son is glad I shaved.
Eldest and Youngest haven't seen it.  Michelle is somewhere in the middle.  
I think she said, "It always takes a while to get used to you without
a beard."

So now I have a bad decision from which I need to recover.  If I were
my middle son, I'd wait a week and I'd have a passable beard.  But I'm
not my middle son.  My facial hair is more sparse, it's white, and it
grows more slowly.  So I'm tempted to leave myself clean-shaven.

Now, it's not like I've had a beard my entire adult life.  I'm not
sure when I grew a beard, but it's less than a decade ago.  When I
look back at pictures around the department, more of my career has been
beardless than bearded.  So I've been bearded for less than 1/5 my life.
And I'll admit that I sometimes enjoy shaving [5].

I also realized that I don't like having [long hair](my-hair) without a 
beard.  So I thought about cutting my hair, too.

Nonetheless, I'm happy with my long hair [6].  And, as I think about it,
I really do prefer myself bearded.  So I'm going to have a month or so
of that time in between clean-shaven and a reasonable beard.  

I do need to figure out what to do once I regrow the beard.  Getting
a regular trim by a professional is probably the right thing to do.
That would be a good beard decision.

[1] That's what I hear.  I never seem to catch up.

[2] For example, a long, long time ago I traded away a signed copy of _Pogo_
that I had gotten from my uncle [3].  I still don't remember why.

[3] While that's not a huge bad decision, it's still a book that I'll never
be able to replace.

[4] It didn't help that they had a picture of me with the beard in the
campus memo.

[5] Yeah, really.

[6] Sorry, Middle!

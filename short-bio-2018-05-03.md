A short biography
=================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short, things I had to write anyway*

Once in a while, I get asked to write about myself.  This time, I think I
accidentally agreed to be on a panel at Alumni College [1] and they felt
like they should have something better than what I put on the College's
Web site [2].  But what goes in a short biography?  For Grinnell, I consider
it important to include my honorary membership in two different classes:
the class of 2001, which is "my" class because I started at the same time
they did [3], and the class of 2017, which included at two graduates who
I've known since childhood.  Broadening participation in computing is a
key aspect of what I do, so it belongs there.  And I suppose I should
say something about my scholarship and professional responsibilities.

I also find myself wondering how I should refer to myself in a biography.
I don't really like to use the name "Sam" in print since it encourages
people to refer then list me as "Sam Rebelsky", which I *really* dislike
[6].   I sometimes try the casual "SamR", but it usually doesn't work
for more than a sentence or two.  "Professor Rebelsky" feels ostentatious 
[7].  "Samuel" is a bit long and it's not how most people refer to me.
So I end up with "Rebelsky" [8].  It's not perfect, but it suffices.

Here's what I sent.

> Samuel A. Rebelsky is professor of computer science at Grinnell College,
where he has been teaching since Fall 1997.  "SamR", as he is known to
his students, is proud to have been designated as an honorary member of
the class of 2001 at their tenth anniversary and of the class of 2017
at their Baccalaureate.  Rebelsky's current scholarship explores the
intersection of arts and computing, particularly non-traditional computing
tools for creating artworks.  Rebelsky also makes diversifying computer
science a key aspect of his mission.  He says, "If computer technology
is changing the world, we have a responsibility to ensure that a wide
variety of people design that technology".  His commitment to diversity
reveals itself in a variety of ways, from running summer "code camps" for
middle-school students to redesigning curriculum to be more inclusive to
initiating a "broadening participation in computing" fund at the College.
Rebelsky also serves as vice chair for the Association of Computing
Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group in Computers and Society, as a
member of the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics, and as list manager
for the ACM Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education.

What was that comment?  "It's not perfect, but it suffices."  Does it?
I don't mention most of my service at Grinnell.  "Rebelsky serves
on the boards of the Wilson Center for Leadership and Innovation,
the Faulconer Gallery, and the Center for Teaching, Learning, and
Assessment [9]."  It doesn't mention the musings.  "Rebelsky writes
daily about his life as a faculty member and Grinnellian."  It doesn't
mention the implications.  "Because of his personality and vocal [11]
commentary, Rebelsky is feared across campus."  Or is that "revered"?
Maybe just "valued".  Perhaps "ignored".  Maybe I started it wrong.
"In spite of ... Rebelsky is tolerated ...".  Best not to comment on
the musings or my reception on campus.

What's that Michelle says?  "Perfect is the enemy of good".  And yes,
that's obvious.  When you strive for perfection, you don't accept good.
But that's not what she means.  She means that if you keep trying to make
something that's good enough perfect, you often end up with something that
isn't even good enough.

Perhaps I'll try the other aphorism.  "Close enough for folk", or at least
for a musing.

[1] I forgot to ask [my advisory board](my-advisory-board) first.

[2] Let's see ... "Samuel A. Rebelsky is a Professor of Computer
Science at Grinnell College.  'SamR', as his students call him, has
been at Grinnell since 1997.  (He therefore considers himself part of
the Grinnell class of 2001.)"

[3] And because the Roses, Like Cake [4], That Famous Comedian, Joey, Sarah
[5], and many others are members of that class.  They shaped my teaching
identity at Grinnell and I appreciate being part of their class.

[4] Now that I finally understand pronunciation, I want to call him
"Live Ache".  But I don't think he'd appreciate that.

[5] Also known as "That student who graduated a year early and became
a Java trainer, effectively doing much of what I did, except with higher
pay and more travel."  And it seems no matter how much my salary goes
up, I have a new graduate who makes more than I do.

[6] My professional name is "Samuel A. Rebelsky".  You show respect by
using it.  You show disrespect by assuming that I'm okay with "Sam Rebelsky".

[7] My children would also insist that I use "Professor Rebelsky 2", since
my mother was "Professor Rebelsky" first.

[8] Yes, I realize that "Rebelsky" and "Samuel" have the same number of
syllables.  

[9] I hate the commas in CTLA [10].   They require that I either have to put it
at the end of a list or separate the items of the list with semicolons.

[10] Yes, I know that they are necessary.  But couldn't we have just
called it the "Center for Teaching and Learning", like most schools do?
That way, it could also be a TLA instead of including the letters "TLA".

[11] No it's not ableist in this context.  Or at least I don't think it is.

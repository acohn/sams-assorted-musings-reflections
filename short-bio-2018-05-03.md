A short biography
=================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short, things I had to write anyway*

Once in a while, I get asked to write about myself.  For example,
this past fall, I had to write [a biography for a poster in the
department](bio-2017-08-29).  This week, I got asked to write a shorter 
biography [1].  Why? I accidentally agreed to be on a panel at Alumni College
[2] and they felt like they should have something better than what I
put on the College's Web site [3].  But what goes in a short biography?
For Grinnell, I consider it important to include my honorary membership
in two different classes: the class of 2001, which is "my" class
because I started at the same time they did [4], and the class of
2017, which included at least two graduates who I've known since
childhood.  Broadening participation in computing is a key aspect of
what I do, so it belongs there.  And I suppose I should say something
about my scholarship and professional responsibilities [8].

I also find myself wondering how I should refer to myself in a biography.
I don't really like to use the name "Sam" in print since it encourages
people to refer then list me as "Sam Rebelsky", which I *really* dislike
[9].   I sometimes try the casual "SamR", but it usually doesn't work
for more than a sentence or two.  "Professor Rebelsky" feels ostentatious 
[10].  "Samuel" is a bit long and it's not how most people refer to me.
So I end up with "Rebelsky" [11].  It's not perfect, but it suffices.

Here's what I sent.

> Samuel A. Rebelsky is professor of computer science at Grinnell College,
where he has been teaching since Fall 1997.  "SamR", as he is known to
his students, is proud to have been designated as an honorary member of
the class of 2001 at their tenth anniversary and of the class of 2017
at their Baccalaureate.  Rebelsky's current scholarship explores the
intersection of arts and computing, particularly non-traditional computing
tools for creating artworks.  Rebelsky also makes diversifying computer
science a key aspect of his mission.  He says, "If computer technology
is changing the world, we have a responsibility to ensure that a wide
variety of people design that technology".  His commitment to diversity
reveals itself in a variety of ways, from running summer "code camps" for
middle-school students to redesigning curriculum to be more inclusive to
initiating a "broadening participation in computing" fund at the College.
Rebelsky also serves as vice chair for the Association of Computing
Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group in Computers and Society, as a
member of the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics, and as list manager
for the ACM Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education.

What was that comment I just made?  "It's not perfect, but it suffices."
Does it?  I don't mention most of my service at Grinnell.  "Rebelsky
serves on the boards of the Wilson Center for Leadership and Innovation,
the Faulconer Gallery, and the Center for Teaching, Learning, and
Assessment [12]."  It doesn't mention the musings.  "Rebelsky writes
daily about his life as a faculty member and Grinnellian."  It doesn't
mention the implications.  "Because of his personality and vocal [15]
commentary, Rebelsky is feared across campus."  Or is that "revered"?
Maybe just "valued".  Perhaps "ignored".  Maybe I started it wrong.
"In spite of ... Rebelsky is tolerated ...".  Best not to comment on
the musings or my reception on campus.

What's that Michelle says?  "Perfect is the enemy of good".  In the 
first reading, that's obvious: When you strive for perfection, you don't
accept good.  But that's not what she means.  She means that if you keep
trying to make something that's good enough perfect, you often end up
with something that isn't even good enough.

Perhaps I'll try another aphorism.  "Close enough for folk", or at least
for a musing [16].

In any case, I've submitted it already, so it will stand.  Maybe I'll
spend more time on the next one.

[1] More accurately, I got asked about two weeks ago.  I wrote it this
week.

[2] I forgot to ask [my advisory board](my-advisory-board) first.

[3] Let's see ... "Samuel A. Rebelsky is a Professor of Computer
Science at Grinnell College.  'SamR', as his students call him, has
been at Grinnell since 1997.  (He therefore considers himself part of
the Grinnell class of 2001.)"  I've written worse.

[4] Also because the Roses, Like Cake [5], some famous comedian, Joey,
that awesome woman from the class of '01 who graduated in three years
[6], that Pixar guy, the documentary filmmaker from Iowa City, and many
others are members of that class.  These students shaped my teaching
identity at Grinnell.  I appreciate being considered part of their class.

[5] Now that I finally understand pronunciation, I want to call him
"Live Ache".  But I don't think he'd appreciate that.

[6] Also known as "That student who not only graduated a year early 
but also became a Java trainer, effectively doing much of what I did,
except with higher pay [7] and more travel."  

[7] She was the first of many graduates whose starting salary was
higher than my current salary.  It seems no matter how much my salary
goes up, I have a new graduate who makes more than I do.

[8] If I'd been really sensible, I would have remembered that I had
written a biography this past fall and looked at it.

[9] My professional name is "Samuel A. Rebelsky".  You show respect by
using it.  You show disrespect by assuming that I'm okay with "Sam Rebelsky".

[10] My children would also insist that I use "Professor Rebelsky 2", since
my mother was "Professor Rebelsky" first.

[11] Yes, I realize that "Rebelsky" and "Samuel" have the same number of
syllables.  

[12] I hate the commas in CTLA [14].   They require that I either have to put it
at the end of a list or separate the items of the list with semicolons.

[14] Yes, I know that they are necessary.  But couldn't we have just
called it the "Center for Teaching and Learning", like most schools do?
That way, it could also be a TLA instead of including the letters "TLA".

[15] No it's not ableist in this context.  Or at least I don't think it is.

[16] Or "close enough for alumni college".

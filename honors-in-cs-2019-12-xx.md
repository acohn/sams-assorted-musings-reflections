Honors in Computer Science
==========================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia), [Grinnell](index-grinnell)*

I'm not sure why, but I've recently been thinking about the
requirements for honors in CS at Grinnell.  In order to be awarded
honors in a department at Grinnell, you need at least a 3.4 overall
gpa, at least a 3.5 gpa in the major [1], and to meet the individual
department's requirements.  You also should not have been found
responsible for a violation of academic honesty.

Early in my career at Grinnell, we had a fairly clear set of
requirements: You had to take both CSC-211, _Computer Organization
and Architecture_, and CSC-213, _Operating Systems and Parallel
Algorithms_; you had to take an extra upper-level CS or math class;
you had to do extra-curricular work on campus judged as excellent
by the members of the department; and you had to do external work
judged as excellent, such as high performance on the GREs or
publishing a paper.

That's a lot of requirements.  Hence, we often awarded honors to
students who had met only three of the four requirements, provided
they had done particularly well at one of the last two requirements.
That is, if you did really good research at Grinnell or elsewhere,
we might waive the need to take both CSC-211 and CSC-213, or might
skip the extra course.  We also tended to allow PHY-220, _Electronics_,
as an alternative to CSC-211.

A few years ago, we changed the requirements to be more like those
of other departments [2].  They now read,

> To be considered for honors in computer science, graduating seniors, in addition to meeting the College's general requirements for honors, must also demonstrate exceptional commitment to the discipline and its values, as evidenced by significant engagement in the department and excellence in computing-related work, both in the classroom and beyond.

Isn't that wonderfully vague?  But there are still three criteria
in the par graph: "significant engagement with the department",
"excellence ... in the classroom", and "excellence ... beyond [the
classroom]".  Engagement is often evidenced by service as a peer
educator or member of one of the department's student groups, along
with attendance at department events, such as CS Table and the
weekly CS extras.  Excellence in the classroom is obvious.  While
grades are a start, we do look beyond grades to see how students engage
with the material [3].  For excellence beyond the classroom, we often
look toward research, either at Grinnell or elsewhere.  We also try to
accommodate internships.  However, because of non-disclosure agreements,
it can be difficult to tell how well a student did in an internship.
At times, we might take an offer to return as evidence.

I was originally in favor of the change from the specific rules to
the more vague paragraph, but I must admit that it's getting harder
and harder to decide whether or not students deserve honors,
particularly as we deal with larger and larger numbers of students
in the department and, therefore, larger numbers of candidates for
honors.  

In any case, as I think about our core requirements ("significant
engagement in the department and excellence in computing-related
work"), I begin to wonder why Grinnell requires a high gpa  for
honors.  Isn't it honorable if you do excel in those two things,
even if your gpa is lower?  And don't students sometimes achieve
higher gpas by taking fewer risks?  I recall one peer in high school
who refused to take AP Calculus because they knew they'd get an A
in the non-AP math course and worried they might get a B in the AP
course.  I'd rather a student who takes courses in which they might
get lower grades because they want to challenge themselves.  Why
do we, as an institution, focus so much on gpa?

Beyond GPA, I'd like to see a return to more explicit criteria,
along with an explicit description of whether or not you need to
meet all of the criteria.  I identified three things we'd like to
see.  We could separate those out and describe how students achieve
those criteria.  I'd like to see us put back the extra courses;
it's hard to believe that a student who has taken a minimal major
has really shown "exceptional commitment to the discipline".  We
should tell them that.

Given that I usually prefer holistic assessment, I'm a bit surprised to 
find that I am inclined to use a rubric or checklist for assigning
honors.  However, holistic assessment requires deeper knowledge and
deeper evidence than we normally have of a student.  For example,
is a student who seems less engaged perhaps introverted, or do they
have other obstacles, such as workload?  And it seems fairer to students
to have explicit criteria.

I wonder what other departments do.

On a separate note, there's a question of when we should notify
students.  Traditionally, most students only found out that they
had received honors when they arrived at graduation and saw honors
listed after their name in the program.  Over time, some departments
started to send congratulatory notes.  Then the Registrar's office
took over sending congratulatory notes so that they all went out
at once [4].

There are some advantages to late notification, at least from a
departmental perspective.  Perhaps most importantly, you don't have 
students challenging the decision not to award honors [5].

But there are also some significant disadvantages.  Among other
things, it means that students can't put their honors on their
résumés and CVs.  That can affect their applications for jobs and
graduate school, particularly if other institutions award and
announce honors earlier.  With the many changes to hiring, such as
many companies hiring in fall, rather than spring, should we change
when we announce honors?

Perhaps that's a question for Careers, Life, and Service [6].

[1] I don't know whether they count required courses from outside
the department in that computation.  For example, do we count MAT-218
or the "other course in Mathematics and Statistics creditable toward
the Mathematics major" in the computation?

[2] Or at least that's what someone said.

[3] We use "engage" a lot.  Do we expect students to marry our discipline?

[4] At least that's what I thought.  Eldest tells me that he recalls 
hearing about each of his three honors at separate times, but is not
positive.

[5] "Why did X receive honors and I did not?"

[6] While they should not make the decision, they do have the
expertise to provide the faculty with some context as we consider
options.  I do think the decision should be institutional rather
than departmental.

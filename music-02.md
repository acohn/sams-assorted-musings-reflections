What do you listen to? part two
===============================

_Earlier this summer, my students asked what music I listen to.  Since
they were not satisfied with "almost everything", I agreed to write about
my musical preferences.  In [part one](music-01), I wrote about the
development of my popular musical tastes.  In this part, I write about
some of the music that Michelle and I listened to in the early years of
marriage, from marriage through right before moving to Grinnell._

When Michelle and I got married, I added a wonderful person to my life
and she added, um, a pack rat.  Even at that time, I had too many books,
too many albums, too much ephemera, and more.  We also got to attempt
to share and develop our musical tastes.  There are some things that
I listened to [1] that she did not like.  When we saw X, she found
it too loud, but she was amused by Exene Cervenka and John Doe fight
on stage.  She said Phillip Glass sounded like "tinkle tinkle tinkle"
[2].  I can't remember whether or not she attended Hüsker Dü with me
[3], but, if she did, she didn't like it.  In contrast, I found some of
her music a bit, shall we say, treacly.  If I never hear "Cats in the
Cradle" again, my life will be better [4].

But we also found a reasonably large amount of music that we enjoyed in
tandem and listened to together in the car (traveling between Hyde Park
and Oak Park, or between Chicagoland to Boston, or between Hanover and
Waterville, or wherever).  We didn't see a lot of concerts together, but
we saw some, and I think they helped influence her taste.  We saw both
the Blasters and Joe Ely [5] at Fitzgerald's.  If I recall correctly,
one of the highlights of the Joe Ely concert was Ely and one of his band
vying for who got to sing what verse of "West Texas Waltz".  We were
already listening to Michelle Shocked by the _Captain Swing_ tour, but
seeing her solidified our enjoyment of her music.

But a lot of our taste formed from tapes and CDs I bought and taped
for travelling [6].  These days, when we play songs from some of 
these albums, Eldest and Middle note that they are vaguely familiar,
but they can't remember why.  Others, we continued playing with them.

_Romeo's Escape_ by Dave Alvin.  We already loved the Blasters (see
below).  So I picked up Dave Alvin's solo album when it came out.
While brother Phil's voice is an incredible instrument, Dave Alvin's
take on his own songs, particular "Fourth of July" (which he'd
done with X) and "Border Radio", which is wonderfully world weary.

_Bad is Beautiful_ by the Bad Examples.  I picked this up from the
$2 bin from some used record store in Harvard Square.  It quickly
became a favorite.  Thoughtful and varied power pop.  We continued
listening to this even after the kids were born, even though the
lyrics are rarely appropriate for children.  When I took the kids
to the Bad Examples' 25th anniversary show, folks assumed they were
there because of Ralph Covert's kids music, but they loved his real
rock.

_Cheap Beer Night_ by the Bad Examples.  A great live album by
the group.  Contains "Hey St. Peter", which may be the kids'
favorite (and least appropriate) song.  The chorus goes "Hey
St. Peter, won't you open up your gate?  I hear the devil calling.
Now please don't make me late.  He's got loud guitars, alcohol,
cheap Jamaican whores.  I don't want to stay in Heaven no more."
We're great parents, aren't we?

_Gordon_ by Barenaked Ladies.  Joyful and silly music.  I'd 
say "If I had $1,000,000" and "Brian Wilson" were favorites, but
we loved the whole album.  When we did a vacation in Toronto,
I made sure to track down their legendary "Yellow Tape", which
we listened to repeatedly on the way home.

_The Blasters_ by The Blasters.  Roots rock, before roots rock was big.
Dave Alvin is an amazing songwriter.  Phil Alvin is a great singer.
The core band is strong, and when they include Gene Taylor and Steve
Berlin, they are transcendent.  "American Music" remains one of the great
tributes to the wide variety of music.  "Marie, Marie" recalls fifties
"girl name" rockabilly, and "Border Radio" is one or the great songs
about the experience of American (or Mexican) radio.

_Non Fiction_ by The Blasters.  Not quite as great, but still contains
a wonderful range of songs.  "Jubilee Train" and "Long White Cadillac"
are probably my favorites, but "Bus Station" continues to reveal
Dave Alvin's skills as a storyteller.

_Hard Line_ by The Blasters.  "Common Man" remains one of the great
political songs of our time.  I hadn't realized it at the time, but
"Rock & Roll Will Stand" makes a great bookend to "American Music".

_My I'm Large_ by the Bobs.  Fun and funny a cappella.

_Peter Case_ by Peter Case.  I love Case from his work with _The
Plimsouls_  - "A Million Miles Away" is a classic of power pop,
but there are so many other Plimsouls songs I love, too.  In any
case, like many musicians of the time, Case broke away from his
band to make more folky music.  I'm not sure that there are 
particular songs that stand out from his solo debut, but it's
an album that lived in the car with us.

_Marshall Crenshaw_ by Marshall Crenshaw.  Great pop by a Beatles
devotee.  If I recall correctly, we also had a tape recorded live 
from the radio, and liked many songs from there, too.  We saw him
live a few years ago, and it wasn't the same.

_Honky Tonk Masquerade_ by Joe Ely.  His breakout album.  Not quite
country, not quite rock, certainly not Eagles-style country-rock.
An amazing variety of songs that bring together what makes country
great (lyrics that reflect the likely experience of everyman) with
some of the best songs by Butch Hancock, particularly "West Texas
Waltz" and "Boxcars".  But "Fingernails", by Ely, is an awesome
rocker, with some of the absurdities that you'd expect from, say,
Little Richard or Jerry Lee Lewis (e.g., "I keep my fingernails long
so they click when I play the piano.").

_Lord of the Highway_ by Joe Ely.  Harder songs, but the same
great variety.  "Me and Billy the Kid" is a great revenge song.
"Row of Dominoes" is probably my second favorite song on the album,
and has one of the great opening lines I've heard: "Carmen must
have been the devil's daughter.  At least he taught her how
to wear her clothes."

_Love is a Strange Hotel_ by Clive Gregson and Christine Collister.
Another $2 bin favorite, which I picked up because I'm a sucker for
cover albums.  Amazing versions of songs both famous ("The Things
We Do For Love" by 10cc, "For a Dancer" by Jackson Browne) and less so
(the title tune, by Boo Hewerdine and Darden Smith [7].

_Walking on a Wire_ by Lowen and Navarro.  Yet another $2 bin find.
Lowen and Navarro were songwriters - their "We Belong" was a great
hit for Pat Benetar.  This album shows their strengths singing their
own songs.  Michelle and I have taken the kids to see Dan Navarro
a few times.  He's been thoughtful and gracious when the kids tell
him how much they love his songs (and he seems to remember us from
show to show).

_Poi Dog Pondering_ by Poi Dog Pondering.  We let a random Internet
acquaintance couch surf at our house and he convince dus to go see
them.  Their concert was joyful and fun, and their music is the same.
A wide variety of instrumentation contributes to the overall sound.

_Jonathan Sings_ by Jonathan Richman.  I've listed this one already,
but it's certainly a shared favorite.  "Not Yet Three" is a song that
will always be special to us, and it's something we sang to all of
our kids.  But "That Summer Feeling", "Those Conga Drums", "This
Kind of Music", and "Stop This Car" bring such thoughtfulness
and joy that I couldn't do without them.  And I love Ellie Marshall
on "The Neighbors".

_Texas Campfire Tapes_ by Michelle Shocked.  Released without her
permission, and at the wrong speed, this is still an awesome set
of songs by an amazing songwriter with just her guitar.

The Mercury Trilogy: _Short Sharp Shocked_, _Captain Swing_, and _Arkansas
Traveller_ by Michelle Shocked.  I think of Michelle Shocked as a folkie,
but on this trilogy she explored a variety of American musical genres.
I think "Anchorage" was Michelle (Rebelsky)'s favorite from _Short
Sharp Shocked_ but we also sang along to "Memories of East Texas".
I love her version of Jean Ritchie's "The L&N Don't Stop Here Anymore".
We listened to the other two albums less, but "(Don't You Mess Around
With) My Little Sister" is a great response to Elvis and "Strawberry Jam"
is a wonderful exploration of the joy of making music.

_This is Now_ by Jon Svetkey.  Jon Strymish, my best friend (other than
Michelle) took my mother to see Svetkey.  Mom bought his tape and
sent it to us.  "Dead and Streets" and "A Way of Praying" are my
favorites, but we love the whole album.  Michelle and I have managed to
see Svetkey's band, The Loomers, a few times.  I think we own all of
their albums and all of Svetkey's solo albums.

And then there were the individual songs that ended up on mix tapes
or that seemed to come up again and again when we spun the dial on 
the radio.  Here's a selection.

* "Lake Shore Drive" by Aliotta Haynes Jerimiah.
* "Don't Pay the Ferryman" by Chris De Burgh (the version from the 
  _Live for Ireland_ anthology)
* "Independence Day" by Martina McBride
* "Jackie Wilson Said (I'm in Heaven When You Smile)" by Van Morrison
* "Barrett's Privateers" by Stan Rogers
* "Rock and Roll Lullaby" by B. J. Thomas

Am I done with these musical musings?  Nope.  I have at least one more
to write about the things I listen to, but that Michelle does not.

---

[1] And still listen to.

[2] She's not wrong.

[3] That concert is preserved on some bonus CD somewhere.

[4] It's not that I hate all Harry Chapin songs; just the ones that are
overplayed.  I could certainly listen to "The Parade's Still Passing By",
his tribute to Phil Ochs, many times.

[5] Separate concerns.

[6] I did, of course, tape traditional favorites like the Beatles and
Bruce Springsteen.  But this musing focuses more on the new things we
(mostly) discovered together.

[7] I'll write about Darden Smith in another musing.

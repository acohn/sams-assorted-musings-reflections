Grinnell gossip: The (potential) new residence hall
===================================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), short*

During Jim Swartz's talk today about Grinnell architecture in the  _Get to
Know Grinnell_ lecture series, Jim mentioned that one of the early decisions
in the HSSC process was that we would focus on functionality, rather than
bringing in a big-name architect [1,2].  I remember Kate Walker saying
something similar.

After the meeting, I turned to a friend and said something like,
"Given Jim's comment about the HSSC, I'm surprised that we're bringing
in a big-name architect for the new dorms downtown."  They replied,
"What dorms downtown?"  I explained that there's a plan to build a
dorm downtown in the space created by one or more of the buildings
we've bought and torn down downtown.  I'm not sure if it's next to
the new McNally's, or where the old McNally's was, or what.  I'd
heard that the downstairs will be shops and restaurants and upstairs
will be student apartments.

In any case, my friend had not heard.  I asked someone else, and they
said that although they knew, they thought that it wasn't broadly known
on campus.  So I thought I'd do a service by recording what I know about
the plans.  I'm not sure if it's news or what, so I'm just calling it
Grinnell gossip.

What are the plans?  As I noted above, we're planning to build something
downtown that will have shops [3], restaurants [4], and rooms/apartments
for students.

Why are we doing this?  I don't know all of the reasons, but I feel like
I've heard a few.  Let's see.  Some students would likely prefer to live
more in the community than on campus and in apartment-style housing.  This
new dorm would provide that.  There are concerns about the quantity and
quality of off-campus housing available in town [5].  And, if I recall
correctly, we're planning some fairly major renovations to the older
dorms, which means that we need "swing space" [6].

Is it a secret?  I don't think so.  The summary of the October Board
of Trustees meeting says, "The Board discussed the College’s residence
halls and the idea of a new residence hall building located on
campus or in the Zone of Confluence downtown".  So, maybe plans are
less firm than I had though.  I see that the excerpts from the
October 9 minutes of Executive Council say that President Kington
"noted that the Board had a useful discussion with the proposed
architects for the downtown residence hall."  I also note the longer
introduction to the discussion from the excerpts of the October 2
meeting.

> The President commented on the upcoming Board meeting. One of the
topics that will be discussed with the Board is the proposed downtown
residence hall. Council members discussed whether the idea of
building the residence hall should be revisited in light of the
NACAC decision. The President noted that there was still a strong
case for need for the new residence hall (for example, to allow the
College to address accessibility issues and other maintenance needs
for its eleven oldest residence halls) and commented more broadly
upon the College’s plans to navigate the NACAC changes.

I see that the excerpts from October 30 also have the following.

> The President noted that the Board is discussing the programmatic
value of building a downtown residence hall. They are also discussing
how this project would be financed (and whether the College would
simultaneously fund updates to its existing residence halls). These
discussions will culminate in a special Board meeting later this
year.

I wonder if that's the same special Board meeting that will include
discussions of the Student Union.

I was going to say that I didn't remember the name of the proposed
architect.  But I see that it's in the minutes of the August 28, 2019
meeting.

> Adjaye Associates, an architectural firm led by Sir David Adjaye,
has been contacted about the possibility of designing the building.
Adjaye is the lead architect of the Smithsonian National Museum of
African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. The firm
is interested in exploring the project and has visited Grinnell.
Kington is cautiously optimistic that terms can be met for this
potentially transformative project.

I don't know where we stand on Adjaye associates, but it sounds like
a cool opportunity.  However, I do want to hear from Fredo what he
thinks about their work.

I should also note that those minutes include a longer
discussion of the potential new dorm.

Now you know at least as much as I do about the new dorm.

For those who care, the minutes of Faculty Meetings can be found
at
<https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Faculty_Meetings/Forms/Mtg_Materials.aspx>.  Access is limited to people with accounts on GrinCo.  I don't
know if access is more limited than that.  You can also find excerpts
from Council Minutes in the agendas for faculty meetings.  The ones
I mentioned were in the agenda for the November 18 meeting.

Postscript: If you don't know about the NACAC changes and what a Grinnell
Gossip musing on the topic, let me know.

[1] That's not quite how Jim phrased it, but it's close enough.

[2] Insert obligatory comments about music buildings with bumpy floors
that de-tune pianos when you move them, museum buildings with contracts
that disallow display cases, and art buildings that lack loading docks.

[3] Maybe including the bookstore.

[4] As long as we're sure they won't interfere with those already in
town, or so I've heard.

[5] The new regulations on rental housing will likely improve the
quality but decrease the quantity and increase the cost of housing
in town.

[6] No, not for dancing.  However, it would be cool if the new dorms
had a dance floor.

Why some email messages need context
====================================

At about 11:00 p.m. last night, I posted [my latest musing in the
nibbled to death by ducks series](ndd-02).  At about 12:30 a.m., I received
a message from Facebook with the title "[Bulk Mail] *Reader Name* commented
on the link you shared."  What was the comment?

> Sounds wonderful.

My first reaction?  "You think my workload sounds wonderful?  Really?
And I thought I was snarky!"

But it seemed unlikely that this reader would make such a snarky 
comment and so I clicked the "Show on Facebook" button.  It turns
out that they were behind in reading and were actually commenting on 
[my code camp article](code-camp-article-2017-07-24).

I still like the original interpretation, though.

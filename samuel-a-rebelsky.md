Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Samuel A. Rebelsky
================================================================

*Part of an ongoing series about the creatures that inhabit or
have inhabited the land in the middle of nowhere known as
Grinnell College.*

*We are nearing the end of a month in which I've written an essay
about a Grinnellian every day [1].  And, while the essays are
ostensibly about other people, I realize that a lot of them are
implicitly about me, either because I insert myself directly in
the essays or because the essays speak to what I value.  Anyway,
since we're nearing the end of the month, I thought I should make
myself an explicit subject of an essay, rather than an implicit
subject [2,3].*

Colleges have a reputation of gathering people that it seems best
to refer to as "characters", folks who would not necessarily fit
in mainstream society and who have enough distinguishing and quirky
characteristiccs that they are memorable.  One of Grinnell's
characters is Professor and Chair of Computer Science Samuel A.
Rebelsky, who prefers people to refer to him as "Sam".

What can I tell you about Sam?  Let's start with what Sam says about
himself on his front door [5,6]

> I'm a Grinnell student planning to declare a computer science
major. Will you be my academic advisor?

>> I am among the least organized people you will ever meet. You
need only look into my office to figure that out. History suggests
that I will lose your advisee folder as soon as I receive it, and
I probably won't find it again until two years after you graduate.
I am likely to forget anything we discuss, including your courses
and that you are my advisee, unless my remembering inconveniences
you. On the other hand, I am happy to discuss with you course
selections and planning for life beyond Grinnell. I am happy to
help you work through administrative issues at Grinnell (and,
surprisingly, I'm good at navigating adminstrative stuff). I am
also likely to care about you as a person. But I will discuss courses
and life with you, help you with administrivia, and care about you
whether or not you are my advisee. If you're willing to put up with
the negatives, I am happy to serve as your advisor (or adviser, as
the Grinnell Style guide suggests). Note also that I expect you to
take the short essay seriously and show evidence that you've thought
carefully about the purpose of a liberal arts education. You should
make sure to read the sections of the [College
Catalog](http://catalog.grinnell.edu) that discuss a liberal arts
education. You should also read William Cronon's [Only
Connect](http://www.williamcronon.net/writing/cronon_only_connect.pdf).

Which part of that should I address first?  His organization (or lack
thereof) and issues pertaining to that?  His deep concern for our
students?  Or his knowledge of the College and his willingness to use
that knowledge to advocate for students? [7]  Or should I skip all
of that and go on to something else?

Let's start with Sam's "organization".  His office and lab are both
best described by the term "pit".  Hoarder.  Serious horder.  Lets
things pile up.  Jokes about it "Art project!"

Students.

Beyond those issues, one thing that I particularly appreciate is
Sam's willingness to take risks.  You may have heard that he wears
a [Tigger suit](tigger-suit.html) to class on Halloween and April
fool's day.  I'm pretty sure that he does it primarily to brighten
the lives of the people around him.  When Sam teaches Tutorial, he
often holds it in Saints Rest so that his students can have the
mythical college experience of discussing literature and learning
in a coffee shop [n].  Sam gives a [Friday PSA](friday-psa.html)
to his students, asking them to think about the implications of what
they plan to do for the weekend.  Sam is willing to take on the
president and other administrators at faculty meetings, although I
wish that he'd do so in a less confrontational way.  Sam is willing
to make transparent things that many people would keep private,
such as [his department's procedures for assessing candidates in
its tenure-track searches](assessing-candidates.html).  I even hear
that he's started a 'blog of some sort in which he openly criticizes
a wide variety of things on campus.

As you know, the folks we tend to designate as "characters" also
have some not-as-positive quirks.  We've already considered Sam's
forgetfulness [n] and the ways in which his disorganization affects
his ability to get things done.  Those are characteristics we often
associate with older male faculty.  You've probably heard about his
"[dad jokes](dad-jokes.html)".  But one particular negative about
Sam is that he is, let us say, "casual" about getting things graded.
This habit is not new.  When [Rachel Heck Rose](rachel-rose.html)
visited Learning from Alumni, one of the things she pointed out was
that Sam essentially graded no homework in her second course in CS
[n].  Sam says "You learn more from doing than from grades", but I
expect that he also knows that students do deserve feedback.

I will admit that, these days, I'm somewhat worried about Sam.  He's
always seemed a bit stressed, but the stress seems to be particularly
bad last year and this.  It looks like the stress has affected his
health; he's clearly gained a lot of weight in this past year, and
I know that he was proud of how much he'd lost a few years back. I've
heard rumors that he took the Maslach burnout inventory and that his
scores are not good.

However, it looks like he's turning things around a bit. I think
his daily essays have helped give him a more positive outlook; I've
heard he's restarted his exercise program; and he's looking a little
thinner (although I don't know whether or not he really is).  I
have high hopes that his stress will continue to decrease, particularly
now that the CS reunion is done, his online class is ending, and
his chair's responsibilities will get passed on to another faculty
member before fall 2017.

In the end, I feel fortunate that we have someone like Sam at Grinnell.
As importantly, I think Sam feels fortunate to be at Grinnell.  Certainly,
his essays suggest that.

[1] That's not quite accurate.  Since I need to get many of the 
essays approved by their subjects, I sometimes have to write an extra
essay, and I sometimes can skip a day because of that.  But it's close
enough.

[2] My muse is also refusing to let me get any other work done until
I write some parts of this essay.

[3] I should observe that one of my readers noticed that I'd included
myself on the list of Grinnellians I planned to write about and
volunteered to write that essay.  While I appreciate the offer, I think
that person missed the point.  The essays are therapy for me, and they
are supposed to reflect my perspectives, not other peoples' perspectives
[4].

[4] However, I should admit that they *can* reflect other people's
perspectives when I decide to borrow those perspectives.  In those
cases, I do try to cite.

[6] What's a "front door"?  Fortunately, Sam answers that question on
his Front Door [5], too.

> Why do you have links to a Front Door and Origin rather than a Home Page?

>> I'm following the lead of my colleague, John David Stone. Dr.
Stone notes that Home Page is ambiguous, because it can either mean
entry to my site, or place which I use to start my browsing. He
suggests using Front Door for the former and Origin for the latter.

[7] Is there a difference between the latter two?  Perhaps not.

[n] I appreciate that Sam usually treats his students to the coffee
(or other beverages) and muffins (or other foodstuffs) because, in
his words, "Your ability to pay should not affect your ability to
enjoy my class, and I should not need to know about your ability
to pay."

[n] Or at least I think we have.

[n] That class was legendary [n].  They had weekly group homework.  They
had to write an essay about group process to accompany each homework
assignment.  My intent was good, but I never got the homework graded.
(I did, however, grade the insanely hard exams relatively promptly.)
At the end of the semester, I told the students to grade themselves.
No one gave themselves anything higher than a B.  I also got perfect
ratings in the course.  That experience taught me that grading is
optional :-).

[n] It was also legendary in that it contained many of my favorite alums.
Not just Rachel, but also Vivek, Kumail, Joey, Andrew, Sarah, and many,
many more.  They are part of the reason I think of myself as "Grinnell
class of '01", even though I'm not.

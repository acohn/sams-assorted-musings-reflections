"A number of"
=============

*Topic/tag: [Language](index-language), short*

When I write, I regularly find myself using the idiom "a number
of".  The idiom appears in my musings, or at least my draft musings.
For example, I might write, "there are a number of reasons that I muse".
The idiom appears in my scholarly papers.  For example, I might write,
"a number of students raised concerns about pair programming".

But it's not an idiom I should use [1].

"A number of" does not provide a very clear count.   One is a number.
Fifty-two billion, ninety-eight thousand, six hundred and three is also 
a number.  So is negative five.  And pi.  "A number of" provides really
little information about which I mean.

At times, I even add an adjective, as in "a surprising number of
Democratic candidates add me to their email lists" [2].  Does that make
it any better?  No; it's equally bad.  Zero might be surprising, given
my political views.  Ten billion would also be surprising because there
aren't that many Democratic candidates.

I should probably use "some" or "a few" or "many" or "about a dozen",,
depending on the situation.  I try to catch myself; I don't always manage
to do so.  When I don't, I should try harder.  That way, I can reduce
the number of situations in which I use "number of" [3].

Postscript: I suppose I could see what
others mean when they use the idiom.  [At one
place](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/a%20number%20of),
Merriam Webster tells me that it means "more than two but fewer than
many : several".  But [in
another](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/number), I discovered
that one of the definitions of "number" is as follows:

> (3) an indefinite usually large total.  A *number* of members were absent.
The *number* of elderly is rising.

"Unusually large" strikes me as more than many.  And what does it mean if
I write "An unusually large number of members were absent"?  Is that doubly
unusually large?  Or is it just redundant?

Postscript: What unit of speech is "a
number of"?  I turned once again to [Merriam
Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/a%20number%20of),
but all it told me was that it's an idiom.

Of course, the examples suggest that I shouldn't trust Merriam Webster.
In one example, they treat "number of" as an adjective; if "a number of
members *were* absent", "members" is clearly the subject.  However, if
"a number of elderly *is* rising", "number" seems to be the subject.
In the former case, "a number of" seems to be serving as an adjective
for "members".  In the latter case, "of elderly" appears to be modifying
"number".

That makes it even harder to figure out what part of speech we're dealing
with.

Let's consider the case in which "a number of" serves as an adjective.
It seems strange to just call it an "adjective" since I tend to think of
an adjective as a single word.  Would "adjectival phrase" be correct?  I'd
think so, but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective_phrase)
says that "an [adjectival phrase] is a phrase whose head word is an
adjective".  Is "number" an adjective?  I traditionally consider "number"
a noun.  I guess it could be an adjective, as in "the number five".
But it's clearly serving as a noun in "number of".  And Merriam Webster
says it's just a noun, even in the cases in which it seems to be using
"a number of" as an adjective.

I shouldn't trust the InterWeb.  Maybe I'll ask one of our friendly
linguists.

[1] Editing question: I originally wrote: "But it's an idiom I should
not use."  I changed it to "But it's not an idiom I should use."  Which
is better?  And why?

[2] I wrote that sentence while musing about how hard it is to reach
[inbox zero](inbox-zero-revisited-02).  I'm pretty sure I ended up
eliding it.

[3] And yes, the two uses in that sentence are okay.  At the beginning
of the sentence, it doesn't matter how many there are; the focus is
on reduction.  At the end of the sentence, I'm using the idiom itself
as the object of "use", which makes the particular number irrelevant.

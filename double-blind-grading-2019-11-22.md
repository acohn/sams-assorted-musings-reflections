Double-blind grading
====================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia), short*

Today I read with interest [an article in _Inside Higher
Ed_](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/11/22/indiana-university-condemns-professors-racist-and-misogynistic-tweets-strongest)
about how IU is dealing with a tenured faculty member who sends
Tweets that are critical of women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ people.
In [her statement](https://provost.indiana.edu/statements/index.html), 
the IU Provost indicates that although she does not support what the
faculty member says, she supports his first amendment rights to express
his opinions.  To support students who would be reluctant to take his
courses, she suggests that IU will not only offer alternate courses,
but also require that the professor use "double-blind" grading.

I don't have significant comments on the Provost's statement, other
than to note that it seems to do a good job of addressing the issues
at play and that difficult conflicts they raise [1].   But the statement
did get me wondering, _What is double-blind grading?_

I know what *blind grading* is.  In blind grading, you grade student work
without knowing who the student is.  I've used blind grading for most of
my exams for the past few years.  

I know what a *double-blind experiment* is.  In a double-blind
experiment, neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is
in each treatment (or non-treatment) group.  Someone obviously
knows since someone has assigned people to groups.  But those
making direct assessments of effects are supposed to be blind
to the treatment, as are the people receiving the treatment.

I know what *double-blind reviewing* is.  In double-blind reviewing,
neither the authors nor the reviewers know each others' identities.
Ideally, the reviewers don't know each others' identities, either.
When I've meta-reviewed for SIGCSE conferences, I've also been
blind to my reviewers' identities.

But *double-blind grading*?  That's not something I understand.  If
we assume that the professor under consideration is doing his [2]
own grading, his identity is not blind to the students.  The only
model of double-blind grading I know about is that involving graders
[3], in which the students' identities are not revealed to the
graders and the graders' identities are not revealed to the students.
That system clearly helps address bias as it ensures that graders
will not express bias based on student identities and that students
will not challenge grades based on grader identities.  But I'm not
sure why it is particularly appropriate for this situation.  And I
don't think that's what they mean, since the goal seems to be to
"ensure that the grades are not subject to [the Professorâ€™s]
prejudices."

Do *you* know what IU [4] means by "blind grading"?  If so, I'd appreciate
it if you'd share the explanation with me [5].

---

[1] I guess I would have preferred that she added "academic freedom"
to "first amendment rights", but that's probably not essential.

[2] From what I can tell, that professor identifies as male.

[3] Or teaching assistants who grade, if that's the institutional
model.

[4] Or the IU dean.

[5] At that point, I'll add the explanation as a postscript.

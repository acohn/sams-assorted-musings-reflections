<p>
XXX,
</p>

<p>
  I understand that the Personnel Committee has recommended that the
  Trustees of Grinnell College promote you to the rank of Associate
  Professor and award you tenure, that the Dean and the President have
  accepted this recommendation, and that the Trustees have followed
  these recommendations.  Congratulations!  Grinnell is improved by
  your presence, and I am very happy to hear that you will continue
  to be here to the benefit of your students, your colleagues, and the
  broader College community.
</p>

<p>
  Please accept the accompanying gift as part of your entry into
  tenured status.  As you know, Associate Professors naturally take
  on more committee responsiblities.  The gift is intended to provide
  support for you in such activities (or at least to ease the burden of
  such activities).
</p>

<p>
  Because most Grinnell faculty who receive tenure clearly deserve tenure
  and because tenure naturally confers additional work expectations,
  those who receive tenure sometimes feel somehow empty, as if a big event
  lacks the import it should.  (It used to be worse &mdash; at least you
  get an extra raise, which provides some acknowledgement of your value.)
  However, You will discover some additional benefits.  In my own case,
  the first real evidence I saw of the power of tenure was when I got to
  react to what I deemed to be a silly rule (about the particular shade
  of red one must use in presenting the Grinnell logo).  I said, <b>I
  don't care.  I have tenure.</b>  I then went on to do what I wanted.
  In any case, I have found it an empowering and useful phrase, and I
  encourage you to remember it and use it wisely.
</p>

<p>
  Welcome to the ranks of the tenured.  I look forward to working with
  you for years to come.  Congratulations again!
</p>

<p>
  <i>p.s. Associate Dean Karla Erickson has created some support infrastructure 
  for "mid-career" faculty.  I think you now fit in that category.  I'd
  encourage you to use Karla's support.  I've certainly found it helpful.</i>

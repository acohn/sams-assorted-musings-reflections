The Straight Dope
=================

*Topics/tags: [Reviews](index-reviews), short*

Back in my college days, one of my favorite things to read was,
naturally enough, the weekly _Chicago Reader_.  The _Reader_ had
great long-form reporting [1], awesome comic strips [2], and, of
course, the subject of this musing, Cecil Adams' "[The Straight
Dope](https://www.straightdope.com/)".

For those who don't know, "The Straight Dope" was a kind of question
and answer column.  Adams would choose from the questions his readers
had submitted on everything from human evolution [3] to geography [4]
to language [5] and much, much, more.  Adams (and, later, his team of
assistants) would do an in-depth study of the matter, often interviewing
experts in the area and, it seems, reading related technical articles.

Many things made the column a joy to read.  The questions are, well,
different.  Some you've probably asked or thought about.  Others seem to
come out of left field [6].  Adams has a humorous, slightly snarky tone.
Every column is accompanied by a strange illustration by Slug Signorino.
And, well, the answers are relatively thorough.

I stopped reading "The Straight Dope" when I left Chicago.  A few years
ago, I realized that I could subscribe to an email newsletter.  And I've
been reading it weekly ever since.

Then came [today's message](https://www.straightdope.com/a-note-from-cecil-adams-about-the-straight-dope/).

> This week’s Straight Dope marks the last appearance of the column
as the Teeming Millions have known it for the past 45 years.

Why?  It appears that Adams doesn't really own the column.  Sun-Times Media
owns _The Chicago Reader_ and therefore the column.  Interestingly, it
appears that although they are selling _The Reader_, they are keeping the
column.  However, 

> [T]he folks at Sun-Times Media, which will continue to own the Straight
Dope, are re-thinking the once-a-week deep dive (sorta) on a single topic
(usually) in question-and-answer format. [...] But no decision has been
made, and my role, if any, has not been determined.

I'm amazed that Adams has written the column for forty-five years.   Of
course, we don't really know that it's the same person; it's pretty clear
that "Cecil Adams" is not really the author's real name.  But it feels like
the same person.  I'm even more amazed that _The Sun-Times_ would consider
continuing the column without him.  Of course, "Dear Abby" is no longer
written by Pauline Phillips.  Nonetheless, it strikes me as poor practice
in this case.

Is there a positive in all this?  I see one.  Cecil writes

> I’m thinking about publishing another Straight Dope book – it’s
been nigh on 20 years since the last one.

I realize that I'm old fashioned, but I relish the idea of another
physical Straight Dope book.

Fingers crossed!

[1] One of my favorite stories was a profile of "Daddy G" of Gary U.S. 
Bonds' "Quarter to Three".  I'd love to read it again, but I've never
been able to track it down.

[2] Jay Lynch's "Phoebe and the Pigeon People" was definitely a
favorite.

[3] E.g., "[Has human evolution stopped?](https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/3313/has-human-evolution-stopped/)"

[4] E.g., "[Why is Greenland considered an island but not Eurasia?](https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1500/why-is-greenland-considered-an-island-but-not-eurasia/)"

[5] E.g., "[What’s the origin of the expression 'Indian giver'?](https://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/853/whats-the-origin-of-the-expression-indian-giver/)

[6] I wonder where the phrase "comes out of left field comes from" [7,8,9,10].

[7] Cecil probably knows.

[8] As does David Feldman.

[9] Yes, I realize it's probably a baseball phrase.

[10] These days, the Interweb could also
provide me with additional information.  I see that
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_left_field) has some,
including some parts that suggest that no one completely knows.

Calming down
============

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

I started today in a bad mood.  No, strike that.  I started today in a
really bad mood.  I was frustrated about how much non-Fellowship work
is impinging upon my Fellowship time.  I was frustrated by a potential
new policy mentioned in passing at yesterday's faculty meeting (and
confirmed in a follow-up email).  I was frustrated by some of the HR
comments at yesterday's faculty meeting.  I was frustrated [1] by a
variety of issues that I will never post in a public message.

So I started composing email messages.

That's never a good idea.  That is, composing email messages when I am
frustrated and in a bad mood is never a good idea [2].

Amazingly, some voice in the back of my head reminded me of that.  I found 
myself repeatedly starting to write a message, realizing that I needed 
to take a deep breath, and then deleting the message.

And you know what?  I feel much better.  That doesn't mean that I'm
not frustrated by how much non-Fellowship work is impinging upon my
Fellowship time.  That doesn't mean that I'm not frustrated by some of
the other issues.  But I'm not in a bad mood anymore.  And I'm moving
forward.  I even found myself asking others for permission to send
email messages that were not the least bit inflammatory.

I owe that voice in the back of my head a drink, or at least a thank you
note.

Postscript: Surprisingly, last night's [rant about the Web
site](grinnell-web-governance-notes) wasn't affecting me. I've ranted
about that issue so much that another such rant doesn't make me angry,
just sad [3].

---

Postscript: I wrote this musing in the morning because I wanted to get
the feelings down.  My policy is to post in the evening, so I did not
post until a half-day later.

[1] Dear Grammarly, I realize that you want me to vary my word choice.
But I find power and rhythm in repetition.

[2] Well, rarely a good idea.

[3] Well, I'm a bit upset that it's five years of inaction on these
issues.  But I've been worn down.

Planning a sabbatical workspace
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

One of the benefits of my fellowship at the Obermann Center is that
it's helped me think a lot about what I want from my workspace during
sabbatical.  Here's my list.

_Limited distractions_.  While I can often focus for long periods of
time, when I'm struggling to get work done, easy distractions make it
too convenient to step away from the difficulties.  My office at home
and my office at work share some distracting characteristics, such as too
many interesting books.  Both also have their own kinds of distractions.
At home, I might be tempted to take a nap or grab a snack or maybe even
do some housework [1].  At work, it's too easy to walk down the hall
to find someone interesting to talk to.  And, well, it's too easy for
people to find me to talk to.

_Limited email_.  I'm fortunate enough to have an older laptop (circa
2012) along with my "newer" laptop (bought used, but built in 2013).
I've found it useful to run email on one laptop while working on the
other laptop.  Unfortunately, for reasons I don't quite understand,
my newer laptop does better with email.  But most of my intense work
is writing, so it doesn't really matter which one I use.

_Power, computers, and the Internet_.  While I find some benefit to working 
on paper from time to time, most of my writing and thinking happens on
computers.  I also rely on the Internet as a reference.  So it would be
hard to work in a place that did not have easy access to these things.

_The ability to listen to music_.  The Obermann Center policies say that
you're not supposed to play music in your office because sound carries
too easily in the building.  I quickly discovered that I don't work well
in silence.  But I don't like working with headphones or earbuds on [2].
I found out that relatively quiet music does not carry at the Center and
have had background music on for most of the semester.  I don't think I
could do without it.

_Smart people to talk to_.  (Need to fill in more.)

There are also other issues I need to consider for my sabbatical,
particularly how I avoid faculty meetings (and, probably, department
meetings).  I can't shed all of my responsibilities, but I will shed
as many as is feasible.

[2] No, it's not because I tend to pull my computer off the desk when
I stand up with headphones on.

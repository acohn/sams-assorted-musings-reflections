title: Another month of (mostly) daily musings
number: 972
tags: End-of-month musings
---

I've finished another month of what I call daily musings, even
though they are not always musings and they certainly aren't always
daily.  Since it's the end of the eyar, I've also finished another
year of musings.  It's even harder to call them "daily musings"
when I look at the year, since I did not muse for about half of the
year.  Let's just stick with the month.  At the end of most months,
I like to look back at what I've mused [1] about, what I've learned
about writing, and what might be coming in the next month.  I also
try to explore some simple data about the musings.

While most musings are likely to be of broader interest, I assume
that most of my end-of-month musings are mostly of interest to
myself.  But perhaps others learn something from them.

On writing
----------

As far as I can tell, I seem to have settled into a particular
"authorial voice".  Is it different than the voice I had when I
first started musing?  I'm not sure.  I could go back and look,
but I'm not always good at exploring such issues.  I wonder what
criteria I would use?

Toward the end of January, I'll start attending Ralph Savarese's
_Craft of Creative Nonfiction_.  Will my authorial voice change
as a result of attending that course?  It seems that it should, but
I'm not sure how it will.  Or perhaps I'm set enough in my ways
that the primary change we'll see relates to my use [2] of the
English language.  I expect to muse about those issues in the
months to come.

On frequency of posting
-----------------------

I finished last month with some inconsistency in posting.  I had
hoped to be more on top of things at the start of this month, but
I still managed to miss posting on the first three day sof the
month.  I don't recall why.

Once I started posting, often found that I wanted to post multiple 
things each day.  That includes one day when I posted three short
musings.  Maybe I should learn to pace myself.  Certainly, it seemed
that some readers had trouble figuring out which musings were new
when I posted more than one on a single day.

Follow-ups on individual musings
--------------------------------

I had written what I thought was a [light musing on misnaming](misnaming-2019-12-08).  But I got a *lot* of commentary on Facebook.  Clearly, names and
misnaming are things that many people care about, particularly those
who are frequently misnamed.  That commentary led me to plan a [follow-up
musing](misnaming-revisited-2019-12-29).  Surprisingly, it took me three
weeks to finish writing the follow-up; I had planned to post it a day or
two after the original.

My [musing about a bad day](mood-swings-2019-12-16) got a variety
of follow-up comments on Facebook.  In that musing, I commented on
some frustrations with students and some frustrations with
administrative processes regarding major declarations.  Some who
wrote had also had frustrating experiences with students signing
up for things and then not going [3].  Some who commented use an
advising process similar to mine, and often have their students
rewrite declaration essays to ensure that they have thought carefully
about their liberal arts education.  And some posters were worried
about my health [4].

A few days later, I had calmed down, and I realized that I was
likely overreacting.  You can read about the reasons I should not
have been so upset in [a followup musing](getting-better-2019-12-19).
I considered taking down the original, but decided it served a purpose,
if only to remind myself that some days can feel really bad, and that
I need to take a step back and reflect when they do.

After writing about [workload](workload-2019-12-05), I asked a
variety of administrators about how they interpret the requirement
that (approximately) "a four-credit course should require a minimum
of twelve hours of work each week".  Many said it was a pointless
measure, since there are so many variables at play.  But I did have
one particularly scary followup conversation, approximately "If it
says 'minimum', that means that there should be enough work that
*every* student in the course should be spending at least twelve
hours on the class."  That does not bode well for the students who
work less efficiently or face other barriers.  It also doesn't make
sense to me; we transfer four-credit classes from much weaker
institutions, so shouldn't we accept that it's twelve hours for
students at those institutions, not at Grinnell?  I think I agree
with the administrators who suggest that it's a pointless metric.

Broader issues 
--------------

* A colleague who I respect greatly told me that they view my musings
  as a form of leadership because they get people talking about important
  issues on campus [or something like that].
* Period around Christmas in which I wanted to rant, but considered it
  inappropriate.  Ended up doing way too many personal musings.
* I should get to 1000 this month!

Infrastructure
--------------

* Started a new list of musings that are mostly finished, but need
  a bit of editing.  See the counts below.
* New index: Those Wacky Rebelskys.  Decided to add because I was doing enough
  musings about the family.
* Added a "newest first" index.
* I still haven't transitioned to Jekyll, and I may never do so.  But I'd
  like to start automating parts of the site, such as putting.

Looking ahead
-------------

* Trying to figure out when it's okay to start ranting again.

[1] Or ranted.

[2] And abuse.

[3] That wasn't really one of the main points of the musing, but
it's clearly a significant issue on campus, particularly when we've
paid for students to participate in the event.

[4] It turns out that I hurt my leg more than my back when slipping on
the ice.j

Branching
=========

*Trigger warning:  This musing describes software for reporting sexual
assault.*

*Disclaimer: In this musing, I rant about some software design issues.
While they are important to me and therefore the subject of the rant,
I acknowledge that they pale before the severity of sexual assault.
But I still consider it a topic to rant about.*

For the past year, some of my CSC 322 students have been working on a
local version of [Project Callisto](...).  One of the biggest changes
our client requested was "branching", the ability to ask different sets
of questions depending on how the reporter answered earlier questions.
I pushed back a lot on branching.  In part, it was because I thought
adding branching would be difficult and might require some fundamental
changes to the software [1].  So I asked the students to push back a bit
and to figure out *why* the client wanted branching and whether there
might be other reasonable alternatives.

[1] I was right.  Some parts were easy, but we're still struggling with
other parts.

Conflicting calculations
========================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), privilege*

The approval for my sabbatical arrived this morning [1].  My first reaction
was joy; I've been looking forward to a real sabbatical with fewer
on-campus responsibilities [2].  My second reaction was "Wait, they've
computed a different salary percentage than I did."  In particular, I
thought I would be receiving 98.54% of my salary; it turns out that I'm
receiving 98.175% of my salary.  You wouldn't think that 0.365% would
mean that much, but it has a bit of an impact.  And, since numbers were
involved, I was puzzled as to how we got different results.

I did my calculation as follows: My half-year sabbatical is 3 courses.
The College owes me 1.5 courses from my overload in Fall 2017 [3].  I'm
using .427 MAP course credit.  That gives me 4.927 course credits
out of 5.  When I do the math, that's 98.54%.

It took a little bit for me to figure out why the Dean's office came up
with a different number.  Then it dawned on me: They look at the half-year
credit, not the full-year credit.  So, the computation is 50% (half-year
sabbatical) + 50% x 1.927/2.  That gives the 98.175% the Dean reported.

I feel embarassed to have made that mistake.  At least the impact was
comparatively small.  If I only had one course credit, I would have
assumed I'd get 80% of my salary (4/5) but would have received only
75%.  That's a much bigger difference, one that might have led me to
make different decisions.

In any case, I still feel quite privileged to have a job that gives me a
regular sabbatical.

Teaching at Grinnell, Revisited
=========================

There are many reasons that I am fortunate to work at Grinnell,
including the wonderful students I get to teach [1]; the excellent
colleagues I have within and outside the department [2]; a reasonable
salary [3]; the individually mentored curriculum, which ensures that
most students are taking classes because they've decided that those classes
are valuable to their education, rather than because they are forced
to check off a box [5]; and support for creative teaching and innovative
teaching.  

---

[1] Most of them are wonderful.  I will admit that a few are not.

[2] I'm not thrilled with "within and outside" but neither "within 
and without" nor "inside and outside" seems any better.

[3] What makes a salary "reasonable" for a computing professional?  I know
that every year, at least one of our brand-new graduates has a starting
salary that is higher than my salary [4].  I also know that Grinnell is
currently slightly below the median of our peers.  At the same time, I
make more than most Americans, and most Americans make more than most of
the rest of the world.  I live a comfortable life, even though work
is busy.

[4] This year, for the first time, I think they had to count their stock
options to acheive that level.

[5] For those who did not know, Grinnell has no general education requirements;
students are required to take a topical seminar in their first semester,
to meet the requirements for a major, and to take at least 124 credits.
Beyond that, what is in a student's plan is between them and their advisor.

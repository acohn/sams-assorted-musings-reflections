Talking to an alum
==================

We have a Grinnell alum here grading CS Principles.  It was nice catching up.
It was also interesting to hear what the alum wanted to know about.

1010 and, more generally, the loss of self-gov at least in terms of issues
like alcohol.

Posse.

I brought up Ultimate [when I was an undergraduate, the Ultimate players
insisted that they were not Frisbee players.  It's interesting how
things change.  My female ppers also insisted that they be called women
rather than girls [a very reasonable request], but today's college-age
women often refer to themselves and their peers as "girls"..

More conversations?

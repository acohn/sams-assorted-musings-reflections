The cost of attending Grinnell (aka exponential growth)
=======================================================

Today, my assistant and I were doing archival work in my office.
We managed to make it through one box of old stuff from about 2006.
I kept some stuff, but I got rid of much more than I normally would.
I even threw away the one copy I had of a grant proposal that I spent
much of a month writing [1].

As we were doing the archival work, we found a memo from President
Osgood dated March 11, 2002, in which he explains the painful increase
in the comprehensive fee.  My assistant looked at that fee and
said, "That's *half* of what Grinnell costs these days."  And my
assistant is right.  Grinnell's fee of $29,860 for 2002--2003 is
less than half of the [$65,202 that we are charging for 2018--19](https://www.grinnell.edu/news/special-campus-memo-comprehensive-fee-increase-2018-19).
My, that's a terrifyingly large number.

How did we get so high?  Let's suppose that the increment was 5% each
year [2].  Over sixteen years, the fee should have gone up by a
factor of 1.05 to the 16th power.  That's 2.18 times as large.
2.18 * $29,860 is $65,094.  

Ah, the wonders of exponential growth.

Postscript: Grinnell is generous with financial aid, so the vast majority
of our students don't pay anything close to sticker price.  And I'm told
that the average Grinnell student graduates with less debt than the average
attendee at our state institutions.

Postscript: Russell's memo says "Among the top 25 rated U.S. News and
World Report national schools, our comprehensive fee has consistently
ranked in the lowest fifth."  I wonder if that's still the case.

Postscript: As far as I can tell, college costs go up faster than 
inflation and inflation goes up faster than most people's salaries.
Both are problematic issues and are leading to a huge change in
the affordability of college.

That's leading to a very problematic situation.  I don't have a good
solution to that problem.

[1] The proposal was to provide early research opportunities to students
from groups traditionally underrepresented in CS.  But it wasn't funded.
There's no real reason for me to keep it.

[2] It was 5.5% leading into 2002--03.  It was 3.3% leading into 2018--19.

Teaching plans for next year
============================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), end-notable*

I'm on sabbatical.  It's nice to be on sabbatical.  I have more time
to do things.  I can sleep in.  I can pretend that I'm getting more
organized.  But I also miss being in the classroom.  After all, I teach
because I like interacting with students and helping them learn.  So,
I've been thinking about what I'd like to teach next year.

I'll admit that I don't necessarily have complete control over what
I teach.  In Grinnell Department of Computer Science, we try to
allow the younger faculty to choose their courses first, and we try
to plan teaching assignments communally rather than by Chair's fiat.
This year, we also don't yet know who our newest faculty member
will be.  Nonetheless, I'm going to try to pretend that I am able
to plan.

The odds are that I'll be Chair next year.  Jerod is finishing his
three-year stint this year [1].  He does not seem inclined to re-up.
As far as I can tell, I'm the only other member of the department who
is an appropriate candidate [2].  2020-2021 is likely to be a busy
year; we'll have a new member of the department and multiple reviews.
So I'm planning on taking one of my Chair's course reductions.  That
leaves me with four course equivalents to teach.

I'd like to teach Tutorial again.  It's been a decade since I've
taught it last. I've been expecting to teach Tutorial for the past
six years or so, but we've never been able to slot it in.  I'm
still not sure we'll be able to do so next year.  But it makes me
happier to tentatively plan for a Tutorial in Fall 2020 [3].

I'd like to teach at least one section of CSC 151.  I've been working
on a new version of the media computation 151, one that uses the
built-in image tools in DrRacket, rather than the GIMP.  But I
should also teach another section of the Digital Humanities CSC 151
before I switch to another topic.  If I'm teaching only one section
of CSC 151 next year, I'll teach the Digital Humanities version.
If I'm teaching two sections, I'll try to do one of each.  Of course,
it also depends on who else is teaching 151; if the teaching rotation
includes a new faculty member, there's an advantage to being in
sync, so I'll need to make plans with them.

I want to teach CSC 281, _Learning from Alumni_, and CSC 282,
_Thinking in C and Linux_, again. I also _should_ teach them again;
it's been too long since we've been able to offer them, and we will
probably have to drop them from the books if we don't offer them
next year.  Each is a one-credit course, so I still have room for
other courses.

Speaking of courses that we haven't offered in a while, we should
probably offer a section of CSC 232, _Human-Computer Interaction_,
a two-credit course.  While we have an HCI and Languages course this
spring, that's not the same as a plain HCI course.  I'm not sure who
else would want to teach it, and I think it would be a nice challenge.
It's also a two-credit course, so it pairs nicely with the
two one-credit courses.  Of course, if I'm going to teach it, I should
spend part of spring term this year planning the course.

What else?  While the Technology Studies concentration is going
away, there are plans to keep offering TEC 154.  I know that no one
else is available next year, so I seem to be the primary option if
we want it offered.  I'm not sure why, but I'd like to teach it
again, if the department can spare me.

I think that's it.  At first glance, my preferred schedule would
be Tutorial, CSC 151, CSC 281, CSC 282, CSC 232, and TEC 154.  That
has half of my courses outside the department.  That's a lot.  If
I can only teach one non-CS course, I'd rather teach Tutorial than
TEC 154.  That choice would likely give me a schedule of Tutorial,
CSC 151, and CSC 281 in the fall, and CSC 151, CSC 232, and CSC 282
in the spring.

Of course, those are only tentative plans.  As I said, we plan
courses as a department, and we give priority to the younger faculty.
Someone else may want to teach CSC 232.  I may have to teach CSC
324 [4] because we need to offer three sections annually and one
of the two faculty members who currently teach it may be on leave
next year.  Or maybe someone else will want to pick it up.  We'll
see.  If I do have to teach CSC 324, it would likely replace the
spring CSC 151 and CSC 232 in the schedule, unless there's no one
else to teach CSC 232, in which case I'd likely teach a 4.5 load.

What will my plan look like in a month or two?  I'll likely have
the same preferences.  We're supposed to get the list of Tutorial
faculty to the Dean by January 24, so I guess I'll know before then.
When do classes start?  January 21.  I expect we'll have to make
some decisions about who teaches what during the week before classes
start.  Of course, we don't vote on the Chair until sometime in the
middle of the spring semester [5].  Still, I think it's safe to work
under the assumption that I'll be Chair, and I hope that helps things
fall into place.

Postscript: If you read through to the end of the end notes, you'll
see that I spent a lot of time looking at policies in the _Faculty
Handbook_ and elsewhere.  Is there something wrong with me that I
care about these details?

---

[1] It's hard to believe that those three years passed so quickly.

[2] The _Faculty Handbook_ says "Department chairs ordinarily should
be elected or appointed from among the Regular faculty of the
department who hold the rank of associate professor or professor
and who have not acquired Senior Faculty Status."  Jerod and I are
the only members of the department that that sentence currently
describes.

[3] I'll muse about topics for that Tutorial separately.

[4] I hope not.

[5] I should be able to find that information in the _Faculty
Handbook_.  I thought it was in the schedule of elections, which
is on pages 4 and 5 in the _Handbook_.  Yes, it is.  The order is
(i) Chair of the Faculty, (ii) Division Chairs, (iii) Divisional
representatives to the Faculty Personnel Committee and Curriculum
Committee, (iv) a Member-at-Large of the Executive Council, (v) a
Member-at-Large of the Faculty Personnel Committee, (vi) Department
Chairs, and (vii) the Chair-elect [6] of the Faculty Organization
Committee.  There are more that follow, but my concern was Department
Chair.

When do those various elections happen?  Conveniently, the timing
is in the _Handbook_, too, immediately following the schedule of
elections.  The Chair of the Faculty is elected in a week-long
process that starts at the first regular faculty meeting in February.
All of the Divisional positions are elected the following week in
Division meetings.  The two Members-at-Large are elected at the
following faculty meeting [8].  The Chair-elect of FOC is elected
at the first faculty meeting after break [9].  That means that the
broad time frame for electing the Department Chair this coming spring
is after February 21st (the conclusion of at-large elections) and
before April 6th (the first meeting after spring break).

I expect that Jerod will hear a more precise request from
the Dean's office [10].

Since the schedule of courses for the spring is also due on February
21, it's clear that we'll need to make tentative plans even before we
elect a Chair [12].

[6] Why is it "Chair-elect" rather than "Chair-Elect" given that we
use "Member-at-Large" rather than "Member-at-large"?  I don't know [7].

[7] Insert standard statement about hobgoblins' minds, or some such.

[8] Strictly speaking, they are not elected at the faculty meeting.
Rather, they are nominated at the faculty meeting and then elected
by ballot during the following week.  That holds for the Chair of the
Faculty, too.  In contrast, we do the full elections at Division Meetings.

[9] Why don't we do the FOC Chair-elect election at the third meeting
of spring semester, rather than the one that falls after break?
I'm not sure.

[10] Or perhaps not.  I can't recall if "notify the Dean of the
results of the Department Chair election" is one of those things
we're reminded about.  It's not in the [list of Faculty Dates to
Remember](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Lists/FacDates/Deadlines.aspx) [11], and I'm too lazy to look at notes from past years.

[11] Of course, neither is "Submit the list of Tutorial Faculty to
the Dean's Office".

[12] Didn't we try to set up the timing of elections so that all
of the ones that involved course reductions would be completed
before the schedule of courses was due?  I guess not.  At least
there's time to make changes before the final version of the schedule
goes out on the first day after break.

Recovering from September 1
===========================

In [a recent musing](dreading-1-sept-2017), I wrote about the wide
variety of things that I had to write before September 1.  I've now
made it to September 2.  Let's see where we are on all of this.

_A tenure/promotion review for a colleague at another institution_.
Amazingly, I finished a strong draft early so that I would have some
time away from it before submitting a final version.  As I noted,
tenure/promotion reviews are one of the largely uncompensated pieces of
service we all do.  But it's interesting to see what other faculty are
doing and it's always interesting to read their papers.  And that's all
I'm saying.  (I guess that I can say that it was about 1,600 words.)
**Done!**

_Readings for week 2 of CSC 151._  Um, well, let's see.  I finished the
reading and lab on lists (3,000 words and 1,300 words, respectively).
We held that lab on September 1.   I finished the reading and lab
on procedures (1,500 words each).  We'll do that lab on Monday [1].
I also wrote a bunch of supporting code and documentation (not counted).
We needed to rearrange the schedule anyway, so Wednesday will be a reading
on pair programming from the literature.  But I should get cracking on
Friday's reading on Documentation.  **Failed!**

_A paper submission for SIGCSE [1] with my students on the "Data Science
for Social Good" code camp._  My students worked hard on this paper and
even had a schedule in which a draft would be ready on Tuesday night.
But they had trouble writing.  I had trouble finding time to write
this paper [2].  And so when I sat down to finish it on the evening
of September 1, there was a *lot* of work left to do.  Plus, I had
to get it to format with the new ACM LaTeX style [3].  I wrote a lot.
The final paper has about 4,500 words.  The "vomit draft" [5] that they
wrote had 3,000.  But I edited a lot of the words.  Counting those words
is hard.  Let's pretend that I wrote 3,000.  **Done!**

_An application for an Obermann Fellowship_.  I'm not sure what the odds
are that I can get an Obermann Fellowship, but it's worth a try to have
a semester to work on a new, digital-humanities focused, CSC 151.  The
four or so pages took a few hours.  Rewriting after valuable feedback 
took a few more.  And cutting the CV down from seventeen pages to five
was an interesting exercise.  I submitted this at about 5:30 p.m. on
the due date.  I got an immediate email reply: "I am out of the office
until Tuesday".  Why was this due on Friday, anyway?  This was 2,500
words.  **Done!**

_My musing on "[one year of daily musings](one-year)"_.  I felt a bit
bad working on this rather than on my students' paper.  But I knew
I would feel equally bad if I didn't get it posted.  And, hey,
I always do my SIGCSE papers at the last second.   This musing was
1,400 words.  An accompanying musing on "[thirteen months of daily
musings](thirteen-months)" [6] was another 1,100 words.  **Done!**

_A paper submission for SIGCSE with my colleagues on our new functional
data-science-oriented introduction to computer science._  I don't envy
my colleagues.  I didn't warn them I was going to put them on the paper,
or even that I was going to write the paper.  They offered to help.  I
turned it down.  And the draft got done at the last minute.  Or maybe
it didn't get done. **???**

_A paper submission for SIGCSE with my students on their "Craft of Code"
camp._  While the students worked hard on this camp, none of us had time
to work hard on this paper.  I don't think anything got drafted.  So,
by the time I finished dealing with the data science for social good
camp, I decided to withdraw this one.  **Withdrawn!**

_Bidding on papers for SIGCSE_.  I'm not surethat I'm up to bidding.  I
realize that if I don't bid, I'll probably get the dregs.  But someone
has to get the dregs.  And I find that I learn something even when I 
meta-review weak papers.  **Dropped**

How much did I write over the past five days, not including some of the
musings?  Let's see ... 1,600 + 3,000 + 1,300 + 1,500 + 1,500 + 3,000 +
2,500 + 1,400 + 1,100 + ???.  That's 16,900 + ??? words.  Not too shabby.
And that doesn't count most of the musings, including the 1,100 or so
words in this musing.

What comes next?

_Another week of readings for CSC 151_.  Let's see ... that week includes
the delayed work on documentation, testing, debugging, and tables and
compound data [n].  For the reading on documentation, I can probably
borrow from a past reading.  The testing reading will probably need to 
be new or at least the lab will; there was a lab that worked great in
concept and horribly in practice.  I had revised it to one that worked
reasonably well in practice, but that one depends on various color procedures
that we are not teaching this semester.  The debugging reading is brand
new.  I also have to learn how to debug in DrRacket [n].  And the tables
and compound data reading is completely new.  Oh, I should probably write
something about data science, too.

[n] I'm not really a debugger person.  I like to look at my code and 
think through what the issues might be.  But I think students benefit
from good debuggers.

[n] "tables and compound data" is a single reading.

_Delayed proposals to send students to Tapia_.  We've bought the tickets
under the assumption that I'll find funding.  I should apply for that 
funding asap.

And there's a host of non-writing tasks.  But at least there aren't 
deadlines, other than self-imposed deadlines.

[1] What, you think Monday is Labor Day in the US?  It is.  But we still
teach.  I don't really mind.  I have so many privileges; it's okay not
to have this one.

[2] Other writing and sleep ended up taking priority, as did class
preparation.

[3] I considered using the new [ACM Microsoft Word
Style](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template), but that
was just terrifying.  Why are there different versions for Windows Word,
Mac Word 2011, and Mac Word 2016 [4]?

[4] I hear that Mac Word 2011 is going away, or at least updates are
going way.  I suppose I'll have to switch to 2016.  I hope it's improved
since it first came out.

[5] Their name, not mine.

[6] Don't ask.

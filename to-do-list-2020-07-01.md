As my [sabbatical](sabbatical-report-2020-06-30) wraps up [1] and
my other jobs ramp up [2], it seems that I must return to the task
of keeping track of my tasks.  I've tried a number of approaches
to to-do lists over the years.  I've used business-card-sized pieces
of papers.  I've used a text file.  I've used a notebook I keep in
my pocket.  I've sent myself daily emails.  A few years ago, when
I was feeling particularly [overcommitted](index-overcommitment),
I started to use [Todoist](https://todoist.com).  I've been a bit
more casual during sabbatical; I could keep track of the most
important tasks in my head.  This summer, I've supplemented my head
with notepads.  I like notepads.  I can cross things off.  I can
review and rewrite.  But software is nice because I can access it
almost anywhere.  That is, I usually have my so-called "Smart Phone"
with me when I'm out and about and I do most of my work on the
computer, where it's also available.

Yesterday, I realized that I needed to settle down and choose what
I wanted to do.

Anxious and overwhelmed.

Need to choose how.

Software: Prioritizes, keeps track of dates, stuff like that.  Keeps
track of what I've done.  But I never really go back and look.
Sometimes feels overwhelming (is that the software or is that the
amount of outstanding work).  Permits reorganization (all things
marked as "email" or "short").

Note cards.  I like dealing with physical objects.  Easier to review.
I can carry some with me.  Some things are small enough that it's
not worth bringing up a to-do-list manager.  Open/unstructured. I
can draw, fold, add whatever notes I want.

Too much comes in.  Inbox zero at 11pm on Monday night.  120 or so
messages in my inboxes by noon Tuesday.  Some are easy to read and
delete.  Others need more response time.  Things also come to mind
much too frequently.

Too much also comes in to my head.  And things leave my head too
quickly.  All releated.

What will I do?  I think I'm going to try note pads and note cards.  Task 
board: The sticky notes [3] worked much better.  Note pads for quick lists.
Note cards for when I need to organize.

[1] One could argue it wrapped up in March when I started helping Jerod
with Chair duties.  It definitely wrapped up in May, when my summer students
started.

[2] See previous endnote.

[3] I can't be sure that they were post-it brand.

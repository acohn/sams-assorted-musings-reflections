Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Clair Patterson '43
=================================================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnellians](index-grinnellians), science*

As someone who loves Grinnell and the people who inhabit or have inhabited
its confines, I consider it my responsibility to introduce folks to
other Grinnellians they may not know.  In the past, I've written about
historical Grinnellians, like [Hallie Flanagan 1911](hallie-flanagan)
or [Grant Gale](grant-gale), and current Grinnellians, like [Erik
Simpson](erik-simpson).

Recently, I learned about a Grinnellian *I* should have known about,
but did not.  I am thankful to Mitch Erickson '72 for telling me about
Clair Patterson '43.  Patterson earned an A.B. [1] in Chemistry from
Grinnell, a Master's degree from Iowa, and a Ph.D. from the University
of Chicago.

Afterwards, one of Patterson's first major accomplishments was to
determine the age of the earth.  As I understand it, he did so looking
at lead isotope data from iron meteorites.  And, as far as I can tell,
his estimate of 4.55 billion years has stood the test of time [3], give
or take a few million years.  I appreciate what his biographer, George
R. Tilton says that Patterson said after the discovery,

> True scientific discovery renders the brain incapable at such moments of shouting vigorously to the world "Look at what I've done! Now I will reap the benefits of recognition and wealth." Instead such discovery instinctively forces the brain to thunder "*We* [4] did it" in a voice no one else can hear, within its sacred, but lonely, chapel of scientific thought. [5]

In studying lead, Patterson came to discover that our industrial processes
were adding significantly to the amount of lead in the environment, and
that the additional lead was a risk to human beings.  By the mid-1960's,
he was pushing for a change in lead usage and being heavily criticized
for his perspectives.  He pushed for improvement  on controls on lead in
the air, in food, and in gasoline.  He participated in a 1978 National
Research Council panel on lead that expressed concerns.  However, he
did not consider that enough.  Tells us that,

> In his lengthy 78-page minority report Patterson argued that the majority report was not forceful enough. Basically he said that the dangers of the prevalent practices were already clearly enough defined and that efforts should start immediately to drastically reduce or completely remove industrial lead from the everyday environment. That included gasoline, food containers, foils, paint, and glazes. He also cited water distribution systems. He urged "investigations into biochemical perturbations within cells caused by lead exposures ranging down from typical to 1/1000 of typical." He had long criticized assigning a sharp limit for lead in air or blood to denote a dividing line between poisonous and non-poisonous levels.

While Patterson was not the only voice to call for lead reduction, he
was undoubedly one of the most distinguished scientists to do so, and he
took a clear lead in these matters, drawing deeply on his scholarship.
In doing so, he exemplifies our goal of preparing students "who are
prepared in life and work to use their knowledge and their abilities to
serve the common good" [6,7].

Postscript: The more I think about Patterson, the more impressed I am.
Just imagine what it must be like to know that you computed the age of
the earth and that that's not the most important work you've done.

Postscript: I'm surprised to see that there seem to be two spellings of
Patterson's first name.  His [biographical memoir from the National
Academy of Sciences](https://www.nap.edu/read/6201/chapter/16) lists
him as "Clair Cameron Patterson", as does [his Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson).  However, his [paper on the age
of the earth](https://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/~rcoe/eart206/Patterson_AgeEarth_GeoCosmoActa56.pdf) lists him as "Claire Patterson" (note the added "e"), as
does [_The Des Moines Register_](https://data.desmoinesregister.com/famous-iowans/claire-patterson).

[1] It makes me happy to know that Grinnell used to use the Latin
ordering for academic degrees (*artium baccalaureus*, I believe).
It's what Chicago used when I was there [2].

[2] That is, I have an S.B. and an S.M. in addition to my Ph.D.  

[3] Well, a bit more than a half century, comparatively little with
regards to his estimate.

[4] Tilton tells us that 

> "we" refers to what Patterson calls "the generations-old community of scientific minds."

in 1943.

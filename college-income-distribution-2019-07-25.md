Income distributions, college attendance, and such
==================================================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia), data junkie*

A few years ago, the _New York Times_
published an interactive data set entitled
"[Some Colleges Have More
Students From the Top 1 Percent
Than the Bottom 60](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html)".  I keep getting
sent back to that data set, whether it be in a talk at the Tapia Celebration,
a reading group on _The Privileged Poor_ [1], or a [a crappy article from
_Medium_](https://medium.com/s/no-mercy-no-malice/how-i-got-here-eb3ca0aa98d2) [2].  Today I decided to a slightly deepr dive into the data.

It's depressing to see how many of our peers appear at the top of
the list.  Colorado College is second, with 24.2% of their students in
the studied group from the top 1% and 10.5% of their students from the
bottom 60%.  Washington and Lee is third, with 19.1% from the top 1% and 8.4 from the
bottom 60% [3].  Kenyon is eighth, with 19.8% from the top 1% and 12.2 from
the bottom 65%.

How about Grinnell?  Let's see.  We are 182nd, with 5.5% of our students 
from the top 1% [4] and 24.6% from the bottom 60%.    I wonder where
we rank relative to the comparison group we use for various studies [9].
Let's see.

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Rank</th>
    <th>Institution</th>
    <th>Top 1%</th>
    <th>Bottom 60%</th>
    <th>Ratio</th>
  </tr>

  <tr> <td>002</td><td>Colorado</td><td>24.2</td><td>10.5</td> <td>2.30</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>003</td><td>Washington and Lee</td><td>19.1</td><td>8.4</td> <td>2.27</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>008</td><td>Kenyon</td><td>19.8</td><td>12.2</td> <td>1.62</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>025</td><td>Bowdoin</td><td>20.4</td><td>17.5</td> <td>1.17</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>033</td><td>Davidson</td><td>17.4</td><td>16.4</td> <td>1.06</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>042</td><td>Carleton</td><td>14.4</td><td>15.5</td> <td>0.93</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>044</td><td>Williams</td><td>18.1</td><td>19.6</td> <td>0.92</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>047</td><td>Amherst</td><td>21.1</td><td>24.4</td> <td>0.86</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>066</td><td>Oberlin</td><td>9.3</td><td>13.3</td> <td>0.70</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>071</td><td>Pomona</td><td>14.2</td><td>21.8</td> <td>0.65</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>082</td><td>St. Olaf</td><td>8.3</td><td>15.3</td> <td>0.54</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>096</td><td>Swarthmore</td><td>9.0</td><td>18.2</td> <td>0.49</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>109</td><td>Reed</td><td>7.8</td><td>18.0</td> <td>0.43</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>126</td><td>Vassar</td><td>9.3</td><td>26.1</td> <td>0.36</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>140</td><td>Macalester</td><td>6.8</td><td>22.0</td> <td>0.31</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>182</td><td>Grinnell</td><td>5.5</td><td>24.6</td> <td>0.22</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>230</td><td>Smith</td><td>4.4</td><td>27.2</td> <td>0.16</td></tr>
</table>

We're almost at the bottom.  In some sense, that's good; we're serving
an implicit part of our mission to provide a top-quality undergraduate
education to students who could not otherwise afford such an education.
The comparatively small percentage of those from the top 1% may also be
a good thing in other ways; it means that students are less comfortable
with open displays of wealth, something that can make other students
feel like outsiders [10].

There are, of course, some significant disadvantages associated with
having limited numbers of students from the top 1%: Growing funds.
Not surprisingly, as you look to grow the endowment [12] you're much more
likely to get large donations from that group.

Selectivity indices

<table class="table">
  <tr> <th>Institution</th> <th>Selectivity</th> <th>US News Rating</th>
  <tr> <td>Amherst</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Bowdoin</td> <td>1</td> <td>5</td> </tr>

Fascinating.  In spite of being less selective than most of these institutions,
we rank better than five of the higher-selectivity institutions.  I wonder
if we are the highest ranked "selectivity 2" institution.  Let's see.
What are the other top schools on the _US News_ top-twenty list?

<table class="table">
  <tr> <td>Wellesley</td> <td>1</td> <td>3</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Middlebury</td> <td>1</td> <td>5</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Claremont McKenna</td> <td>1</td> <td>9</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Haverford</td> <td>1</td> <td>11</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Colgate</td> <td>1</td> <td>16</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Hamilton</td> <td>1</td> <td>16</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Colby</td> <td>1</td> <td>18</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Harvey Mudd</td> <td>1</td> <td>18</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>United States Military Academy</td> <td>18</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Wesleyan (CT)</td> <td>1</td> <td>18</td> </tr>
</table> 

Okay, we're the highest-ranked "selectivity 2"
institution in the top twenty.  How far down do we have
to go to reach the next one?  Mount Holyoke, at 30 [N].  After
that, it's Lafayette at 36.
Hmmm ... does _US News_ use selectivity?  Their [description of their
methodology](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings)
doesn't suggest that they look at yield, which I assume is a core aspect
of the Barron's study.  Strange.  Ah!  They've removed it.  But they do
write "A school's academic atmosphere is influenced by the selectivity
of its admissions" and they do take both grades and standardized scores
into account.

[1] Musing coming soon.

[2] I might also muse about this article.  From my perspective, it
falls into the "clueless academic at elite institution" category.
But what do I know?

[3] When last I visited, they seemed to have a very active cadre of
QuestBridge scholars.  But I guess that doesn't have as much of an impact
as I would have guessed.

[4] I wonder if that counts our international students [5].  While
Grinnell has a share of full-pay students, I also think of us as making
an important difference to students who are unlikely to be full pay, some
of whom are here on full-ride scholarships.

[5] _The Times_ [6] says that "The researchers tracked about 30 million students born between 1980 and 1991, linking anonymized tax returns to attendance records from nearly every college in the country."  So it sounds like it's only
US students [7].

[6] Should that be "_The Times_" or "The _Times_"?  I've seen both used.

[7] Let's do some WAG [8] estimates.  About 20% of our students are 
classified as "international students".  Let's assume that half of those 
are 1%'ers (probably an excessive estimate) and the rest are bottom
60% (possibly also an excesive estimate).  That would give us about
14.4% in the top 1% and about 29.7% in the bottom 60%, moving our
ratio from 0.22 to 0.48, fairly close to Swarthmore's.  If we assume that
1/4 were 1%'ers and 1/4 were bottom 60%, we'd get 9.4% vs. 24.7%, we
get a ratio of 0.38. somwehere between Mac and Vassar.  Of course, we'd also
need to do the analysis for all of those institutions.  

[8] Wild-Ass Guess

[9] Peer institution list taken from <https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/institutional-research/resources>.

[10] At least that's my take from reading _The Privileged Poor_.  Of course,
that book looks at the kind of wealth that you see at places like Amherst
and Harvard [11].

[11] I was surprised to see that Harvard has both a smaller percentage from
the top 1% (15.1%) and from the bottom 60% (20.4%) than Amherst.

[12] And yes, it's important to grow the endowment.  Ours may be huge, but
it's that huge endowment that allows us to simultaneously provide a high-end
undergraduate education while remaining need-blind in admissions and
meeting full demonstrated financial need [14].

[14] Yes, I realize that "full demonstrated financial need" is a complicated
proposition and that most students do not feel like we do enough.

[N] A [recent study](https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2019/usnews-discrepancy.html) suggests that Reed belongs at #36 and that _US News_ is
punishing them for not participating in the study.

[N] Soka is ranked 22 but is not on the list of Barron's selectivity
ratings that I found.

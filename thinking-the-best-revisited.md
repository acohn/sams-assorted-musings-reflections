Thinking the Best of Others, Revisited
======================================

*Forthcoming.*

---

Notes:

In [an earlier essay](thinking-the-best.html), I claimed that my mother
always thought the best of other people.  Mom's friend, Lynn Dorman,
quickly disabused me of that view, noting that mom regularly ranted
about John Silber and BU administrators.  But I still remember many times
when we were talking about something someone did that made us upset,
and mom would say "Let's think about why they might have done that."
So, maybe I can say that mom thought the best of other people, but didn't
qualify John Silber and some administrators as people [1].

Moving on ...

Reading a book on Buddhist practices [explain why].  First practice is
to find something good in each person you meet.  (Okay, not quite that
simple.) ...

So maybe I have been doing the right thing.

Thanks mom!

[1] Don't worry, Rachel, even though you've decided to play John Silber
in these essays, I do think of you as a person.

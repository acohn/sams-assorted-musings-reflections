I'm on sabbatical.  That means that I should be avoiding work,
particularly service work for the College [1].  Nonetheless, I keep
getting requests to do things at the College and elsewhere.  And
it appears that I'm too used to giving the incorrect answer.  Will
you run a Faculty/Staff Friday?  Yes.  Will you give a talk on the
History of Tutorial?  Yes.  Will you be the treasurer for my campaign?
Yes.  Do you want to be involved in Tapia?  Yes.  Will I meet with
my Dean to discuss belonging, inclusion, and persistence?  Of course.

It's actually worse than that.  My personality is such that I'm
also tempted to volunteer to do things.  The fall of 2021 represents
the 50th anniversary of the first Tutorial.  Can I be involved in
the planning?  I hear that we're once again going to try to rewrite
the _Faculty Handbook_ this coming summer.  Can I be a part of that?

So I need to learn how to say "No", or perhaps words and phrases
like "No", since that word seems so difficult to me.  Will you meet
with this student group?  Sorry, but I'm too busy right now.  Will
you supervise a MAP or independent?  My schedule is iffy enough
that I don't think it would be fair to you.  Will you write me a
letter of recommendation?  I haven't taught you in a year or more,
wouldn't someone else be better [2].  Wouldn't you like to go to a
two-day retreat on assessment?  Sorry, I'll be out of town [3,4].

But I'm not good at separation.  I still seem to be attending
department, division, and faculty meetings.  But that's partially
because I don't think I can complain about things unless I've been
part of the discussion.  Way too much seems to happen each year and
I'd rather observe what goes on and be able to insert my point of
view.  For example, I missed the December 2 Faculty Meeting because
of a conflict, and because there was nothing particularly controversial
on the schedule [5].  Yet there was a discussion of end-of-course
evaluations for the First-Year Experience which didn't appear on
the agenda, and I don't like the direction we went.  The vote two
decades ago was to have the same end-of-course evaluation for every
course but Tutorial.  FYE should have the same evaluation form
[7,9].

Whoops.  I didn't mean for this to deteriorate into a rant.  And
didn't I say that I shouldn't complain about things unless I
participate in the discussion?

Maybe I should just say "No" to caring about this stuff [10].

[1] It's hard to take a sabbatical from my responsibilities to my
profession.  But I suppose I could learn to say no to those things,
too.  The biggest issue is that most are multi-year commitments.

[2] Yes, I'm still writing some letters.  I'm just trying to keep the
number down.

[3] That's true.

[4] There are years in which I would try to reschedule my obligations
to make the assessment workshop.

[5] The agenda had an opportunity to approve the minutes of the
prior meeting, an update on restorative justice work, a vote on the
Digital Studies Concentration, a debrief about the second-year
retreat, and remarks from the President, Dean, and Chair of the
Faculty.  I sent my comments on the minutes [6] and my proxy for the
Digital Studies Concentration.  I figured I could read about the
other two issues in the minutes.

[6] Perhaps we'll get to approve those minutes at the first meeting
of the new year.

[7] I heard that at least one argument was that the staff teaching
the course didn't have a say in the design of the evaluation form.
Even if the regular faculty teaching the course didn't design or
approve the form, they do have authority over it.  But if staff
members are teaching a credit-bearing course, they are temporarily
acting as faculty [8], and so their teaching should be reviewed in the
same way as faculty.  

[8] Right now, the FYE is an experimental course.  If staff are
going to teach the FYE over the longer term, we will have to
officially designate them as faculty.

[9] Because the College didn't use the official EOCE form for the FYE,
the forms they did use are not available for department chairs to peruse,
and reviewing EOCEs is supposed to be one of the chairs' responsibilities.

[10] No, that's not gonna happen.

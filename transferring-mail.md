Transferring Mail
=================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email), rambly, notes to myself*

One of the disadvantages of switching between laptops is keeping things
coherent between the laptops.  I'll write (or I've written) more about
the general issue.  Today I'm considering email.

You think email would be easy.  As long as the email program is open
and you keep your email on the server [1], the local versions should
remain in synch.

But it's never as easy as it should be.

One problem is the way that Mail.app works on Macs.  I've found that
when I have it open on multiple Macs, it either starts to complain or it
screws up [2].  Because of that, I've been slow in switching back to my
newer MacBook from my [vintage MacBook](old-or-vintage).  Given that my
"new" MacBook has been "off email" for a few months, I've worried about
the time and complexity of downloading all of the new messages.  
I thought about copying all of the messages from my vintage MacBook to
a hard drive and then to the newer MacBook.  My primary worry was about
the cost of dealing with all of the updates when I'd declared [inbox
bankruptcy](inbox-zero-revisited-01).  But I decided to give it
a try.  But it appears that I'd updated the mail on my newer MacBook
since then.  Fortunately, there were only 8187 new messages to download.

Then there's the issue of the mail filters.  I've been writing a number
of filters recently to ensure that less useful mail stays out of my inbox.
Fortunately, I can find those.

`~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData/SyncedRules.plist`.  

Let's hope that copying things back and forth helps.

Of course, having Mail on only one machine can be helpful.  I've been
trying to focus more on my work by using one laptop for writing and
one for email.

Folders don't appear in the same order.  Bleh.  (Why are my new folders
at the end rather than in alphabetical order?)

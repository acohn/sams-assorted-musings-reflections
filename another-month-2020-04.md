It's the beginning of May.  My end-of-month musing is slightly
overdue.  However, yesterday I felt like writing about [card
games](claviash-2020-04-30) rather than reflecting on the past
month of musing.  In any case, it seems like it's time to reflect
on the past month of musing.  For those who are new to the musings
and those whose memories are like mine, the end-of-month musing is
an opportunity to look back on what I've learned or done or something
like that.  In the early days of SamR's Assorted Rants and Musings,
I found that I was regularly discovering new things about my writing.
These days, things seem a bit more static [1].

Let's start off with something easy: Counting the number of musings
I've written.  My [previous end-of-month musing](another-month-2020-03)
was musing #1035.  This one is musing #1060.  I posted twenty-four
musings and rants in a month with thirty days.  That's not quite 
"daily" but it's better than "weekdaily" and it's much better than
I was doing in the past few months [2].  Why didn't I post daily?
A few times, I wrote a musing and then decided that it was not 
appropriate to post.  I think one of those was a rant and one or
two were comments on the pandemic.  A few times, I wasn't up to 
writing at the end of the day.  I'll accept twenty-four.

How did I get myself to re-devote myself to musing?  At the start
of the month, I shaved my head.  The top of my head is still shaved,
but I've started to let my beard grow back [3].  Now, it would not
seem that a head shave would make a difference to how I write.  But
I shaved it, in part, to get myself to approach the world differently.
So for the first week or two, I could say to myself "You shaved your
head.  You can push yourself to do anything [4]."  It seemed to help.
I'm still not productive enough, but I do spend most of my days working
on things, and I did muse.  I might even continue shaving my head
if I was a bit more successful at keeping flesh while removing hair.

It also helped that I had two manuscripts due for _The Craft of
Creative Nonfiction_ last month.  You might think that spending time
writing and editing, particularly writing and editing prose that must
be significantly better than these musings, would leave me little time
to muse.  And you'd probably be right.  But each manuscript represents
a portion of two or three or possibly more musings: The assignment
I've written for myself, the manuscript I write in response, perhaps
some notes on development or on what I've learned in workshop.  It adds
up.  I do add a bit more to each musing; it's not just cut, paste, and
reformat.  But it gets stuff out there.  For those who care, the 
CoCN musings I've identified for the past month are as follows

* [Another assignment for The Craft of Creative Nonfiction](eng207-2b-assignment) (Musing #1040)
* [My second manuscript for The Craft of Creative Nonfiction](eng207-2b-manuscript) (Musing #1041)
* [Drafting my third essay for The Craft of Creative Nonfiction](eng207-3b-drafting) (Musing #1055)
* [My third assignment for The Craft of Creative Nonfiction](eng207-3b-assignment) (Musing #1057)
* [Innumeracy (my latest manuscript for The Craft of Creative Nonfiction)](eng207-3b-manuscript) (Musing #1058)

I also wrote one more musing related to that class, one in which
[I ranted about the stylistic comments the editors had made for one
of our readings](the-wrong-stuff-2020-04-14).  So fully one-fourth of
my musings were directly related to that class.  What will I do when
it's done?

Other topics for the month included some reflections on how the pandemic
affects teaching, advising, Grinnell, me, stuff, like that.  I wonder
what they will read like in a few years.  I never got around to musing
about Microsoft Teams [5,6], which was one of the related topics.  Maybe 
I'll do that next month.  I also wrote a bit about the online meetings
I've been having with prospective or admitted students.  I didn't get to
do online meetings with parents of prospective or admitted students.  I
wonder if we'll add those as an option in the future [7].

This was also a month in which I got to post my amazing [reflections
on prereg](post-prereg-2020F).  It remains a popular topic for some
folks and an utter bore to others.  From [what I can
tell](post-prereg-questions-2020-04-27), those who like it appreciate
the narrative approach to the data or like seeing their names.  Speaking
of popular topics, I don't think anyone has ever said "Your end-of-month
musings are my favorite."  I wouldn't expect them to.

That's about it for the patterns of musing.  I'm going to skip the
traditional "How many sketches remain in the 'sketchbook'" data
analysis.

Perhaps I should look forward to the coming month.  I have one or two
email messages I've sent to students that might become musings.  I
do want to look at Teams.  More broadly, I might muse about techniques
to support pair programming in 151 and elsewhere if we have to
continue with remote learning [8,10].  I'm tempted to give a partial
view of this semester's cut-close-balance experience for CS, just
because I think it's so stupid to force us to do CCBs at all.  Oh,
speaking of stupid, I'm considering posting my sarcastic rewriting
of our "technological minimalism" policies [11].  Let's see how
grumpy I get.

I'll report back next month.  Perhaps I'll even take advantage of
some of the things I've learned in _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_.
Stay tuned.

[1] Given my experience with Blackboard Collaborate Ultra, "static"
seems to be a good way to describe my speaking voice.

[2] Thirty musings in February and March.

[3] Middle says that he'd prefer the reverse.  My beard is, shall we
say, sparse and scraggly.

[4] Or at least anything stupid.

[5] No, not teams of people at Microsoft.  Rather, the product from
Microsoft called "Teams" [6].

[6] That reminds me, I need to set up one more Microsoft email account
so that I can set up an external team.

[7] While I hope we never again have to do an exclusively remote
prospective program, I can see some benefits for retaining some of
the practices.

[8] That will, of course, require that I do some exploration of
options for remote pair programming, particularly pair programming
for 151.  The late and lamented c9.io was great for pair programming
in 321/322 [9], but is no longer available.  My initial experiments
with Pair Programming with DrRacket in Teams have not gone well.
Someone suggested Microsoft VScode, which seems to be open source.
There's even a [Racket
plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evzen-wybitul.magic-racket).  Repl.It doesn't seem to support Racket.  Hmmm.  I don't think
wescheme.org supports screen sharing and it also doesn't support
full Racket.  Whoops!  I think that's all supposed to be part of the
musing.

[9] Also late, not so lamented.

[10] The department did propose a version of 151 for the summer.  We
probably have to figure things out relatively soon.

[11] The College is imposing technological minimalism on a department
that both teaches and relies heavily on technology.  Would they
expect, say, biological minimalism in biology, linguistic minimalism
in English, artistic minimalism in studio art and art history,
periodic [12] minimalism in history, and so on and so forth? [15]

[12] w.c. [14]

[14] "w.c." stands for "word choice", not "water closet".

[15] I understand and support many of the reasons that the College has
asked faculty to be more cautious in the use of software.  And I've found
ITS to be quite responsive.  But a broad insistence on a policy without
considering the pedagogical implications seems problematic.

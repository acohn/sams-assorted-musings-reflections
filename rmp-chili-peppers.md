Rate your professors' ... Hotness?
==================================

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), short*

For a number of years, the Web site [Rate My
Professors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) has provided a way for
students to provide shared feedback about their classes.  It should not
be surprising that such a site exists; many schools have both formal
and informal rating systems by students for students [1].  

One of the "funny" metrics that RMP used was
"hotness", which was represented by chili peppers.
Recently, Rate My Professors decided to eliminate the
hotness rating.  You can read about the change on [_Inside Higher
Ed_](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/07/02/rate-my-professors-ditches-its-chili-pepper-hotness-quotient)
and [_The Chronicle of Higher
Education_](https://www.chronicle.com/article/No-More-Chili-Pepper-/243809).

Before we go any further, let me start by saying that I consider it
inappropriate to rate faculty on how attractive they are.  It has no
relevance to how well they teach [2].  And, as importantly, it encourages
students to objectify their teachers.  Ideally, we should be teaching
our students not to objectify people, whether they be teachers, or peers,
or, well *anyone*.  From that perspective, the elimination of the chili
peppers is a move in the right direction.

Nonetheless, I'm a little sad to see them go.  And no, it's not because
I have so many chili peppers; I think my number is close to zero.  Rather,
it's because of how I've used the chili peppers in talking to students and
because of what they tell us about student ratings of professors.

The Rate My Professors chili peppers play an important role in one of
the dad jokes associated with my [Tigger suit](tigger-suit).  It goes
something like this.

> Sam, aren't you hot in that Tigger suit?

> _Yes, but you'd never tell from the number of chili peppers I get on
  Rate My Professors._

I can probably continue to use the joke for a few more years.  After that,
it won't make sense any more.

But there's a more important reason that I'm sad to see them go.
Because Rate My Professors gathered the data and made them available,
it's possible to show that student ratings of faculty quality correlate
with student ratings of faculty appearance.  That's troublesome.
Would we know that without RMP?  We might; those who study the text
students write on end-of-course evaluations know that students are more
likely to comment on a woman faculty member's appearance than they are
to comment on a man's.  But we wouldn't know as much and we wouldn't
know about within-gender effects.

Is it worth the loss of my joke and the loss of additional data worth
it if they eliminate a way in which students are encouraged to objectify
people?  Definitely.  I can make bad jokes about other issues.  And, well,
we now know yet another way that end-of-course evaluations are biased.

Of course, given the number of ways that EOCEs have been shown to be
biased, it stuns me that institutions treat anything but the coarsest
results from EOCEs as useful in evaluating faculty members.

Bye-bye, chili pepers.  You shan't be missed.

[1] Back when I was at Dartmouth, I'm pretty sure that there was a student
publication that had ratings of all the courses.

[2] I suppose that someone could make facetious arguments like "You're more
likely to pay attention to an attractive teacher" or "You're mmre likely to
be distracted by an attractive teacher".  Such argumens are irrelevant.

Too many opportunities
======================

*Topics/tags: [Overcommitment](index-overcommitment), short*

A few months ago, I saw the announcement for the 2019 Missouri, Iowa,
Nebraska and Kansas Celebration of Women in Computing, also known
as [MINK-WIC](https://www.minkwic.org/) [1].  I did what I normally
do: I checked with Michelle to make sure I could go, set aside the
time, emailed students to encourage them to sign up, and reserved
a van to drive them to the conference.

Since then, a remarkable number of opportunities [2] have come up the
same weekend.  Let's see ... Can I remember them all?  

There's an ACM [3] SIG [4] Governing board meeting that weekend.
As Vice-Chair of SIGCAS, I should attend.  I've also learned a lot
by attending SGB [5] meetings.

There's a small [Graduate Research in CS symposium at the University
of
Iowa](https://cs.uiowa.edu/graduate-programs/2019-prospective-student-visit-day-and-graduate-research-symposium).
That's not something I have to attend, but it's something I'd like
to attend to strengthen contacts with UIowa and to support our
students who would be attending to consider graduate options.

I've just learned that [Grinnell's second multicultural alumni
weekend](https://alumni.grinnell.edu/events/event-registrations/multicultural-alumni-reunion-2019)
is also that weekend.  Before I saw the conflict in dates, I looked
at the schedule and said to myself "that's something I'd really
like to attend".  I'd particularly like to be around to see the
alum who return for the event.

_Why does life provide us with so many conflicting opportunities?_

Since I've already made the commitment to MINK-WIC, I'm planning to
attend MINK-WIC.  

What would I have done if I'd heard about all of
the events at the same time?  If I was unable to find someone else to
take the students to MINK-WIC, I likely would have prioritized that
conference.  If I'd found a substitute, the choice would have been harder.
I probably would have skipped MINK-WIC and the Iowa Symposium.  I'm
not sure how I'd choose between the SGB meeting and the reunion.
Both are important.  I'd learn a lot at both.  I tend to have
imposter syndrome at SGB meetings, and I don't always like to travel,
so there's a chance I'd choose alumni weekend.  But I also feel a
strong sense of responsibility to SIGCAS, so perhaps I'd choose
SGB.  

Maybe it's good that I'd already committed to MINK-WIC.

name reminded them of a social services program.

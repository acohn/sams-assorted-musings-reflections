Syllabus guidelines
===================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), academia, long*

At tomorrow's Faculty Meeting, we are scheduled to vote on some changes
to the _Faculty Handbook_, including some changes to a short section that
deals with course syllabi.  What are the changes?  Let's start with the
current statement, which is taken from Part One: The Academic Organization
of the College, Section IV: Faculty Duties and Responsibilities, Subsection
A: Teaching, Subsubsection 5: Course Syllabi, and reads as follows.


> Each faculty member should prepare a short syllabus for each course the faculty member is teaching. Copies should go to the department chair and to the students enrolled in the course. [1]

What changes are we being requested to approve [3]?  Three of them.  First,
the word "short" is being eliminated.  Second, copies are now going to the
Dean's office, rather than to the department chair.  Third, we are now 
explicitly asked to pay attention to a recent set of syllabus
guidelines that were prepared by the Dean's office.

I have a variety of short notes about syllabi in my musing sketchbook.
None pertain directly to this motion or the guidelines.  If I
recall correctly, most were spurred by articles and discussions in
_Chronicle of Higher Education_ and _Inside Higher Ed_.  But I'm
not moving forward on those notes right now.  Since we're voting
tomorrow, it seems appropriate to reflect a bit on these three
changes and on the associated guidelines.

I do not oppose the removal of the word "short" from the guidelines.
In fact, since I tend to write longer syllabi, to the extent that
I've even handed out a hundred-or-so-page syllabus to my Tutorial
students [4], I strongly support the change.  We haven't been given
the rationale for the removal.  However, given the large number of
syllabus components suggested by the guidelines, I'm not sure that
it's possible to meet those guidelines and to keep the syllabus
short.

What about the second change, which changes who receives our syllabus?
We've been told that the requirement is there because our accreditors [5]
should have ready access to our syllabi.  That makes some sense.
In assessing an institution, you want to be able to see what the classes
are like.  Should we make that purpose clear in the _Handbook_?  I
originally thought not.  However, as I looked around the Interweb,
I saw that some institutions explicitly indicate that accreditation
is the only purpose that the syllabi will be used for.  

How else would an institution use a syllabus?  At some points in
the history of this country, they might have used them to ensure
that faculty were not taking an "inappropriate" stance on material,
such as supporting a socialist agenda [7].  I expect that some
faith-based institutions expect faculty members to follow particular
viewpoints.  I suppose that some institutions might "data mine"
syllabi to find patterns, such as commonly assigned books.  And
some might even use them as the basis of online courses taught by
other faculty.

Should we limit how the institution uses our syllabi?  Part of me
suggests that it's safer to limit these uses.  But the rest of me 
notes that I post my syllabi to the public Web, which means that
they are available for whatever uses the institution would like to
make of them.  

Should I raise the question of syllabus use at the Faculty meeting?
I suppose it will depend on how much of a curmudgeon I am at the 
time.

My biggest concern is with the third change, which adds a reference
to the Dean's office's syllabus guidelines.  The first suggested
revision was particularly concerning.  

> Each faculty member should prepare a syllabus for each course the faculty member is teaching, following the Dean’s guidelines for syllabi. Copies should go to the Dean’s office and to the students enrolled in the course. [9]

Why is that change concerning?  Because it says we have to follow the
Dean's guidelines.  As far as I can tell, that violates faculty members'
academic freedom.  It also gives the Dean's office way too much power
to change what those guidelines say.  At the meeting, I learned that
not all the faculty had even seen the guidelines [12].

Where are the guidelines?  They aren't in [the list of faculty
resources on
GrinCo](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Pages/FacResources.aspx).
They aren't on the Dean's [Support for teaching page on
GrinCo](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Pages/TeachingSupport.aspx).
There is one document entitled "Syllabus Guidelines" at
<https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/AcadProg/Syllabus_Guidelines.pdf>
and another, quite similar looking, document at
<https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/academics/CTLA/SiteAssets/SitePages/Home/Syllabus_Guidelines_2018.pdf>.
SharePoint indicates that the former was viewed 25 times and the
latter was viewed 23 times.  Neither document indicates that it is
what the proposal calls "The Dean's guidelines for syllabi".  And
*nothing* about them is on our public site [15].

It didn't help that one of the Associate Deans described the
guidelines as "best practices".  Given my recent experience with
the use of the term at Grinnell, one should always ask "Best practices
for *who*?" [16].  Changes to our insurance that negatively affect
couples who both work for the College?  A "best practice", but
primarily in terms of controlling costs.  In terms of supporting
and retaining staff, not so much.  Firing the staff member at the
bookstore with the deepest knowledge of books, and doing so without
either (a) consulting with the Instructional Support Committee, who
is supposed to have purview over the bookstore, or (b) reflecting
on the broader purpose of the bookstore on campus?  Again, likely
a "best practice" for cost containment, but not for morale or for
the use of the bookstore as a public academic resource.  And certainly
not a best practice for making sure that long-term employees are
supported and valued.  Building a free-standing desk for an Academic
Support Assistant by a large heater and on a staircase landing that
is likely to be heavily trafficked?  I guess no one described that
as a "best practice".

Whoops.  Didn't mean to go into full-on rant mode.  But I *really* hate
the term "best practices".

To help myself calm down, I'll insert the current proposed language for the
change to the _Handbook_.

> Each faculty member should prepare a syllabus for each course the faculty member is teaching, in compliance with federal regulations with attention to the Dean’s guidelines for best practices. Copies should go to the Dean’s office and to the students enrolled in the course.

That's certainly better.  I appreciate "attention to" rather than "following".
The former suggests that we should pay attention, but does not require us
to follow them exactly.  The latter does.  I'm not sure about the structure
of that first sentence.  I'd like to see an "and" before "with attention".

So, what do the guidelines say about good practices?  They start
with some background.  I appreciate the statement at the end of
that background.

> Several aspects of a well-designed syllabus relate to issues of compliance (accommodations and workload), but this Syllabus Design Guidelines document is not a statement of policy.  [18]

After that, we get a checklist.  The second and third points already
raise some concerns.  Let's see.

> Learning outcomes: Measurable goals are a central feature of a course; consult
departmental and College-wide learning outcomes

> Grading: Graded course elements clearly marked with due dates, weight within the final grade, and connection to learning outcomes; workload appropriate for the credit 

What don't I like about these two points?  For learning outcomes,
I dislike the term "measurable".  While I acknowledge that many
learning outcomes are measurable, as I've noted before, I'm not
sure that many of the most important learning outcomes are measurable,
or at least not quantifiable.  What kinds of outcomes are not measurable?
Well, the College just had us take a faculty survey that, among other
things, asked about our responsibility to help students develop their
spirituality and their moral perspective.  While I don't find myself
responsible for the former, I do consider the latter part of what I
should do as a faculty member [20].  But would I "measure" moral
development?  Almost certainly not.  Here's another.  At the most
recent Science Teaching and Learning Group [21], we discussed how we
help students to "think and act more independently about their learning".
Can we really measure how well students have "learned how to learn"?
I suppose we might develop a complicated instrument, or we could just ask
students.  But I'm not sure that such measurement is necessary.  

So, while "measurable outcomes" may be a best practice for, say,
bean counters, it may not be as good a practice for students and
teachers interested in less tangible, but more important, outcomes.
I might even go so far as to say that the measurable outcomes of
my courses are the ones students are most likely to forget.  Think
back to your college days.  Are the things that faculty measured most
important to you, or are things like study habits, a passion for a
subject, or a new way of looking at the world more important?

What about that third bullet point?  I certainly agree that a
syllabus should list all the work expected of students and the due
dates for that work.  When I teach Tutorial, I rely on that information
to help my students plan their semesters and to look ahead for
trouble spots.  But "connection to learning outcomes"?  Is that
necessary?  Is it even good?  What is the connection of an exam or
quiz to a learning outcome?  Aren't such devices more intended as
a way to assess outcomes?  And isn't figuring out the connection of
other work in a class to learning outcomes a skill students should
develop?  I know that I regularly ask my students to take a moment
to reflect on why I've asked them to do something.  Won't they learn
more from that reflection than from me telling them?

I suppose I shouldn't be so critical.  Most of the guidelines are
good.  I particularly appreciate statements about accessibility,
techniques for inclusivity, and the suggestion that we should
"[c]learly communicate high expectations for student success and
project confidence that students can meet your expectations through
hard work. "

Nonetheless, when you start with "measurable outcomes" as a primary
goal of the syllabus, I want to make sure that you're not going to
force me to follow an educational philosophy that is much different
than my own.

I wonder how Monday's discussion will go.  Fortunately, I expect that
most of the emphasis will be on _Handbook_ changes, rather than the
particulars of the guidelines.  And, even though I hate the term
"best practices", I likely won't object to it.

Postscript: One more snarky comment: If these guidelines were last
updated before Dean Harris was hired, let alone before she started,
how are they "the Dean's guidelines for best practices"?  In fact,
given that she's spoken about the value of transformative knowledge
that is difficult to measure [22], I'd love to see the guidelines that
she would write, rather than the guidelines we currently have.

---

Postscript: I very much appreciate the hard work that went into our
syllabus document.  And I know that some people I respect greatly
have a very different philosophy on course outcomes than I do.  I
should be clear that I have no objections to the document itself.
Rather, my concern is that the proposed language would have imposed
it on us.

not rely on the continued availability of web.grinnell.edu.  I wonder
what happens to all the documents there if it goes away.

to change this part of the _Handbook_, I've been forced to use the
passive voice.

the semester because I thought it would be useful for the students to see them

[6] No, not the NCAA.  That's a completely separate organization.

[7] Just in case it isn't clear, I do not consider it inappropriate [8].

[8] I am not quite comfortable with the double negative in this
sentence.  However, I could not find a better way to phrase it.
"I consider it appropriate" is not the same as "I do not consider
it inappropriate".  It's not worth my time to find a better way to
phrase the concept.

[12] It should not surprise my readers that I read the early drafts
of these guidelines when they were first released and raised some
concerns [14].

[14] Nope, not telling.

[15] I apologize for acting like a broken record about this issue.
However, I think we owe it to the broader community to share documents
like the guidelines with the broader community.

[16] Or is that "Best practices for whom?"  I think not.

Getting the recipient right
===========================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), email, short*

Today I received a message that was something like the following.

    From: "Some Person via DocuSign" <dse@eumail.docusign.net>  
    Date: August 16, 2018 at 5:01:25 AM CDT  
    Subject: Please DocuSign: Chapter Accommodation Licence  
    Reply-To: Some Person <some.person@site.com>

I did not know what a "Chapter Accommodation License" was.  I did not know
of any contracts that I needed to sign.  And it was from another country.
I assume my inclination was the same as yours: "It's a phishing message."
This kind of message is a typical approach to phishing.  "Thank you for
your order.  Please sign the contract."  My normal inclination is to trash
such messages [1].

But something in the back of my head told me to review the message.
And it's good that I did.  It turns out that while the message was not
intended for me, it was intended for a member of my family.  That's a
problem.  I understand the occasional misdirected email message.
But people who need signatures should spend extra care in getting
it right.  We've also had a similar problem before and the issue was
supposed to have been resolved.  In April.  I'm unhappy, to say the least.

Now I'm just crossing my fingers that I didn't delete any other important
electronic mail messages that were intended for another member of
my family.

[1] That's not quite true.  My normal inclination is to forward them to
our security team so that they can be on the lookout for similar messages.

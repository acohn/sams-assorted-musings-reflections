Easing the burden (part of a draft letter to the incoming chair)
================================================================

_We are nearing the end of [my set of musings that serve as a draft letter
to the incoming chair of the department](index-incoming-chair).  I've
listed a lot of things.  It's probably time to think about how to make
the job a bit less burdensome._

---

As you've probably noted [1] I have some issues with control, boundaries,
delegation, and saying no.  My experience suggests that if I'm not a bit
of a control freak, things do not get done to the level that I'd like.
I should also admit that when I try to take control over everything,
not everything gets done, either.

I spend some time being proactive.  I am perhaps too proactive.  I try to
arrange alternatives for when things don't work out.  These alternatives
are not always needed.  As an Engineer, you realize that there are
trade-offs between cost (to you) and reliability.  I agree with your
aphorism that "hours of planning can save days of corrections", but it's
probably worth figuring out when planning is and is not necessary.

Delegate!  Students can do a lot.  You can get money for them from Ang.
We share.

Michelle says that you should not delegate to much to me and, if you
try, I should say no.  Try not to delegate too much too our early-career
faculty.  They should be working on their teaching and scholarship so
that they can earn tenure.

Warning: Sometimes delegation doesn't work the way it's supposed to.
I tried to delegate the Linux SysAdmin search.  I still spent way too 
much time before they finally started using my delegates.  Some delegates
on campus don't do what they are delegated to do, or don't do so in
a timely fashion.  Work on clarity.  Set followups in your time management
program.

Eliminate!

On being a workaholic
=====================

The other day, Michelle mentioned that she found an interesting cruise
to do this summer.  "But it's the same week that you're doing the AP
reading [1]," she said, "and I know you'd rather be at the reading."
The sad thing is that she's right.

So, why is it that?  I'll use this musing to think about it.

Spending time with family is wonderful.  I love sitting with Michelle and
the kids and playing games, or arguing about something, or even watching 
TV.  And, when possible, I prioritize that above all [2].

But I really enjoy being in environments in which I can take advantage
of my particular skill set [3].  It's nice to know that I'm useful in
the world.  I also like environments in which I build that skill set
and in which I learn new things.  So, although the AP reading may feel
like a week of grading [7] and the worst kind of grading [8], it's also
an opportunity to learn about how others think about CS, to meet new
people who care deeply about CS education, and perhaps even to shape
some national conversations [9].

When I'm in Kansas city, I get to visit the [Kemper Museum of
Contermporary Art](https://www.kemperart.org/), which always has a few
pieces that I want to sit and study for longer periods of time.  The
last time I went, I also found myself making plans for my next large-scale
art project [10].

But what about cruises?  Let's see.  They have a lot of eating and
drinking.  I certainly enjoy eating and drinking, but eating is something
I am currently trying to cut back on.  Cruises encourage socializing.
I'm an introvert; I don't like making casual conversation with new people
[11].  The cruise Michelle is planning on involves a lot of interesting
stops.  I like visiting new places.  But I also don't like being a
prototypical "ugly American".  I'm very large.  I don't have a good
sense of the space I take around me [12].  So, whether or not people judge
me, I feel like I should be judged.  Some cruises have shows.  I love
live music.  But I find cruise shows to be "canned entertainment" and,
well, that's not so entertaining [14].

If I look at the two opportunities, it strikes me that whether I go on the
cruise or go to the AP reading, I'll come back exhausted.  The AP reading
will exhaust me from too much work.  The cruise will exhaust me from too
much interaction with people and too much anxiety about how others view me.
I'd prefer the positive kind of exhaustion.

But I should admit that other aspects of my personality get in the way.
When I have down time, I'm always thinking about other things that I can
do ... start another project, improve some teaching materials, write
up work I've done in the past, catch up on grading [15], etc., etc.
If my "vacation" emphasizes work, I'm not thinking about what else I
could be doing.  If my vaction is just down time, I'm worrying about
the other work [16].

So, how do I take a more successful vacation with my wife or my family?
I should look toward vacations that don't require broad socialization,
that give us time to talk and to play games, that potentially give me a
bit of time each day to work [18], that provide access to the arts or
nature, and in which I don't worry as much about my self image.  If I
think about the vacations that worked best for me, they've included going
to Scout camp as a family [19], our family road trip [20], our family
trip to Cancun [21], and even some things we've called "staycations".
Maybe something more like one of those would work.  Or maybe a music
cruise or train ride.  But is that what my family would like?  We should
talk and find an appropriate compromise.

Postscript: This musing, like many, reflects the privilege of my position
in life.  I have a skill set that allows me to be invited to interesting
places and get paid to work [22].  And I am fortunate that my skill set 
also provides me with the income in which I can consider a variety of
vacations.

[1] More precisely, the second full-scale reading for the new AP CS
Principles examination.

[2] I say "when possible" because there are real work things that
interfere: Making sure that exams are graded for CSC 151, finishing a
required administrative document or the review of a scholarly paper,
meeting some other deadline.

[3] I think of my skill set as that I know a lot about computer science,
I know a lot about computer science education, I can think well on my feet
(as it were), I have a strong work ethic [4], I have a broader worlview
that is not limited to CS [5], and I'm rarely intimidated by people
in authority.  I have other strengths, too.  Some group of folks find
that I help empower them, that I'm kind, and that I can collaborate [6].

[4] Since I make fun of students for choosing "I have a strong work ethic"
in response to some interview questions, I probably shouldn't say it about
myself.  But it's true.

[5] For example, I think carefully and care deeply about issues of writing
and the arts.

[6] Stop laughing.  There are many circumstances in which I collaborate well.

[7] Previously identified as one of the things I like least about my job.

[8] The best kind of grading is the kind of grading that helps students
learn.  Grading that is intended only to assess, and in which students have
no real potential to reflect and respond, seems less useful.

[9] I plan to continue to push strongly for very clear guidelines on 
citation on the CSP exam and on enforcement of those guidelines.

[10] I'm not sure when I'll have time for that project or what I'll do
with the project when I'm done.  But I enjoy the creative planning.

[11] I don't mind socializing in professional situations; if the conversation
is about, say, CS and CS education, I'm fine.  But social situations sap
energy.

[12] I know I'm large.  But my self image is still smaller than my physical
body, so I do run into people without realizing it.

[14] I would not object to one of the cruises that involves a band that
I like, such as one with Jason and the Scorchers or Dan Navarro.  That
kind of performance feels very different.

[15] Only during the school year.

[16] Okay, I'm also worrying about other work when I'm on a "workation"
[17].  But I worry more on a traditional vacation.

[17] Hmmm ... is that a useful new term?

[18] Or pretend to work.

[19] Being in the middle of the woods is a great way to avoid socialization.

[20] Most of the time was together as a family and not with other people.

[21] In spite of crappy weather, one bad day of resort salescritters,
and getting caught in quicksand.

[22] Or at least to get invited to interesting places to work and have
my expenses covered.

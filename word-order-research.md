Word order matters
==================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), language, short*

Two or so years ago, the Grinnell faculty voted that every student should
have the opportunity to do research.  More recently, I've heard both our
Dean and some fellow faculty say that every student should have a research
opportunity.

Word order matters.

"Every student has *the opportunity to do research*" suggests that
we will offer up that opportunity, but not every student necessarily
has to avail themselves of that offer.  "Every student has "a research
opportunity*" suggests that every student engages in research.

As I recall the discussion, some faculty members suggested that not
every student would want to do research.  A few may have even suggested
that not all students will be ready to do research.  So I'm pretty sure
that our resolution was the first of the two statements.  Let's me see.
It appears that we approved the motion at our meeting of April 4, 2016
and that motion read as follows:

> Student research is focused inquiry supervised by a faculty member
that seeks to answer or explore an intellectual and/or creative
problem or question.  Grinnell College seeks to provide every student
an opportunity to pursue research and share the product publicly.

I see that my description is wrong, too.  I say "the opportunity to do
research".  It's really "*an* opportunity to *pursue* research."

So let's get the words and the word order right!

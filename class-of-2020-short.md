A few days ago, Grinnell made the sensible decision to send most
students home for the rest of the semester and to hold classes
online [1].  One major impact of this decision is that the Grinnell
College class of 2020 is unlikely to have a normal graduation.

Yesterday, I received a note asking for a short tribute recording
to the class, which they expected to play at a gathering to celebrate
the class of 2020 [2].  Rather than ad lib the tribute, I decided
to write down what I expected to say.  And what better place than
in a musing?  I'll almost certainly write longer tributes, both to
the class of 2020 and to the CS class of 2020.  But those will come
at the normal graduation time, in the middle of May.

For now, here are a few sentences.

> Dear Grinnell class of 2020.  You are among the most special
Grinnell classes to me for a whole host of reasons none of which
I will list.  During the not-quite-four years that you have been
here, I have found you thoughtful, wise, frustrating, inquistive,
friendly, infuriating, amazing, insightful, challenging, smart
(incredibly smart), frustrating [3], supportive, similar and
different, engaged and engaging, independent and interdependent,
and oh so much more.  That is to say, you have been and will continue
to be Grinnellians.  **Thank you!**  [Please insert a joke
or trite saying about how the class of 2020 sees clearly.] Good
luck in these strange last few weeks of the semester and please
stay in touch.

Not perfect.  I hope it will do.  It's a bit cheesy, but it's much
less cheesy than the two examples we were given.  And I think it
reflects who I am [4] and how I think about the class.  Ralph would
probably suggest that I explore the rhythm a bit more, but I don't
feel up to that task.

**_Postscript_**: Finding good places to record in a hotel is hard.
There's a bit of background noise in my video.  _C'est la vie_.
At least there's this script/transcript.  And written trumps spoken,
right?

**_Postscript_**: As we think about alternatives to graduation, it strikes
me that a JibJab-style animation, where you can fill in your face, could be
a useful bit of levity.  I wonder if one of our majors, such as PK, might
put something together.

[1] I'll write more about these issues in separate posts.

[2] As I started this musing, I received a note that the in-person event
was canceled for safety reasons.  I expect these tributes will end up
residing on a server somewhere and will be distributed to students
remotely.

[3] Yeah, it's worth mentioning twice.

[4] That is, my jokes are as moldy as bleu cheese.

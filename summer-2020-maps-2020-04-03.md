Today is April 3.  In one week, on April 10, the College will be
making decisions about Summer MAPs (Mentored Advanced Projects).
Not the normal decisions, such as who gets MAP funding, but the big
picture decision of whether or not we offer Summer MAPs and, if so,
how.

Summer MAPs and MIPs are incredibly important experiences for
students.  Almost every student I have supervised in a Summer MAP
or MIP, and there have been a lot of them, has reported growing
significantly from the experience of being able to work on a project
full-time (forty or more hours per week) for ten weeks.  During
that intensive an experience, students get the opportunity to claim
ownership of a project (or part of a project), to collaborate with
others in building the project, to fail and learn from that failure,
to explore the literature related to the project, and, we hope, to
develop something that contributes to that literature.  It's a
transformational experience.

Now, I won't claim that it's just the research that transforms
students.  I have a lot of students who grow from the associated
co-curricular experiences, such as being responsible for cooking
for themselves, having the time to do group meals with others,
socializing at game night, playing Ultimate or other games outside,
exploring Iowa City and Des Moines and other parts of Iowa, even
taking team trips elsewhere.  But the research is core to the
experience.

The associated aspects of MAPs also make a difference to students,
particularly the ability to present their work to others.  My
students have found particular value in presentations at research
conferences (I appreciate the comments I receive that they are as poised
and prepared as grad students) and, at times, at undergraduate
research conferences, such as the Midstates Symposia [1].

How important are summer MAPs and MIPs?  I often say that some of
the most valuable teaching I do is in summer MAPs and MIPs.  It's
when I say students discover just how much they can do.  I've done
summer MAPs and MIPs for no compensation and often take on extra 
students because I find them so valuable.

Summer MAPs and MIPs can also play an important role in faculty
research.  I will say I've had mixed experiences.  There are some
projects, like the Code Camps, that I could not have completed
without my research students.  There have also been some summers
in which I would have moved my projects further forward if I had
spent the same amount of time on research that I spent teaching and
supervising my research students.  But it's worth my time in either
case.

All of that leads into what I think about and what I hope for this
coming summer.  

I've seen the curves.  The first peak is in late April, at the
earliest.  There's almost no way that we'll be able to let students
back on campus this summer [2].  But that doesn't mean that we
should cancel summer MAPs.  While remote MAPs are a different
creature than in-person MAPs, they can still provide many of the
benefits to students, particularly the experience of working full
time on a research project over which they have some ownership.

In my discipline, computer science, remote work is common.  I've
spoken with many alumni who work in different cities (perhaps even
different continents) than their collaborators.  There are a host
of tools that support such remote collaboration, whether synchronous
or asynchronous.  Many of my professional societies, such as the
National Center for Women in Information Technology, are encouraging
those who support summer opportunities to convert those to
remote/virtual opportunities when possible.

Grinnell even has some implicit and explicit support for remote MAPs.
Certainly, our efforts at running asynchronous remote classes suggest
that we believe that there can be benefits from remote learning.
We also have [official policies and guidelines for remote
MAPs](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/dean/map/distance) which,
admittedly, were designed for when students or faculty needed to
do site-specific work.  But that doesn't mean we can't adapt them
to the situation at hand.

What happens if we cancel summer MAPs and MIPs?  Some of the students
signed up for summer MAPs and MIPs may be able to do MAPs or MIPs
during the academic year.  But part-time research is a very different
experience than full-time research.  And not all faculty will be
able to support academic-year MAPs and MIPs.  I know that I won't
[3].  The College also puts much stricter limits on the number of
MAPs one can supervise during the semester.

What about pushing this summer's research students to next summer?
Rising seniors won't be able to do MAPs next summer.  And there may
not be slots for both this year's rising second-year and third-year
students and next year's.  In CS, I think we were only able to offer
positions to fewer than half of the students who applied; having
to push this summer's students to next summer would make the odds
even lower.  Grinnell has said that these kinds of research
opportunities are core to our program [5].  We have some obligation
to do our best offer such opportunities, provided they don't put
an inappropriate burden on students, faculty, staff, or the institution
as a whole.

I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we'll permit remote MAPs and MIPs
this summer.  I'm also writing to the Dean about it.  I hope you will, too.

**_Postscript_**: A few departments, such as Chemistry, require a
significant research experience as part of the curriculum.  Most
students achieve those goals with MAPs.  Some students achieve those
goals with REUs, but I expect those will not be available this
summer.  I'm not sure you can do a remote Chemistry MAP.  I wonder
how my colleagues (and the College) plan to address these complex issues.

[1] Often, they are the only CS students presenting, so their audience
may find the work of less interest.

[2] I think that means that we also shouldn't force the students currently
on campus to leave.

[3] I'll be serving as Department Chair, teaching Tutorial, and
developing at least one new course [4].

[4] HCI, which is new to me and has not been taught since Janet left.

[5] I recall the Dean's office consuming dozens of hours of my time
documenting research opportunities the last time I was chair.

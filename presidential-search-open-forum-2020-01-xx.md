Meeting
for all faculty to talk to the search chair and the search firm on
Monday at 4pm, the normal time for Faculty meetings.  Less than a
dozen faculty showed up [Should that be "fewer than a dozen"?],
none of whom were early-career faculty.  [I think only one had been
there for less time than I.]  How was it advertised?  It was in the
Campus memo of January 21, but that was titled "Campus Memo 1/14/2020",
so folks may have missed it.  There was a "Reminder" sent to the
faculty at 10:00 a.m. on Monday.  However, a reminder doesn't make
much sense if there isn't clear advance notice.  Frustrations with
some of the data the consultants gave: 50% acceptance rate when we
were hiring Raynard [I checked, and while there was a year or so
that we had a 50% acceptrance rate, that had more to do with a
transition in admissions; our acceptance rate was significantly
lower in prior years], the irritating claim that our graduation
rates are 10% lower than those of our peers.  They also said that black
students had graduation rates much lower than other students, which
contradicted what I thought I had heard.  Fortunately, my office is
upstairs from AIR and I could ask.  They were correct; the gap between
the graduation rates is embarrassing; it's over 10% in most recent
years.

At yesterday's open forum, it was mentioned that we could submit
comments to the Presidential Search Committee and to Isaacson-Miller
online.  I looked on the Presidential Search Page at Grinnell [1]
and did not see a link for submitting comments.  There was a link
to a page at Isaacson-Miller [2], but that page seems for applying
or nominating, rather than submitting comments.  (There's a place
to ask questions, but those seem to be questions from candidates.)
So I sent a question about that.  What did I discover?

Where do we go to submit comments and suggestions for the search ad?

Thanks!

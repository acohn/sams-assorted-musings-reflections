Fisking
=======

*Topics/tags: [Language](index-language), short*

In their comments on [my recent musing about the term "double-blind
grading"](double-blind-grading-2019-11-22), someone pointed me to
[a fisking by the professor who was being asked to employ this
technique](http://www.rasmusen.org/special/2019kerfuffle/provost1.htm).

I had not heard the term "fisking" before, so I did what any sensible
person does.  I pulled down my _Oxford English Dictionary) from the
shelf and looked it up.

No, wait.  That's not right.  I did a Web search.  My _OED_ is in my
lab, and I was working at home [1].

For those who are as uninformed
as I am, I found [the following definition](https://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2004/05/05/what-is-fisking) on _ScienceBlogs_.

> **fisking**: n.

> [blogosphere; very common] A point-by-point refutation of a blog entry or (especially) news story. A really stylish fisking is witty, logical, sarcastic and ruthlessly factual; flaming or handwaving is considered poor form. Named after Robert Fisk, a British journalist who was a frequent (and deserving) early target of such treatment.

That definition is supposedly taken from
<http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/F/fisking.html>, which no longer
seems to exist.

Postscript: I found that my spell checker [2] did not know the term
"fisking", but Grammarly did.  On the other hand, Grammarly doesn't
seem to know the name of my spell checker.

[1] I likely would have done a Web search in any case.  I wonder if
Grinnell has a license to the online _OED_.

[2] `aspell`.

Fisking
=======

*Topics/tags: [Language](index-language), short*

In their comments on [my recent musing about the term "double-blind
grading"](double-blind-grading-2019-11-22), someone pointed me to
[a fisking by the professor who was being asked to employ this
technique](http://www.rasmusen.org/special/2019kerfuffle/provost1.htm).

I had not heard the term "fisking" before, so I did what any sensible
person does.  I pulled down my _Oxford English Dictionary) from the
shelf and looked it up.

No, wait.  That's not right.  I did a Web search.  My _OED_ is in my
lab, and I was working at home [1].

For those who are as uninformed
as I am, I found [the following definition](https://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2004/05/05/what-is-fisking) on _ScienceBlogs_.

> **fisking**: n.

> [blogosphere; very common] A point-by-point refutation of a blog entry or (especially) news story. A really stylish fisking is witty, logical, sarcastic and ruthlessly factual; flaming or handwaving is considered poor form. Named after Robert Fisk, a British journalist who was a frequent (and deserving) early target of such treatment.

That definition is supposedly taken from
<http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/F/fisking.html>.  However, that page
no longer seems to exist [2].  But we might as well credit it.

I'll admit that I found it more fun to look at [the Wikipedia talk
page on fisking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AFisking).  I
don't read enough Wikipedia talk pages.  If they're all this
interesting, I definitely should.

In any case, I look forward to finding that deserves a fisking and
then writing that fisking.  Maybe I'll even write a fisking [3]
about one of my own musings or rants.

Postscript: I found that my spell checker [4] did not know the term
"fisking", but Grammarly did.  On the other hand, Grammarly doesn't
seem to know the name of my spell checker [5].

[1] I likely would have done a Web search in any case.  I wonder if
Grinnell has a license to the online _OED_.

[2] Or maybe it's just blank now.

[3] I would much prefer to write "fisk" than "write a fisking".  But
it doesn't seem to be a verb.

[4] `aspell`.

[5] It appears that `aspell` also doesn't know about `aspell`.  
Fascinating.

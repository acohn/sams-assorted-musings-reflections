Unproductive
============

*Topics/tags: [Workload](index-overcommitment), short*

I started this weekend with a long to-do list [1].  I had grading to do.
I had assignments to write.  I had paperwork to complete.  I had household
responsibilities.  I had email to reply to.  And more.

Friday night I watched high-school tennis until a little after 7 p.m. [2].
Then, I made [less than thoughtful decisions](sleepless-cycles) and
ended up staying up late musing [3].

Saturday somehow got consumed by cooking, three artistic events [5],
and a social event.  But I got to bed by about 10 p.m.

Sunday, the family did brunch in Des Moines.  We returned home at about
3 p.m. and I was tired enough that I took what I thought would be a short
nap.  I got interrupted by a phone call from a reporter [6], but still
ended up sleeping until after 6pm.  I thought I could get work done then.
But, well, things got in the way.

It is now 8:30 p.m. on Sunday night.  I've done no productive work all
weekend, other than responding to a few emails throughout the weekend
and drafting a few musings that I was unable to finish [7].  It feels like
my to-do list continues to grow.

But I won't be productive if I'm exhausted.  So I'm keeping this musing
short, working until 9:30 p.m., and going to bed.

I wonder when I'll find time to get the rest of my work done.

[1] Yes, DC, I'm using Todoist to manage that to-do list.  I'll muse
about it at some point.

[2] If a sentence ends with the time "7 p.m.", should I have just the
one period after "m" or two?  I'd venture to guess that it's two.  My
_Chicago Manual of Style_ is in the office.  Perhaps the best bet is
to rewrite the sentence.

[3] I was going to say that I stayed up late "playing on the InterWeb".
Then I remembered that Friday night was my night to explore the
preregistration data.  I think that's what kept me up late, but I
can't recall [4].

[4] Yes, I realize that lack of memory is a symptom of both advancing
years and decreasing sleep.

[5] Grinnell symphony, a vocal recital, and the evening Dance/Jazz band
performance.

[6] More on that in another musing.

[7] Amazingly, coherent musings are hard when I'm tired.

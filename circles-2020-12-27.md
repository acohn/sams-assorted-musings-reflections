A few years ago, Chinyere Ukabiala, Grinnell's ombuds, was exploring
other modes of handling conflicts and resolving offenses.  She suggested
that the campus consider restorative justice practices.  One that seemed
particularly appropriate to the Grinnell community was the restorative
justice circle.  We've since had experts visit campus to discuss these
approaches and to train people to lead circles.  Chinyere also took a
sabbatical to explore these issues in more depth, a sabbatical that
unfortunately got cut short because of the pandemic.

This fall, the Office of the Ombuds office has sponsored a variety
of circles intended not so much for restorative justice as for
community building.  In a typical session, we get broken up into
small groups with a designated leader and then talk through a variety
of questions relevant to the state of the College and the state of
the world.

I will admit that I was puzzled at first: I think of the circles
first as a way to address conflict and offenses and had not realized
that Chinyere was considering other uses.  But I know I learn things
when I go to campus events, and I respect Chinyere highly, so I
went.  While I was put off by the lack of transcription, I appreciated
the event.  And I learned that circles can be used for a variety of
purposes, including community building.

How do these circles build community?  First of all, people from a
variety of backgrounds and situations on campus are encouraged to 
participate: There are administrators, faculty, staff, students, and
even the occasional alum.  The circles give us a chance to hear about
each others' experiences, concerns, and successes.  I'd tell you more
about the particulars, but circles are confidential.

The circles take time: About sixty minutes for the circle itself along
with another twenty minutes for preparation and ten minutes of debriefing.
But it's time that I find worthwhile.  I've met new people, heard
some common concerns, and discovered other perspectives on a variety
of issues.  I feel more connected to campus after each session, and
I've broadened my understanding.

Mostly the same people show up each time, with a few changes.  There
seem to be comparatively few students and faculty (relative to
staff), and comparatively few people who identify as male, or who
I identify as male.  That's not to say that there aren't a wide
variety of experiences; the staff also come from many locations on
campus (and off campus, since folks from the Old Glove Factory
participate, too) [1], and even ignoring that, people of the same
gender and similar position may still have very different experiences
and opinions.

I wish more members of the Grinnell would participate.  Community
circles provide an important mechanism for building community on
campus and to help us better understand others or at least some of
the experiences of others.  There are benefits to individuals and to
the campus as a whole.

I'll need to consider ways to encourage others to participate or to
consider participating.  I hope that the College will help ensure that
staff can attend my treating the circles as one of those things that
are automatically accepted as paid time away from your job [2].  As
I said, I think greater participation will benefit both participants
and the College.

I'd also like to see some focused circles; for example, I can see some
benefit to a restorative circle with ITS and CS.  I believe we respect
each other, but I know that CS feels injured by ITS and I expect that
ITS has had negative experiences with CS.  Maybe I'll check in with
DaveR about it.

What should you take from all this?  If you don't participate in
circles, I hope you consider attending one.  If you supervise others,
I hope you'll support them in attending one.  If you coordinate
circles, I hope you'll remember time restrictions on campus; community
time is officially 11:30-1:00 on Thursday. 

Oh, I suppose you've also realized that I'm out of practice musing,
and my muse is out of practice inspiring me.  Don't worry; it should
get better.

[1] To be honest, most people seem to be participating from home,
so most people are off campus.  Perhaps I should have said "from
different offices".

[2] If I were a better person, I'd know the formal term.

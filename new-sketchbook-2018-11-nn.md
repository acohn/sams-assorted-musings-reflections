Starting a new "sketchbook"
===========================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta).*

As I mention at [the end of most months](index-monthly), I keep an
electronic "sketchbook" of potential musing topics and notes on those
topics.  The sketchbook really has multiple parts; there's a single file
that contains the list and some notes on many topics, but there are also
a variety of partial musings.  I find the sketchbook useful when my muse
has trouble suggesting a topic.  I also like being able to jot down an
idea and therefore to get it out of my head.

A strength and weakness of the sketchbook is that it grows [1].  That is,
even though I cross out [2] entries when I write the corresponding musing,
the number of potential musings seems to grow and grow and grow.  When I
started this musing on 2 November 2018, I had 155 topics for musings
in the "categorized" section of the sketchbook and another 358 in the
other sections, too many of which have labels like "high priority".
It's sometimes depressing to read through the list.  I keep saying
something like, "I really want to write about that [3], but there are
too many things that have a higher priority."

When things grow that much, it's eventually time to prune them.  So I've
made a copy of the sketchbook, thrown out everything that's not in the
"categorized" section, and pruned that section a bit, too.  Now I'm
left with 141 in the main section and 69 in the list of Grinnellians to
write about [4].

I have mixed feelings about the culling.  On the one hand, I'm glad that
I could remove a lot of topics from consideration, or at least consideration
in the near future.  On the other hand, now that I've read through the
list again, I find myself yearning to write about most of the topics I've 
kept in the sketchbook, as well as the half-dozen or so that I ended up
adding as I went through that list.

There are three kinds of entries in the main sections of the sketchbook.
I have about 44 entries in which I've added anywhere from a few sentences
to a full a paragraph of notes in the midst of the list of topics.  I have
50 entries in which I've already created a separate file for the musing.
The remaining entries?  Some are just a topic whose name is supposed
to be clear enough that I'll figure out the rest (e.g., "The moat").
Some have an accompanying link to an article that I expect to serve as
the source of a musing (e.g., for "Creating a syllabus", I have a link
to <https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/advice-syllabus>).

Which kind of entry do I prefer once I've chosen a topic?  I like to
have a bit to start with when I write, even a few notes as to what I
was thinking about when I added the topic.  I thought I'd been better
about adding those notes of late, but those data suggest otherwise.

More importantly, which does my muse prefer?  I don't want to speak for
her, other than in terms of what she seems to be asking to think about
as I write this paragraph [5].  The short entries make it easier to scan
the list.  And that holds whether the short entries are plain topics,
topics with links to articles, or topics with a reference to a separate
sketch or draft.  On the other hand, the longer entries provide more of
an opportunity to catch her eye or mine.  It's a tradeoff with no clear
winner.  For the time being, I'll continue to use whatever form seems
most appropriate.

What about the tags and categories that I've been including with each
entry in the sketchbook?  I had planned to use them to help my muse.
If she suggested that I write about the joy of code, for example,
those tags could allow us to quickly skim the list of possible topics.
Or, more realistically, on days in which I did not have a lot of time
to write, those tags could lead us to short musings, to musings with
substantive drafts, or to musings which exhibit both characteristics [6].
We haven't generally used them that way.  However, when we skim through
the list of the first dozen or so possible topics, they do prove to be
of use, particularly on those days in which I don't have a lot of
time to muse.

Even though we're not necessarily using the tags in the way I expected,
I plan to continue to use them.  And I paid a bit more attention to them
in reorganizing the the sketchbook.  I decided to reformat them a bit
to help set them apart in the formatted version of the sketchbook.  I
rarely use that version of the sketchbook.  However, I realized that 
making the tags easy to find visually might also be helpful [8].  I
also made a few other visual changes.  I have no idea whether any will
be useful.

With so many outstanding musings, I'm wondering whether it might make sense
to muse more than once daily.  I guess that will depend on how my other
writing goes.  We shall see.

[1] And grows.  And grows.

[2] Remove.

[3] Or, in many cases, finish writing about that.

[4] I remain eternally optimistic that I'll be able to spend time on
that series.  Maybe that will be a sabbatical project.

[5] She did suggest writing about the different kinds of entries, so
it's clear something she considers worthwhile.  Or perhaps she just
wanted me to gather some more relatively pointless data.

[6] Short musings with substantive drafts are both a blessing and a curse,
to use yet another too-common colloquialism [7].  On the one hand, they
show a potential for quick completion.  On the other, because they are
short, I sometimes take them as an invitation to tune the language carefully
or find myself frustrated that I'm not taking that time.

[7] Youngest Son had a better term for them recently, but I can't
remember what it was.

[8] I still think `grep` is likely to be more helpful.

Ranking criteria

Grinnell is in the midst of a search for a new tenure-line faculty member
in the CS department, our seventh full-time person.  One of the issues
that comes up when you hire new faculty is the set of criteria you use
in selecting candidates.  We all have criteria in the back of our heads -
_Will this person teach well? Do they care about diversity? Will their
scholarship meet Grinnell's broader expectations?_  In my early days of
hiring at Grinnell, those criteria came up implicitly in discussions
of candidates.

A few years ago, the College decided that we should make those criteria
explicit, rather than implicit.  That was a great idea.  The conversations
about criteria are useful and help us come up with a broader departmental
consensus as to what we value.  This year, our chair put the criteria into
four categories: teaching, scholarship, other, and bridging (things that
bridge two or more categories).  However, I tend to think of them in terms
of three categories: teaching, scholarship, and "fit".  I realize that
last criterion seems a bit iffy, but in that category, I include things
like commitment to supporting diversity, writing ability [1,2]

[1] Our official department criterion is "fluent, accurate, and
well-organized communication".

[2] There are many reasons to care about writing, not least that every
Grinnell faculty member teaches Tutorial.

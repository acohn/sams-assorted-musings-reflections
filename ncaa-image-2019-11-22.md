Licensing athlete's images
==========================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia), short*

One of the important recent changes in the morass that we call
college athletics is the decision by the NCAA to allow athletes to
profit off of their image and identity [1].  I'm not sure that it's the
right approach to the complex issues at play, but I also don't think
it's fair that others profit off of a college athlete's identity,
such as by selling shirts with their name or by using that identity
in video games.  Perhaps it's a step.  But we need to acknowledge that
there are lots of different situations at play.  For example, it strikes
me that if a D3 football team has a player who cannot afford cleats, it
should be able to provide that player with cleats [2].

Recently, [_The Chronicle of Higher Education_](https://www.chronicle.com/)
included [an article about the potential impact of this change on
athletes other than those in the big-money
sports](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Image-Licensing-Deals-Could/247591).
What surprised me about that article, and many like it, is that it
did not seem to raise the priamry concern many have about this
change, and it's a concern that may even be applicable to these
athletes.

Let's suppose that N. Bewster [3] is entralled with volleyball at
Grinnell.  Bewster knows that for that team to go to the next level,
we need another great outside hitter [4].  Let's also suppose that
high-school senior Killin K. [5] would be an outstanding recruit
for the team and that she [6] has the academic credentials to be
successful at Grinnell.  As a D3 institution [7], Grinnell can't
give Killin an athletic scholarship.  So how do we convince her to
come?  Well, Bewster could offer her a contract to use her image,
say for $100,000 per year, using the rationale that he expects to
boost his business with t-shirts and mugs that say "Killin K. eats
Bewster's Bagels", or some such.

It's pretty clear to me that this kind of situation will happen
regularly for top football and basketball recruits at D1 institutions.
Certainly, similar "under the table" arrangements regularly come
to light.  I wonder whether it will also affect other sports.

and current volleyball players, is completely coincidental.

[1] As you might expect, the NCAA did not make this decision on their
own.  Rather, legistlative changes in California and planned legislative
changes in other states effectively forced this decision.

[2] My understanding of the current NCAA rules is that this is not
permissible.

[3] Pronounced "booster".

[4] I have no idea whether or not we need another good outside hitter.
I'm pretty sure that we have at least two great ones.  Please go
along with the narrative anyay.

[5] So named because of the number of kills her parents knew she would
make.

[6] We also assume that Killin self-identifies as female.

[7] Or because our volleyball team is a D3 team.

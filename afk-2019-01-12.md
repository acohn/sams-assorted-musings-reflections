AFK
===

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

I did not post a musing yesterday.  There's a reason for that.  I decided
to spend the day AFK (Away from Keyboard).  I read no email.  I did no
programming.  I visited no social media sites.

Instead, I went to a swim meet, made [stupid choices](idiot-2019-01-13),
read a book, took a nap, and spent time with the family.  It was a nice
day.

I paid for it.  I spent an hour this morning cleaning out my inbox [1].
I feel even more behind on my class prep and other activities.  I didn't
prepare anything for the SIGCAS pre-SIGCSE workshop.

But it was worth it.  It was nice to have a quiet day [2].  I hope I can
find time for another AFK day sometime soon.

[1] Back to inbox zero!

[2] The drive to the swim meet in snow wasn't all that quiet.  But
other than that, it was quiet.

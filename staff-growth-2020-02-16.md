Among the things that seem to cause tensions between faculty and
staff, at least from the faculty side, is an enormous growth in the
number of staff positions during Kingston’s tenure, with very little,
if any, growth in the number of tenure-line faculty positions.  I’ve
heard that we added 100 plus staff positions during his tenure.  The
numbers vary---114, 140, 138---but all of them are over one hundred.

Now, I get as upset as anyone about Kingston’s seeming refusal to
consider growing the faculty or even to discuss new faculty positions
in comparison to new staff positions.  That shouldn't be a surprise;
I've raised the issue at multiple faculty meetings, in meetings
with the president, and in my musings and rants.

However, I accept that significant growth in the number of staff
was necessary. Let’s consider some reasons.

There are two clear reasons that we needed to expand the number of
staff.  As Kate Walker was fond of mentioning, we had "deferred
maintenance" on the staff.  That is, we had neglected to expand the
staff as needs for staff grew and as the number of faculty grew.  I
think, in particular, of ITS, which was not only understaffed but
also which had undercompensated staff.  I don't know that we have
enough ITS staff yet [1,2] and I'm pretty sure that they are still
somewhat undercompensated [3].  We also needed to add some positions
for federal compliance; the Title IX officer is one obvious case,
but there are likely others.  But there are also many other reasons
to add positions, some of which I'll get to a bit later in the musing.

Where did all of the positions get added?  I'm pretty sure that someone
has a list, or could easily create a list.  However, that list is not
public, or not available to me, or something like that.  So I'm just
going to report on some of those that I know about.

We added some positions in Development.  That should be a sensible
addition.  A good development officer more than pays for themself in
the funds they bring in [4].

We've had huge growth in Careers, Life, and Service.  I recall hearing
numbers on the order of twenty new positions, but I think it's a bit
less than that.  We just added another because of the unionization
discussion, someone who can look more closely at the educational benefits
of student positions.  We added a student employer manager in HR a
few years back to help bring some consistency to student employment.
Kington attributes the growth in CLS to improvements in applications and
retention. I don't think you can tie things that closely; there have been
a lot of changes.  The trend line also seems to correspond to the
increase in the number of CS majors after Grinnell was identified
as one of four CS curricular exemplars in the ACM/IEEE Computing
Curriculum recommendations [5].

Anyway, back to CLS.  Jobs are important in this economy (and in
any economy).  A strong CLS can have an important impact on our
students.  I also appreciate that CLS helps reduce my workload.
They know more about jobs than I do and can spend more time on
advice.  They can run sessions that help our students.  I've
appreciated working with the CLS Community Leader in the Sciences;
they are someone I appreciate very much.

I believe that there has been growth in HR.  I've mentioned one position
already.  I also hear a different name when employees complain about HR,
even though the old name still works there.  There may have been others.
These expansions are likely necessary, possibly for compliance reasons.

We've added folks to support the academic program.  I'm even responsible
for one of them, the half-time Peer Education and Outreach Coordinator
for Computer Science and Upper-Level Statistics, or whatever we titled
the position.  There's also the data scientist who supervises the
students in the Data Analysis and Social Inquiry Lab, or whatever
DASIL stands for.  Those are unlikely to be the only ones.

Speaking of DASIL, there's the separate issue of shifting faculty
to administrative-like roles.  I think the DASIL director gets a
course release or two.  In addition, we now have a faculty member
directing the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment, a
Center that did not previously exist.  We also have a full-time
faculty director of the Institute for Global Engagement.  The Chief
Diversity Officer is a faculty member [6].  I don't recall when we went
from two Associate Deans to three, but that also takes another
faculty member out of the classroom [8].

The CTLA and IGE are also responsible for a bunch of new positions.
CTLA has two high-level staff positions, an Academic Support
Assistant, and folks like the Curricular Technology Specialists.
The two high-level staff positions and the ASA are new.  I don't
know how many positions IGE added.  Some were certainly necessary;
with the growth in the number of International Students and the
added complexity of life for international students in the US, we
needed more people to support those students [9].  And I like that
we're thinking more about how we support broader global engagement
in the curriculum.

There's been some useful and necessary expansion in student support,
including a whole new sub-department in Student Affairs that focuses
on diversity and inclusion and a whole new department for Disability
Services.  Of course, Disability Services also supports faculty and
staff.  The broader wellness movement at Grinnell also represents
an expansion of people who support students, faculty, and staff,
although I'm not sure how many that's added.  While I think most of
the positions are in SHAW, I'm pretty sure that there are positions
elsewhere.

At some point, the administration decided to professionalize Safety
[10], replacing some student positions with staff positions.  I
thought that was an interesting decision; it was certainly a good
student position: There was time to get homework done.  Plus, you
got to work with Russ [11].  There have, of course, been other changes
to Safety.  They have a much bigger patrol area.  Plus, the new
cars are intimidating, much more so than the Honda Ridgelines!

Grinnell bought a golf course.  Well, we bought a country club, but
we mostly bought it for the golf course.  There are many factors
at play in that purchase, but it seems reasonable to ensure that
the golf course is maintained for the golf teams.  [The golf course's
staff page](https://golf.grinnell.edu/staff/) [12] says they have
two full-time staff members [14].  One of them appears to be in a
department I hadn't heard of before: Auxiliary Services and Economic
Development.  That department also lists one VP [15] and a swimming
pool manager.

Of course, new buildings, like the golf course and the expanded
HSSC require more ancillary staff, such as more members of Facilities
Management to keep them working and clean.  I don't know how many
folks were added there.

I know that Grinnell added a procurement manager sometime in the
past decade. Like the folks in development, a procurement manager
should pay for themselves, although in savings, rather than donations.
I'm still waiting for the College to set up an in-house travel
manager, which we discussed when Houston D. was still in Student
Affairs and he and someone else knew a variety of strategies for
saving money.  As far as I can tell, external travel agencies neither
save us money nor provide the additional services I'd want, such
as support when someone misses a plane.  Of course, both a procurement
manager and a travel manager can create hassles because there is
more paperwork.  But sometimes that is necessary.

It scares me that we likely need more staff.  I'd like to see a Web
Accessibility Specialist in Communications.  I know we need more
folks in ITS.  We probably need more counselors at SHAW.  It would
be cool to have a Wellness Czar separate from SHAW [16].  I'd like
a Rabbi on campus.  That may have to become a full-time position
to attract one.  I don't know where we stand on our Imam.  It's
also clear to me (and to others) that many staff members seem to
do the equivalent of at least two full-time positions.  What happens
when they retire?

Do I want more tenure-line faculty?  Yes. Do I think many of the
positions I mentioned above are at least as important or more
important than faculty positions?  Certainly; Do I think we should
be discussing whether funds should go to a new staff position or a
new faculty position [17], rather than keeping new faculty positions
completely off the table?  Obviously.  Would I like to see the list
of added (and removed) positions?  That would be enlightening.

**_Postscript_**: I would be remiss if I did not mention that I
think there's been an expansion in Senior Lecturer positions.  These
are regular, part-time positions that I think carry much better
compensation than, say, three adjunct-rate courses.

**_Postscript_**: I had hoped to draw some information from our
[Form 990s](https://www.grinnell.edu/about-grinnell/leadership-and-administration/offices-and-services/accounting/accounting-resources).  Unfortunately,
there's not much there on lower-level positions.  Surprisingly, some 
upper-level positions, such as VP for Communications, seem to appear and
disappear from the list of Officers or Key Employees.  It might be 
interesting to track the five highest-paid employees who are not officers
or "key employees" and see how it changes over the years.  But that's a
musing for another day [18].

**_Postscript_** (added after initial release): A friend reminds
me that some of the staff additions have come through specific gifts
to the College or from grants and therefore affect the College's
budget differently.

[1] And I might have chosen a different set of positions.

[2] We've also seen enormous growth in the number of systems on campus
and the number of cybersecurity issues that ITS must consider.

[3] No, I'm not using this comment to make friends among the staff;
good computer skills deserve to be compensated.

[4] I've heard Kington suggest in public meetings that, when he
arrived, there were development staff who hadn't been meeting that
goal.

[5] Yes, I'm bragging.  However, I do know that some students came to
Grinnell because of that.  More importantly, I want to challenge
Kington's narrative.  There are a host of issues that likely changed
our pool and retention.  The most important is likely the work of
our Admissions Office.

[6] The CDO [7] does not need to be a faculty member; they can come
from outside the institution.  I know that there's some debate as
to whether or not the new CDO should have faculty status.  I think
that status gives them more freedom, but I agree that it's a
complicated issue.

[7] Chief Diversity Officer, not Career Development Office or Chief
Development Officer.  Nor, I suppose, Career Development Officer,
if such a position exists.  I mention this only because, during
spell checking, I saw "CDO" and assumed I was using the CLS's old
initials.

[8] The College typically replaces faculty in Associate Dean positions
with term faculty.

[9] That may represent only one new position in IGE.

[10] Formerly Safety and Security, formerly Security.

[11] I know that Russ is retiring soon.  I wonder why there hasn't been
an all-campus announcement.  He feels like such an important part of the
Grinnell experience.

[12] Why does the Golf course get a separate Web site?

[14] Plus a dog.

[15] Did we need another VP?  Ah!  They are also responsible for the
bookstore, catering, mail services, and conference ops.  I don't think
it's a new position, just a rebranding.  The person in that role used to
be VP for College Services.

[16] I may be suggesting that position because I admire the person
who had that unofficial title.

[17] I'd rather we didn't have to put those positions in competition.
But budgets always involve some competing priorities.

[18] Don't worry, I'm unlikely to list most salaries, even though it's
public information.

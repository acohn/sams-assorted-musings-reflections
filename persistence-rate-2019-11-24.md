Persistence rates, continued
============================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), followup*

A few days ago, I mused about about [persistence rates
at Grinnell](persistence-rates-2019-11-19).  When I did so, I didn't
expect to be writing a followup musing so soon thereafter.  Instead,
I had planned to read a variety of things, including the
soon-to-be-released study on thriving at Grinnell.  and reports
from the Residential Learning Task Force and the Mental Health Task
Force of a few years back.  But things happen.  In this case, I
ended up receiving or processing a variety of indirect information
that I don't really want to leave to the side for a few weeks while
I read.

**Topic one: Four-year graduation rates**

At Monday's meeting, Dean Harris mentioned a rate of 80%.  I wasn't sure
what that rate was.  I know that our retention rate from the first-year
to the second-year is much higher than that.  I know that our six-year
graduation rate is usually in the high 80's, although I hear we dropped
to 84% recently, which is worrisome [1].

I discovered that Dean Harris was referencing our four-year graduation
rate.  Part of me worries that we keep switching our metric; a few
years ago, we talked about six-year graduation rates.  Now we're
talking about four-year graduation rates.  However, it's worth looking
at both.  For example, if we're graduating significantly more
students in six years than in four years, we should be exploring
what is preventing students from graduating in four years and
considering the effects of a later graduation.  Are students taking
nine semesters, rather than eight, which likely means that they are
incurring additional costs?  In that case, we need to think about
instituting and documenting financial aid plans that account for those
situations [2].  Are students taking a semester off, but still
spending eight semesters in school?  And, if that's the case, why
are they taking a semester off?  There may be very good reasons to
do so, or there may be things that we need to address at Grinnell
that will help.  If students have good reasons to take a semester off,
it may be fine that we have a lower four-year graduation rate.

What does our four-year graduation rate look like?  In 2018, the
year for which the most recent data are available [3], it was 78%.
That's embarrassingly low.  At least I think it's embarrassingly
low; I guess it depends on what our peers do.  Let's turn to the
data.  Here's a chart for your perusal [4].  I've tried to organize
data by 2018 four-year graduation rates.

</table>

Those data confirm that 78% is very low for our peer group.  That
worries me [5].  I expect it worries you, too.  And, even though there
is clearly some variability, we are regularly near the bottom of
our peer group.  The issue clearly needs to be addressed because
it suggests that we are not serving some of our students as well
as we should.   Although it has been phrased as a "keeping up with
our peers" issue in the past, our true motivation should be supporting
our students, and I'm glad that Dean Harris phrases it that way.

**Topic two: Workload**

I'm also glad to hear that the ever-busy and ever-thoughtful Andi
Tracy '99 [6] is spearheading an effort to gather information on
workload from course syllabi.  That's a good reason to [ask faculty
to submit their syllabi to the Dean's
office](syllabus-guidelines-2019-11-07).  And, as I understand it,
Andi is looking at a wide variety of issues, not just the quantity
of work, but also the type and distribution.

I will admit that I have some concerns about any study of course-related
workload.  Since some folks are insistent that we meet federal guidelines
about expected course workload (12 hours per week for a four-credit course),
I'd like to make sure we understand what that means and what we'll
do if we find out a course is either far under or far over that
amount.  If you're not sure what I mean by "what that means", I'm
alluding to the issue that different students spend different amounts
of time on the same assignment.  Do we measure the average time
students in a class spend?  The maximum?  The minimum?  Some
percentile?  And should Grinnell students really be our core metric?
Should we perhaps estimate based on "the average student in the
US", whatever that is?

In any case, Andi is thoughtful and well experienced in thinking
about student workload and wellness issues.  I look forward to
reading her study [8].  And I hope that we'll act on it.

**Topic three: Acting on recommendations**

On that note, I've now heard from a variety of folks that Grinnell
has done a variety of studies about these kinds of issues, but seems
to be slow to implement any of the recommendations from those studies
or the associated task forces and working groups.  In some ways,
that's not surprising; Grinnell, like many institutions, is slow
to change.  From what I heard from Dean Harris at the Faculty Meeting,
I believe that we'll still see an impact from the studies in that
people will be reading the reports and implementing appropriate
recommendations [9].

**Topic four: Academic support is not just academic support**

I was also reminded that the academic support services we put in place,
including not only Partners in Education (which I mentioned in the musing),
but also the Science Learning Center and the Math Lab, are not just
academic support services.  Many of the staff and faculty who run those
services spend as much or more time on personal issues with students
as they do on academic issues, and therefore impact the students' sense
of belonging.

**Topic five: Unintended consequences**

A few days after I posted the first musing, I received the following 
invitation from the once and future director of the CTLA.

> I am writing to ask if you would agree to lead a Faculty Friday lunch on Jan 24 on the topic of student retention.  I understand that you have written an essay on the topic in reaction to some comments by Dean Harris.  Could you kick off a discussion of the topic?
 
Why do these things happen to me?  I'm not sure I said anything of
particular import in the musing; I was just trying to gather my
thoughts.  And, as I suggested in the prior musing, I have a bunch of 
reading to do before I really understand the topic.

I'm an idiot.  So I agreed to put together a group to plan a lunchtime
discussion on retention and persistence for January 24.  Next up
is figuring out who to invite to help put it together.  I've sent
a note to a colleague who regularly teaches me a lot about these
issues.  I've sent a note to Joyce Stern, who knows more about
persistence than almost anyone on campus.  I've written to my
downstAIRs [12] neighbors.  I've sent a note to Dean Harris to get
suggestions.  I've also asked that we make it a Faculty _and Staff_
Friday [14] since the conversation needs to involve both groups
[15].  I'm glad that I have some more time to work on it.

**And beyond**

Those are the main topics I recall hearing about in the past few
days.  I'm sure I've missed a few, and that I will hear about others
in the coming days and weeks.  I'll report back again in the near
future, after I've also had a chance to read and reflect a bit more.

---

[1] I've also heard that the 84% was expected and that some 
unlikely-to-be-repeated factors played into that low rate.

[2] In my experience, Grinnell has been generous with students who need
a ninth semester to graduate.  But I don't know whether that's always
the case.  And clear documentation would reduce stress on everyone.

[3] I believe the 2018 rates represent the students who started in
2015 and who graduated by the end of May 2018.  But I could be wrong.

[4] I believe all of the data are available in IPEDS.  I hope that I've
transcribed them correctly.

[5] It worries me even though I acknowledge that there can be very good
reasons for students to take a semester off.

[6] It's taken me more than a decade to realize that her email address
is `[tracyand]`.  I wonder how many people ask "Tracy and _who_?" [7].

[7] "Inadvertently interesting Grinnell email addresses" is a good
potential topic for a musing.  Some that immediately come to mind
are "Gal Angry" (male and even-tempered) and "Perl Mutt" (neither
a dog nor a Perl programmer), but I know that there are others.

[8] Or her team's study, depending on how it's done.

[9] Or trying to implement appropriate recommendations.  We may see
some pushback from various quarters.  I've mentioned one: If you tell
faculty that they are assigning too much work, some of us (myself
included), will want to see more evidence of that.  Here's another:
Suppose there's evidence that marijuana use increases the likelihood
of students taking a semester off [10].  If the College institutes
additional policies on that use, I expect that students will express
some dissatisfaction with the limits on self-governance [11].

[10] There's more likely to be evidence of correlation, rather than
causation.

[11] Note: I am not directly aware of any use of illegal drugs on campus.
But I know that students express dissatisfaction at any impositions on
self-governance.

[12] My current office is on the second floor of 1127 Park.  Analytics
and Institutional Research (AIR) is on the first floor.

[14] My request was approved.

[15] It should also involve students, but I also think it's important 
to talk together as faculty and staff.

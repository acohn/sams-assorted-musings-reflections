Recently, I've been reflecting on how we refer to the Grinnell
Curriculum.  I tend to use "Open Curriculum", which is what we
called it when I started.  But we made the change to "Individually
Advised Curriculum" a long time ago and, arguably, it's a more
descriptive title.  After all, our curriculum is not completely
open: We require that students take Tutorial; we require that
students complete a major; we require that students take at least
thirty-two credits outside the division of their major and at least
seventy-six credits outside the department of their major [1,5].
More importantly, students do not get to choose freely; an academic
advisor must approve their selection before they can register for
courses.

But I still prefer "Open" to "Individually Advised".  It may be
less accurate but it strikes me as more catchy, for lack of a better
term.  An open curriculum sounds inviting and liberating, an
individually advised curriculum sounds, well, complicated, like
something a corporate bureacracy would design [6].  I see
that [Brown still calls their an open
curriculum](https://www.brown.edu/academics/undergraduate/open-curriculum/50).
Perhaps theirs is more open than ours.

Of course, both terms are bettere than "no requirements curriculum", which
is how Grinnell used to refer to its curriculum.  That description feels
both inaccurate and derogatory.

There has to be a better term.  "Personalized" or "Individualized" might
be okay, but both still feel a bit corporate to me.  "Individual" is
a bit stronger, but still not as powerful as "open".

I wonder if my reactions are tinged by my discipline; I certainly appreciate
the Free and Open Source movement, which is also sometimes called the
Free, Libre, and Open Source movement.  A liberal education is supposed
to free your mind from many kinds of bounds.  And that should be one of
the core aspects of a Grinnell education.  But what is special about the
Open Curriculum is that we empower students to figure out how best to
achieve their own liberal educations.  Is there a term that encompasses
that well?  

Lots of schools say that their curricula are "student-centered",
so that wouldn't work.  Our curriculum also doesn't just center on
the student, it comes from the student.  Would "collaboratively
designed curriculum" be better?  Probably not; it sounds just as 
bureaucratic as "individually advised" and it loses the role of
the individual.

*Guided Individual Curriculum"; "Discretionary Curriculum", 
"Student-Designed Curriculum".  Agh!  Why can't I find one that
works.

I asked someone in Communications.  They have no current plans to change
the name [7], but they do find it frustrating that so many people consider
it necessary to hyphenate "individually advised" [8].

[1] That's my attempt to phrase our anti-requirements as positive
requirements.  More precisely, students may not count more than 
ninety-two credits in one division toward the 124 credits required
for graduation, nor may they count more than 48 credits in one
department [2].  My description assumes that their major belongs to
a department or division, and not all majors belong to one or the other.

[2] There are a few departments that have two different disciplines; in 
those cases, I think we don't count courses in the second discipline
toward the limit for the first major.  For example, a French major with
forty-eight credits in French can count additional credits in Arabic 
toward graduation, even though French and Arabic share a department [3].

[3] The College's unwillngness to apply a similar policy to majors in
Mathematics and Computer Science was one of the factors that led to the
split of that department into two separate departments [4].

[4] It wasn't the biggest factor; I think lack of physical proximity
may have been more important, as was a clear separation of the curricula.

[5] Yes, there are others.

[6] I don't think that's what happened at Grinnell.

[7] Not that it's necessarily in their purview.

[8] A tip: You don't generally need a hyphen between an adverb and
the adjective or verb it modifies.

SIGCSE mailing list workflows
=============================

One of my professional responsibilities is co-moderator of the the SIGCSE
mailing lists [1].  As moderator, I have only a few responsibilities:
I appove or reject posts and I handle new member requests.  But it's
not quite as simple as it sounds.  Let's think about the various workflows
I must follow.

*Handling posts.*  To handle an incoming post, I skim through it and see
whether or not it seems to meet our policies.  What are those policies?
First, it should be relevant to the list.  The SIGCSE mailing list is
for discussion of computer science education.  Most members realize that.
But we get the occasional strange conference announcement.  For those, I
look for the keywords "teach", "learn", and "educa..." [2].  A conference
announcement with none of those keywords is unlikely to be relevant to
our membership [3].  There are a few exceptions for conferences that
focus on our students, but not many.

Next, I check for the secondary policies.  Does it rely on an attachment?
If so, it is not appropriate for our mailing list.  Does it quote an
inordinate amount of material?  If so, it makes the reading experience
much less good for our subscribers who read in digest form [4].

There are a few other cases, such as posts that seem irrelevant or
intended only for the original poster.

There are then three options.  I can approve the post, reject the
post, or ask the author to repost.  The first option is the easiest.
I click a link in the post, it is approved, and it goes off to the list.
The second option is a bit harder.  I need to log in to the moderation
site, find the post, and click the "reject" button.  The third option is
the most time consuming.  In that case, I write a message to the poster
to explain our policies and ask them to repost.  

It is rare that I simply reject; I think 



1. SIGCSE mailing list workflows.  Approve.  Repost. Reject.  New member request.
   N kinds of reposts/rejects: Includes a significant attachment/image 
   (we are generally a no-attachment list, but I allow small images).
   Large amounts of reposts.  (Some mailers hide cited text when you are
   replying, but a lot show it when you read.) 
   Conference announcements.  Do they have to do with SIGCSE?  Search
   for keywords "teach", "learn", "educat*".  I'm a bit more generous
   than some of my predecessors; I think I'd allow the ACM federated
   conference, if it ever happens again.

[1] SIGCSE is the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) special 
interest group for Computer Science Education.

[2] Searching for "educa" handles "educate" and "education".

[3] I don't think there's been an ACM Federated Conference while I've
been a moderator, but I'd approve that.

[4] Many mail readers hide the quoted material, so not all of our readers
know when they are quoting a lot of material.  But our typical digest
readers don't have the same experience; they have to wade through too
much repeated material.  We'd like to make their experience better.

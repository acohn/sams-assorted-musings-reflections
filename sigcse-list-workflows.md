SIGCSE mailing list workflows
=============================

*Topics/tags: [Overcommitment](index-overcommitment), SIGCSE, email, rambly*

One of my professional responsibilities is co-moderator of the the SIGCSE
mailing lists [1].  As moderator, I have only a few responsibilities:
I appove or reject posts and I handle new member requests.  But it's
not quite as simple as it sounds.  Let's think about the various workflows
I must follow.

*Handling posts.*  To handle an incoming post, I skim through it and see
whether or not it seems to meet our policies.  What are those policies?
First, it should be relevant to the list.  The SIGCSE mailing list is
for discussion of computer science education.  Most members realize that.
But we get the occasional strange conference announcement.  For those, I
look for the keywords "teach", "learn", and "educa..." [2].  A conference
announcement with none of those keywords is unlikely to be relevant to
our membership [3].  There are a few exceptions for conferences that
focus on our students, but not many.

Next, I check for the secondary policies.  Does it rely on an attachment?
If so, it is not appropriate for our mailing list.  Does it quote an
inordinate amount of material?  If so, it makes the reading experience
much less good for our subscribers who read in digest form [4].

There are also a few other cases, such as posts that seem irrelevant or
intended only for the original poster.
[I'm surprised at the number that seem to be a reply-all.  Some
clearly address a broader audience than the original sender but
many do not.]

I am then left with three options.  I can approve the post, reject the
post, or ask the author to repost.  The first option is the easiest.
I click a link in the post, the system processes the approval, and
the message goes off to the list.  The second option is a bit harder.
I need to log in to the moderation site, find the post, and click the
"reject" button.  The third option is the most time consuming.  In that
case, I also write a message to the poster.  For those who have seem to
have violated the policies, I explain those policies and ask them to repost.
For those who may have inadvertently carbon-copied the mailing list, I
check to see if that was their intent.  In the few other cases, I do 
whatever seems most appropriate.

It is rare that I simply reject; I generally think our posters deserve
the courtesy of an email.  But there are some messages that are relatively
easy to reject without additional follow.  As I noted, I generally 
reject conference announcements that are irrelevant to SIGCSE.  But there
are a few that *might* be relevant; in those cases I try to send followup.
One-line messages that are clearly intended for another poster and
not for the list rarely warrant a followup.  And, of course, spam just
gets deleted.

Unfortunately, not all submissions to the listserv come to me through email.
I get messages for current members who submit using their corresponding
email address.  However, if someone submits from an address not on the
mailing list, the only way to know that is by logging in to the administrative
interface.  [No one told me that when I started; it took me about six
months to figure it out.]  About half the mail that comes in that way is
from subscribers.



1. SIGCSE mailing list workflows.  Approve.  Repost. Reject.  New member request.
   N kinds of reposts/rejects: Includes a significant attachment/image 
   (we are generally a no-attachment list, but I allow small images).
   Large amounts of reposts.  (Some mailers hide cited text when you are
   replying, but a lot show it when you read.) 
   Conference announcements.  Do they have to do with SIGCSE?  Search
   for keywords "teach", "learn", "educat*".  I'm a bit more generous
   than some of my predecessors; I think I'd allow the ACM federated
   conference, if it ever happens again.

[1] SIGCSE is the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) special 
interest group for Computer Science Education.

[2] Searching for "educa" handles "educate" and "education".

[3] I don't think there's been an ACM Federated Conference while I've
been a moderator, but I'd approve that.

[4] Many mail readers hide the quoted material, so not all of our readers
know when they are quoting a lot of material.  But our typical digest
readers don't have the same experience; they have to wade through too
much repeated material.  We'd like to make their experience better.

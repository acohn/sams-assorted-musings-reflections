Persnickety
===========

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

Every time we get a set of minutes from the faculty meeting, I read
through them to remind myself what happened.  Invariably, I find
something that I think should be corrected.  So I send a note to
appropriate folks.  I also find that I identify potential corrections
in a host of documents I read.

Here are two recent examples.

* The minutes for the Faculty Meeting of May 6, 2019, provided a list of
  faculty promoted to associate professor with tenure.  However, two of
  those faculty were hired as associate professors a few years previous,
  and were only tenured in spring 2019.  Another one was hired as a full
  professor, with tenure.  So saying that they were "promoted to associate
  professor with tenure" is incorrect.  I sent a note to the Dean and to
  the Secretary of the Faculty.
* The list of newly hired faculty indicated that our new chaired professor
  was hired as an associate professor and indicated that they were in the
  Educaiton department.  I thought both of those claims were false.  It
  also indicated that our new Dean was "tenure-track".  Don't we hire 
  Dean's with tenure?  I sent those questions to the Dean [1].

Sometimes I wonder, *Am I too persnickety?*  The answer is almost
certainly **Yes**.  But I'm not sure that I can change.  And I'm
also not sure taht I can always make the distinctio between when it's
appropriate to be persnickety

[1] It turns out that the Trustees have not yet approved the Dean's tenure.
That will [should] happen at their next meeting.

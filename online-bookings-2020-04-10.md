For many years, I held mostly "open" office hours.  That is, I set
times that I would be in my office and took students in a first-come,
first-served basis.  I also allowed some signup times, particularly
during preregistration.  And, because it's me [1], I also had an
open-door policy, approximately, "If my door is open, you can come
in and ask questions.  However, understand that I may not always
be up to answering them at the time."

At some point, I decided that I would be better having office-hour
sign-ups, rather than completely open office hours.  Why?  Mostly
because I didn't like students having to wait their turn in the
hallway, but also because that process sometimes ended with students
still waiting when my office hours were over and I had to go off
to class or a meeting or something else.  So I moved to a sign-up
sheet outside my office, with fifteen-minute appointments.  Fifteen
minutes was not enough for some meetings, and too much for others,
but it generally worked.  And at least students knew when they were
meeting with me.  If a meeting was short or no one was signed up
during a slot, I took walk-ins.  These are still my practices.  And
there are variants.  For example, I've had a few semesters in which
I had students sign up for a regular weekly appointment or appointments.
These are usually students with great tenacity and a growth mindset,
but who struggle with CS.  I'm happy to support them.

I like this new approach (or these need approaches).  But it (they)
needed some updates.  With a sign-up sheet outside my office, I
would only know what appointments I had when I was in my office.  And
students would often email me to see if I had open slots and, if so,
when those were.  So I decided to switch to online bookings.

I started with youcanbook.me.  My wonderful instructors at Global
Online Academy used it.  And it had a really nice design; I could
mark times as "Office Hours" in my Google Calendar, and they would 
automatically appear on my youcanbook.me booking calendar.  That
made it easy to make adjustments on the fly, such as adding office
hours when students are working on an exam, or removing them when
I am out of town.  I used it for a few years.  I also asked ITS if
they supported something similar, but the answer was "No."

Then youcanbook.me decided that taking the times from my Google
calendar was a premium feature.  It may also have removed other
features I cared about.  I don't remember.  All I know is that I'm
a cheapskate.  So I went looking for another solution.  Eventually,
I settled on Acuity Scheduling.  It wasn't quite as easy to
use as youcanbook.me, but it got the job done.  Most importantly,
it was relatively easy for my students to use and it put their
appointments on one of my calendars.

On Tuesday, the College released a memo indicating that we should
avoid software not approved by the College.  There isn't a complete
list of approved software available, but one of the approved lists
did suggest that we have a license for Microsoft Booking.  So
yesterday, I tried to figure out how to use it.  I think I have hte
basics set up, at least for now.  So I can step back and think a
bit about the aspects I like or don't like [2].

Microsoft does not understand short URLs.  Where youcanbook.me gave
me <https://rebelsky.youcanbook.me> and Acuity Scheduling gave me
<https://rebelsky.as.me>, Microsoft insists on
<https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/SamuelARebelsky@grinco.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/>.
I don't think my students will be able to remember that, and I
certainly can't fit it on the paper hang tags I usually put outside
my office.  Fortunately, I have an account on bit.ly, so I've set
up <https://bit.ly/book-samr>.  Not quite as elegant, but it works.

Microsoft does not seem to have embraced the idea of free-form input
or automatic data incorporation.  It doesn't share youcanbook.me's
ability to draw from a calendar.  It doesn't share Acuity Scheduling's
parsing of user input.  That is, rather than saying "I'm available 8-11
next Tuesday", I get to fill out a form for start time and end time.

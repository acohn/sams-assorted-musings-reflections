At a recent faculty meeting, we learned that many Grinnell staff feel
that faculty (either individually or as an entity) disrespect them.  I've
mentioned this issue in the past; I will admit that I didn't know how 
bad it is.  I will also admit that, as I heard some of the comments, I
am likely responsible for some of those feelings of disrespect.  We need
to change.  *I* need to change.  And I've been trying.

At the same time, I worry that some underlying issues won't or can't
change.  I'm not sure whether or not I should write about them, but
I feel that I have to raise them.  In particular, it appears that some
of the feelings stem from a sense that "I am an expert in X / have a 
degree in X so faculty members shouldn't question me."  I'm sorry, but
being questioned, even in your area of expertise, is part of life.

I'll start with one of the stories that makes me believe that I am
likely responsible for some feelings of disrespect.  A few years
back, Communications decided to write a story about our Software
Design class.  It's a wonderful class, mostly because of the work
of my colleagues Janet Davis in CS and Susan Sanning in CLS.  I
just teach it.  I was happy to have them write a story.  But when
I got the story, I told them it was unacceptable.  And it was.  Why?
Because it only mentioned men.  Male students.  Male alumni mentors.
A male teacher.  Now, we have awesome women alumni mentors for the
class, and we have wonderful women who take the class.  The piece
could have quoted or mentioned them.  I wrote back something to
that effect, along with a phrase like "This is unacceptable in the
present form; it is dangerous to the things we try to achieve in
our department." And I believe that.  To say that our further
conversations were less than productive is an understatement.  The
author felt that I was undermining their expertise as a journalist.
But issues of presentation and gender in computing are a subject
I've studied for a long time.  I stood my ground.  Eventually,
someone stepped in to mediate and I think we ended up with an article
that we were both happy with.  Should I have been more polite?
Certainly.  These days, I likely would have been.  Should the
journalist have understood that my concerns were valid?  Yes.  Should
they have felt a lack of respect?  I would hope not, since my intent
was not to disrespect them, but to raise an important issue that
they may not have known about.  But I can understand how they may
have felt that way.  Did I feel a lack of respect from them?
Certainly.  They appeared not to care at all about my very real
concerns.  Did we resolve our differences.  Yes, but we needed help.

I see expertise questioned regularly at the College.  Mike Latham
regularly asked me to consider teaching introductory CS to a class
of sixty students, even though I know much more about the effects
of large classes at Grinnell, particularly with regards to the
experience of students in the discipline.  Did I think he didn't
respect me?  No.  I just thought he was trying to explore other options
and, given no good ones, wanted me to think more broadly.  Our VP of
Admissions did his Ph.D. on the benefits of merit aid.  Does that stop
President Kington or the Trustees from questioning him about whether
we really need merit aid?  Nope.

Sometimes people miss things.  Story about ITS and ProofPoint.

My expertise gets ignored all the time.  I've been doing research on
the Web since more or less there was a Web.  (I have a piece in the
second International Conference on the World-Wide Web.)  Did people
ignore my comments about usability and the Web?  Certainly.

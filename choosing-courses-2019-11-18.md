Choosing courses
================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), [autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

This past week, during preregistration, I had one of those meetings with
an advisee that faculty both look forward to and dread.  It started
something like this.

> I'm done with my CS major.  That means that I can take almost
anything next semester.  I know that I have the skills to teach
myself many things.  What classes should I take?

They also asked me about faculty they should take courses from.  That's
something I tend to avoid discussing with my students.  I have a slew
of wonderful colleagues, so it's hard to prioritize any particular person.
I also know that different students react differently to the same
faculty member; one student's most influential faculty member can be
another student's regretted class.

We worked out way too many courses for the student to consider and then
narrowed them to a more reasonable set.  Since it's a student I trust,
I left all of the courses we'd talked about as "approved" so that they
could make a change after sleeping on it.

However, reading through the course list with the student got me
thinking: What courses would I take if I had the time to do so?
That's not a totally hypothetical question.  I'm on leave in the
spring, and could sit in on a course or two.  I've certainly done
so in the past.  And, even if I'm not going to sit in on courses,
it's nice to think about what courses I might take.

On the one hand, I realize that almost any course would likely be good
to teach.  As I noted, I have excellent colleagues.  And, as we tell
our students, it's good to explore a bit beyond your comfort zone.  Now,
I wouldn't take a 400-level course in a foreign language.  Nonetheless,
I could certainly try a wide variety of other things.

I've also been fortunate to take a lot of courses with colleagues
I respect.  I've attended full semesters of Ira Strauber's
_Constitutional Law_ [1], Erik Simpson's _Lighting the Page_ [2], Vida
Praitis' _Advanced Genetics_, Tom Moore's _Applied Statistics_, Bio 251
[3], Susan Strauber's _Introduction to Art History_, Jeremy Chen's
_Introduction to the Studio_ and _Sculpture_, and perhaps one or two
others that I've forgotten.  I've also been able to attend part of
a semester of Jenny Anger's _Art Since 1945_ and Andrew Kaufman's
_Digital Art_.  I've watched a wide variety of colleagues guest teach
in my section of TEC 154.  I've attended workshops led by Elizabeth
Dobbs (Dr. Syntax), Brad Bateman (Tutorial), Karla Erickson (Mid-Career
Faculty), and many, many more.  I've attended lectures by a host
of colleagues.  The list goes on and on.  But there's always the
opportunity to do more.

I'm sorry that I missed the opportunity to sit in on one of V.
Brown's classes.  I hear that she was the pinacle of organization.
I'll never be that, but it would be good to see someone who is.  I
had hoped to take _Drawing_ and _Ceramics_ from Jill Schrift.  I
guess that will never happen.  I certainly had fun talking to her
about both courses.

I guess that's enough with memories of times passed [4].  Let's
look at next semester's courses.  As I said, there's likely a benefit
to taking almost any course.  But I'm going to focus on some that
seem most interesting at the present.  I also realize that I might
choose a different set of courses on a different day.

The most obvious choice is Ralph Savarese's _Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_.  Why?  Well, I write a lot of nonfiction.  I have the
conceit that my work is creative.  But I also know that I have lots
of room for improvement.  Ralph would be a no-bullshit instructor.
I'm surprised to see that there are open slots in the course.  But
it's at 8:00 a.m., and, well, students don't seem to like 8:00 a.m.
courses.  It seems hard to be creative at that time of day.

I'd also like to take Justin Thomas' _Digital Media Design_ because
I'm interested in the intersection between technology and the arts.
I also think that Justin would be fun to have a class from.  I'm
surprised to see that there's room in that course, too.

I'd love to participate in Karla Erickson's _Research on Robots_.  I
think I do fairly well at considering the broader implications of
technology.  But thinking about modern technological issues in the
context of a sociology seminar would certainly expand my perspectives.
Unfortunately, I couldn't take that course and Ralph's, because they
meet at the same time.  And, like Ralph's class, it has some room.

On that note, I should probably consider taking Jennifer Dobe's
_Ethical Theory_.  It's an opportunity for me to get more formal
training in those issues so that I can better apply them to my
own field.  And it also has room.  Why is that my interest varies
so much from that of Grinnell students?

Kathy Kamp and Lesley Wright's _Designing Museum Displays_ sounds
like a ton of fun and a chance to expand my thinking in new ways.
I'd enjoy thinking about displays for the HSSC.  It would also be
nice to think more about the displays on Noyce 3rd.  Unfortunately,
this course would be the hardest to take of those I've listed, as it
is significantly over-enrolled.

Johanna Meehan's _Reading Arendt_ would be awesome, but also awesomely
challenging.  I'm reasonably intelligent, but I sometimes struggle
with deep philosophy.  Arendt's philosophy is really important and
Johanna is brilliant.  Why does this course have room?

Returning closer to home, I'd like to sit in on Jerod Weinman's
_Artificial Intelligence_.  As I've mentioned recently, AI has
become a core CS discipline.  It's certainly much different than
the AI course I took in 1986 or so, when all I could think was
"All these algorithms appear to be exponential."  I also realize
that although AI is close to my field, the course would require a
lot of my time.

Staying within the Science division, I should also consider taking
one of the sections of _Introduction to Psychology_.  It was mom's
field, after all.  And while I studied some psychology in my social
studies core course at UofC [5], there's always the opportunity to
take more.

I've mentioned Katya and Leslie's _Racing Genetics_ in a previous
musing.  It would be interesting to see the two of them teaching
together.  I also learn something new from each of them whenever
we talk.  But that course is also over-full.

One of my regrets from my undergraduate days is that I never
tried to get into Bevington's _Shakespeare_.  But whenever I had
the opportunity to enroll early, I prioritized getting into one
of Gerald Mast's film classes.  I don't regret that decision, but
I should have found a way to try to take Bevington, too.  Anyway,
I hear that taking one of John Garrison's Shakespeare courses would 
be a reasonable substitute.  I see that he and Kelly Maynard are
teaching _Shakespeare in the Mediterranean_.  That would be cool,
particularly since John tells me that it has a study abroad component.
I know that I can't get into that course, since it has an application
process and it's only for first-year students.  But I'll add courses
from Kelly and John to my long-term plans.

Speaking of long-term plans, I should find a way to sit in on Sarah
Purcell's _Digital History_.  I'd love to see Sarah's take on 
the digital humanities.

Mark Laver _Jazz Traditions_ would be a good experience.  I enjoy
jazz, but I don't have deep enough knowledge to really understand
what I'm listening to.

Jenny Anger is teaching _Art Since 1945_ again.  I enjoyed the
part sof that course I could attend, and would like the chance to
continue learning more about the matter.  I find that the more I
learn about art, the better it informs whatever practice I have the
time for.  It also heightens my enjoyment of the museums I visit.

I don't know Alexander Marcus.  But I think it would be interesting
to sit in on his special topic course on Israel and Palestine.  I
have some knowledge about the situation, but that knowledge is not
deep enough.  I have opinions, but I'd like them to be better informed
opinions.

I see that Georgeanna Robinson is teaching her _How Colleges Work_
special topic course again.  I had hoped to sit in on that course 
last year.  I'd like to say "maybe this year", but it's at the same
time as way too many other courses I'd like to sit in on.  Oh well,
at least I have the readings.

I love David Campbell's writing.  And his lecture in the _Liberal
Arts and Vocation_ series was wonderful [6].  When we talk, I'm
always impressed by his depth of knowledge and his thoughtfulness.
So I should consider sitting in on _Nations and the Global Environment_.
I also think mom tried to take that class when she moved to town.  But
right now, that course is significantly over-enrolled.

What about my student's suggestion of taking something from a
life-changing faculty member?  I'll admit that my experience will
likely be different than that of my students.  And I don't want to
single out a particular faculty member, so I'll just single out a
department.  When I think about the courses that my students find
most transformational, I'd say that Sociology is the department
they mention most frequently.  So I'll add "take a Sociology course"
to my wish list.

Okay, I've now listed about four semesters worth of classes, if not
more.  And I know that I've missed a huge number of other potential
courses that I'd love taking.  Maybe it's time to retire and go
back to school.

---

[1] I was suffering from hypersomnia that semester.  I'm glad that Ira
was willing to put up with it.

[2] That's Erik's course on digital humanities and literature.

[3] Why can't I remember who taught Bio 251?  

[4] Or is that "times past"?  Or perhaps just "the past".

[5] I refuse to use UChicago.  It was UofC when I was there, and it
will remain UofC in my mind.

[6] All of the lectures in that series were wonderful.  But Brad
Bateman and Kathleen Skerrett are gone from Grinnell, so I can't
take classes from them.

Choosing courses
================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), [autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

This past week, during preregistration, I had one of those meetings with
an advisee that faculty both look forward to and dread.  It started
something like this.

> I'm done with my CS major.  That means that I can take almost
anything next semester.  I know that I have the skills to teach
myself many things.  What classes should I take?

They also asked me about faculty they should take courses from.  That's
something I try to avoid discussing with my students.  I have a
slew of wonderful colleagues, so it's hard to prioritize any
particular person.  I also know that different students react
differently to the same faculty member; one student's most influential
faculty member can be another student's regretted class.  But I
also acknowledge that there's a small cadre of faculty who regularly
appear in students' comments that "this person made a huge positive
difference in my life".  So I probably mentioned a few potential
courses, prefacing them with "My students tell me that ..."

We identified way too many courses for the student to consider and then
narrowed them to a more reasonable set.  Since it's a student I trust,
I left all of the courses we'd talked about as "approved" so that they
could make a change after sleeping on it and talking to friends [1].

Reading through the course list with the student got me thinking:
What courses would I take if I had the time to do so?  That's not
a totally hypothetical question.  I'm on leave in the spring, and
could sit in on a course or two.  I've certainly done so in the
past.  And, even if I'm not going to sit in on courses, it's nice
to think about what courses I might take.

Like my student, I've learned how to learn.  But I've also learned that
I learn better in an environment in which learning is guided and structured
by someone who better understands the material, and in an environment in
which I learn from a variety of people around me.  That is, small classes
are better for me.

On the one hand, I realize that almost any course would likely be
valuable for me to take.  As I noted, I have excellent colleagues.
And, as we tell our students, it's good to explore a bit beyond
your comfort zone.  Now, it would often be good to have prerequisites.
Fore example, I wouldn't take a 400-level course in a foreign
language.  Nonetheless, I could certainly try a wide variety of
topics.  My colleagues have also been known to waive prerequisites 
when appropriate.

I've been fortunate to take a lot of courses with colleagues I
respect.  I've attended full semesters of Ira Strauber's _Constitutional
Law_ [2], Erik Simpson's _Lighting the Page_ [3], Vida Praitis'
_Advanced Genetics_, Tom Moore's _Applied Statistics_, Bio 251 [4],
Susan Strauber's _Introduction to Art History_, Jeremy Chen's
_Introduction to the Studio_ and _Sculpture_, and perhaps one or
two others that I've forgotten.  I've been able to attend part of
a semester of Jenny Anger's _Art Since 1945_ and Andrew Kaufman's
_Digital Art_.  I've taken Bowling from Brian Jaworski and Tennis
from Andy Hamilton.  

Of course, learning from colleagues goes beyond their courses. I've
watched a wide variety of colleagues guest teach in my section of
TEC 154.  I've attended workshops led by Elizabeth Dobbs (Dr.
Syntax), Brad Bateman (Tutorial), Karla Erickson (Mid-Career Faculty),
Andi Tracy and Jen Jacobsen (Student Wellness), and many, many more.
I've attended lectures by a host of colleagues.  I even have a box
set of lectures on DVD by Tyler Roberts buried somewhere in my lab.
The list goes on and on.  But there's always the opportunity to
learn more.

I'm sorry that I missed the opportunity to sit in on one of V.
Brown's classes.  I hear that she was the pinnacle of organization.
I'll never be that, but it would be good to see someone who is.  I
had hoped to take _Drawing_ and _Ceramics_ from Jill Schrift.  I
guess that will never happen.  I certainly had fun talking to her
about both courses.

I guess that's enough with memories of times passed [5].  Let's
look at next semester's courses.  As I said, there's likely a benefit
to taking almost any course.  But I'm going to focus on some that
seem most interesting at the present.  I also realize that I might
choose a different set of courses on a different day.

The most obvious choice is Ralph Savarese's _Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_.  Why?  Well, I write a lot of nonfiction.  I have the
conceit that my work is creative.  But I also know that I have lots
of room for improvement.  Ralph would be a no-bullshit instructor.
I'm surprised to see that there are open slots in the course.  But
it's at 8:00 a.m., and, well, students don't seem to like 8:00 a.m.
courses.  It seems hard to be creative at that time of day.

Even though I write a lot, I know that Ralph's class would be
challenging.  As I've said before, I write workman-like prose; while
I may have interesting ideas [6] and have developed an authorial
voice of sorts, my writing lacks many of the characteristics I
associate with creative nonfiction, particularly attention to
language, sound, and rhythm.  I don't necessarily think about those
issues when I'm reading, and I certainly don't pay close enough
attention to them when I'm writing.

While we're on the topic of creative writing courses, Dean Bakopoulos'
writing seminar on screenwriting [7] would certainly push me in new
directions.  I don't have a particular interest in screenwriting,
but the course would certainly help me reflect on language use and
listening more carefully to others.  Plus, I think it would be a blast
to take a course from Dean.  Why are there open slots in this course?

I'd love take Justin Thomas' _Digital Media Design_, primarily
because I'm interested in the intersection between technology and
the arts, but also because I know that Justin would be fun to have
a class from.  I'm surprised to see that there's room in that course,
too.

I'd love to participate in Karla Erickson's _Research on Robots_.  I
think I do fairly well at considering the broader implications of
technology.  But thinking about modern technological issues in the
context of a sociology seminar would certainly expand my perspectives.
Unfortunately, I couldn't take that course and Ralph's, because they
meet at the same time.  And, like Ralph's class, it has some room.

On that note, I should probably consider taking Jennifer Dobe's
_Ethical Theory_.  It's an opportunity for me to get more formal
training in those issues so that I can better apply them to my
own field.  And it also has room.  Why is that my interest varies
so much from that of Grinnell students?

Kathy Kamp and Lesley Wright's _Designing Museum Displays_ sounds
like a ton of fun and a chance to expand my thinking in new ways.
I'd enjoy thinking about displays for the HSSC.  It would also be
nice to think more about the displays on Noyce 3rd.  Unfortunately,
this course would be the hardest to take of those I've listed, as it
is significantly over-enrolled.

Johanna Meehan's _Reading Arendt_ would be awesome, but also awesomely
challenging.  I'm reasonably intelligent, but I sometimes struggle
with deep philosophy.  Arendt's philosophy is really important and
Johanna is brilliant.  Why does this course have room?

Returning closer to home, I'd like to sit in on Jerod Weinman's
_Artificial Intelligence_.  As I've mentioned recently, AI has
become a core CS discipline.  It's certainly much different than
the AI course I took in 1986 or so, when all I could think was
"All these algorithms appear to be exponential."  I also realize
that although AI is close to my field, the course would require a
lot of my time.

Staying within the Science division, I should also consider taking
one of the sections of _Introduction to Psychology_.  It was mom's
field, after all.  And while I studied some psychology in my social
studies core course at UofC [8], there's always the opportunity to
take more.

I've mentioned Katya and Leslie's _Racing Genetics_ in a previous
musing.  It would be interesting to see the two of them teaching
together.  I also learn something new from each of them whenever
we talk.  But that course is also over-full.

One of my regrets from my undergraduate days is that I never
tried to get into Bevington's _Shakespeare_.  But whenever I had
the opportunity to enroll early, I prioritized getting into one
of Gerald Mast's film classes.  I don't regret that decision, but
I should have found a way to try to take Bevington, too.  Anyway,
I hear that taking one of John Garrison's Shakespeare courses would 
be a reasonable substitute.  I see that he and Kelly Maynard are
teaching _Shakespeare in the Mediterranean_.  That would be cool,
particularly since John tells me that it has a study abroad component.
I know that I can't get into that course, since it has an application
process and it's only for first-year students.  But I'll add courses
from Kelly and John to my long-term plans.

Speaking of long-term plans, I should find a way to sit in on Sarah
Purcell's _Digital History_.  I'd love to see Sarah's take on 
the digital humanities.  I'd also like to take a linguistics course
from Cynthia Hansen or Angelo Mercado.

Mark Laver's _Jazz Traditions_ would be a good experience.  I enjoy
jazz, but I don't have deep enough knowledge to really understand
what I'm listening to.

Jenny Anger is teaching _Art Since 1945_ again.  I enjoyed the
parts of that course I could attend, and would like the chance to
continue learning more about the matter.  I find that the more I
learn about art, the better it informs whatever practice I have the
time for.  It also heightens my enjoyment of the museums I visit.

I don't know Alexander Marcus.  But I think it would be interesting
to sit in on his special topic course on Israel and Palestine.  I
have some knowledge about the situation, but that knowledge is not
deep enough.  I have opinions, but I'd like them to be better informed
opinions.

I see that Georgeanna Robinson is teaching her _How Colleges Work_
special topic course again.  I had hoped to sit in on that course
last year.  I'd like to say "maybe this year", but it's at the same
time as way too many other courses I'd like to sit in on.  Oh well,
at least I have the readings.  I was surprised that the enrollment
in this course was so low.  Since Georgeanna is downstairs, I heard
from her that there was a delay in getting it listed, so it didn't
appear until midway through preregistration.  I hope it still gets
offered.  Georgeanna tells me that while it's useful for all students,
it's particularly useful for first-gen and first-year students, who
benefit from learning more about the structure of the institution.

I love David Campbell's writing.  And his lecture in the _Liberal
Arts and Vocation_ series was wonderful [9].  When we talk, I'm
always impressed by his depth of knowledge and his thoughtfulness.
So I should consider sitting in on _Nations and the Global Environment_.
I also think mom tried to take that class when she moved to town.  But
right now, that course is significantly over-enrolled.

What about my student's suggestion of taking something from a
life-changing faculty member?  I'll admit that my experience will
likely be different than that of my students.  And I don't want to
single out a particular faculty member, so I'll just single out a
department.  When I think about the courses that my students find
transformational, I'd say that Sociology is the department they
mention most frequently.  So I'll add "take a Sociology course" to
my wish list.

Okay, I've now listed about four semesters worth of classes, if not
more.  And I know that I've missed a huge number of other potential
courses that I'd love taking.  Maybe it's time to retire and go
back to school.

Postscript: Near the beginning of this musing, I noted that my list
would normally change if I wrote it at a different time.  And I was
right.  Even though I'd been thinking about this issue for a few
days, sleeping on it another night revealed even more courses I'd
like to take.  For example, it would be nice to take a core course
in Education [10] so that I had firmer grounding in the work that I
do.  It would also be nice to take an introductory Chemistry course
so that I could have some idea what middle son does.  Talking to
eldest also reminds me that background in Economics would help me
better understand the world.  I would also benefit from taking at
least one course in Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies.  However,
they don't allow seniors to pre-register for the intro course, so I
expect that I couldn't get in.

What else? Since Monessa Cummins is on leave this semester, I
neglected to list one of her courses.  But if she could put up with
me, I'd like to sit in on one of her courses [11].

In terms of particular courses, I'd like to sit in on Joe Mileti's
_Combinatorics & Number Theory_.  While I was a math major as an
undergrad, and likely know much of the material, doing math makes
me happy.  Certainly, the one day a week I sat in on Titus Klinge's
_Automata, Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity_ reminded
me of how much I enjoy problem solving in formal systems; I expect
that Joe's course would give me the same feeling.  The last time I
took number theory was in a summer math camp at the University of
Chicago.  I also think that I'd appreciate Joe's style more than
that of Raghavan Narasimhan; I certainly wouldn't expect Joe to
fill twenty-seven chalkboards in an hour-long class [12].

That reminds me.  I should probably muse about the faculty and
courses who had the most powerful influence on me as a student.
But that's a topic for another musing.

What else?  I'd mentioned Peter-Michael Osera's _HCI and Programming_
in an earlier musing.  That's a topic I'd like to think more about.
However, I'd prefer it in the context of a small seminar, rather than
the larger class it seems to have become [14].

When I add these courses, I'm now up to five full-time
semesters or more of courses to take.  How do students choose?  And
why do some tell me that they can't find anything of interest?

---

[1] It looks like they left the list as is.

[2] I was suffering from hypersomnia that semester.  I'm glad that Ira
was willing to put up with it.

[3] That's Erik's course on digital humanities and literature.

[4] Why can't I remember who taught Bio 251?  

[5] Or is that "times past"?  Or perhaps just "the past".

[6] Or so I hope.

[7] Since it's about writing for TV, would that be smallscreenwriting?
And how should I notate that term? Is it small-screenwriting or
smallscreen writing or ...?

[8] I refuse to use UChicago.  It was UofC when I was there, and it
will remain UofC in my mind.

[9] All of the lectures in that series were wonderful.  But Brad
Bateman and Kathleen Skerrett are gone from Grinnell, so I can't
take classes from them.

[10] Most likely, _Educational Principles in a Pluralistic Society_.

[11] It's been way too many years since I took Latin, so I'd probably
choose either introductory Latin or one of the courses that does not
require knowledge of classical languages.

[12] Maybe it was ninety minutes.  I just remember that he looked
worn out at the end of each class.  Our brains certainly were.

[14] I realize that twenty (or twenty-four) students is, in fact,
a "small seminar" at some institutions.  Nonetheless, at Grinnell, it
feels more like a large class.

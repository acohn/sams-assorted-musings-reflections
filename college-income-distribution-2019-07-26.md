Income distributions, college choices, and such
===============================================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia), data junkie, long, rambly*

A few years ago, the _New York Times_
published an interactive data set entitled
"[Some Colleges Have More
Students From the Top 1 Percent
Than the Bottom 60](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html)".  I keep getting
sent back to that data set, whether it be in a talk at the Tapia Celebration,
a reading group on _The Privileged Poor_ [1], or [a crappy article from
_Medium_](https://medium.com/s/no-mercy-no-malice/how-i-got-here-eb3ca0aa98d2) [2].  Today I decided to a slightly deeper dive into the data.

It's depressing to see how many of our peers appear at the top of
the list.  Colorado College is second, with 24.2% of their students in
the studied group from the top 1% and 10.5% of their students from the
bottom 60%.  Washington and Lee is third, with 19.1% from the top 1% and 8.4 from the
bottom 60% [3].  Kenyon is eighth, with 19.8% from the top 1% and 12.2 from
the bottom 65%.

How about Grinnell?  Let's see.  We are 182nd, with 5.5% of our students 
from the top 1% [4] and 24.6% from the bottom 60%.    I wonder where
we rank relative to the comparison group we use for various studies [9].
Let's see.

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Rank</th>
    <th>Institution</th>
    <th>Top 1%</th>
    <th>Bottom 60%</th>
    <th>Ratio</th>

  <tr> <td>002</td><td>Colorado</td><td>24.2</td><td>10.5</td> <td>2.30</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>003</td><td>Washington and Lee</td><td>19.1</td><td>8.4</td> <td>2.27</td></tr>

  <tr> <td>033</td><td>Davidson</td><td>17.4</td><td>16.4</td> <td>1.06</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>042</td><td>Carleton</td><td>14.4</td><td>15.5</td> <td>0.93</td></tr>

  <tr> <td>066</td><td>Oberlin</td><td>9.3</td><td>13.3</td> <td>0.70</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>071</td><td>Pomona</td><td>14.2</td><td>21.8</td> <td>0.65</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>082</td><td>St. Olaf</td><td>8.3</td><td>15.3</td> <td>0.54</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>096</td><td>Swarthmore</td><td>9.0</td><td>18.2</td> <td>0.49</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>109</td><td>Reed</td><td>7.8</td><td>18.0</td> <td>0.43</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>126</td><td>Vassar</td><td>9.3</td><td>26.1</td> <td>0.36</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>140</td><td>Macalester</td><td>6.8</td><td>22.0</td> <td>0.31</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>182</td><td>Grinnell</td><td>5.5</td><td>24.6</td> <td>0.22</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>230</td><td>Smith</td><td>4.4</td><td>27.2</td> <td>0.16</td></tr>
</table>

We're almost at the bottom [10].  In some sense, that's good; we're serving
an implicit part of our mission to provide a top-quality undergraduate
education to students who could not otherwise afford such an education.
The comparatively small percentage of those from the top 1% may also be
a good thing in other ways; it means that students are less comfortable
with open displays of wealth, something that can make other students
feel like outsiders [11].

There are, of course, also some significant disadvantages associated with
having limited numbers of students from the top 1%.  Not surprisingly,
as you look to grow the endowment [14] you're much more likely to get
large donations from that group than even those in the rest of the top
10%; after all, the 1% usually have more much available to give.  As
we look toward opportunities for our students, there are also advantages to 
having a reasonable set of wealthy students.  In part, it means that when
students network [16], they have connections to a broader group.  I don't
know if there has been a formal study of this third issue, but I would expect 
that there's a hidden benefit to enrolling high-income students: It 
increases the odds those who hire for that high-end jobs will have heard
of the institution: "Oh, yeah, I've heard of Grinnell.  It's a good school.
My nephew (or colleague's daughter, or whatever) went there." [17]

So, although I'm proud of our ratio, and firmly believe that a central
part of our mission is to support talented students who could not
otherwise afford an elite liberal arts education, I can understand some
of the reasons the Trustees want more full-pay students.

I guess that covers the first part of the [18] _Times_ article:
I'm proud, I wonder about the effects of international students on the data,
and I think it's worth considering other implications.

---

I'd forgotten, but I see that the article also has a table of "elite colleges
that enroll the highest percentage of low- and middle-income students". As
far as I can tell, these data come from Pell recipients.  Let's see
how we stand relative to our peers.

<table class="table">
  <tr><th>Rank</th><th>Institution</th> <th>Pct. from bottom 40%</th></tr>
  <tr><td>04</td><td>Grinnell</td> <td>14.3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>04</td><td>Smith</td> <td>14.2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>05</td><td>Vassar</td> <td>13.8</td></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td><td>Amherst</td> <td>12.0</td></tr>
  <tr><td>17</td><td>Williams</td> <td>11.2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>19</td><td>Macalester</td> <td>10.8</td></tr>

  <tr><td>72</td><td>Kenyon</td> <td>4.8</td></tr>
  <tr><td>74</td><td>Washington and Lee</td> <td>4.5</td></tr>
</table>

Hmmm ... two tables.  I think that means that I can combine the data to see
the ratio of 1%-ers to those in the bottom two quintiles.

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>Institution</th>
    <th>Top 1%</th>
    <th>Bottom 40%</th>
    <th>Ratio</th>
  </tr>

  <tr> <td>Colorado</td><td>24.2</td><td>4.9</td> <td>4.9</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Kenyon</td><td>19.8</td><td>4.2</td> <td>4.7/td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Washington and Lee</td><td>19.1</td><td>4.5</td> <td>4.2</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Bowdoin</td><td>20.4</td><td>9.2</td> <td>2.2</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Davidson</td><td>17.4</td><td>8.2</td> <td>2.1</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Carleton</td><td>14.4</td><td>7.9</td> <td>1.8</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Amherst</td><td>21.1</td><td>12.0</td> <td>1.8</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Williams</td><td>18.1</td><td>11.2</td> <td>1.6</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Oberlin</td><td>9.3</td><td>6.2</td> <td>1.5</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>St. Olaf</td><td>8.3</td><td>6.2</td> <td>1.3</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Pomona</td><td>14.2</td><td>10.7</td> <td>1.3</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Swarthmore</td><td>9.0</td><td>10.6</td> <td>0.8</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Reed</td><td>7.8</td><td>9.5</td> <td>0.8</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Vassar</td><td>9.3</td><td>13.8</td> <td>0.7</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Macalester</td><td>6.8</td><td>10.8</td> <td>0.6</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Grinnell</td><td>5.5</td><td>14.3</td> <td>0.4</td></tr>
  <tr> <td>Smith</td><td>4.4</td><td>14.2</td> <td>0.3</td></tr>
</table>

I didn't learn much from that exercise; the schools stayed mostly in
the same order.  The one thing I did learn is that most schools, except
Grinnell, seem to have about the same number of students from the middle
quintile and the bottom two quintiles.  Grinnell, in contrast, has about
one-and-a-half times as many  from the bottom two quintiles as from the
middle quintile.  At a recent discussion, some of us had noted that we seem 
to have fewer middle-income students than in the past; I wonder if this is
evidence thereof.

---

That second table I grabbed from the _Times_ article says that it's
for "elite colleges".  What makes a college "elite"?  _The Times_ says
"roughly 80 of the most selective colleges in the United States, as
measured by a 2009 index created by Barron's".  My first search for
those data yielded [the 2015 list, as reported by the Jack Kent Cooke
Foundation](https://www.jkcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/The_Transfer_Process-2015_list_of_selective_colleges.pdf).  The Cooke foundation refers
to "selectivity"; it looks like "elite" is either "most competitive" (1)
or "highly competitive" (2)

<table class="table">
  <tr> <th>Institution</th> <th>Selectivity</th> <th>US News Rating</th>
  <tr> <td>Amherst</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Bowdoin</td> <td>1</td> <td>5</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Carleton</td> <td>1</td> <td>6</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Colorado</td> <td>1</td> <td>27</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Davidson</td> <td>1</td> <td>10</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Grinnell</td> <td>2</td> <td>11</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Kenyon</td> <td>1</td> <td>30</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Macalester</td> <td>1</td> <td>27</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Oberlin</td> <td>1</td> <td>30</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Pomona</td> <td>1</td> <td>5</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Reed</td> <td>1</td> <td>90 [20]</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Smith</td> <td>1</td> <td>11</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>St. Olaf</td> <td>2</td> <td>61</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Swarthmore</td> <td>1</td> <td>3</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Vassar</td> <td>1</td> <td>11</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Washington and Lee</td> <td>11</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Williams</td> <td>1</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
</table>

Fascinating.  In spite of being less selective than most of these institutions,
we rank better than five of the higher-selectivity institutions.  I wonder
if we are the highest-ranked "selectivity 2" institution.  Let's see.
What are the other top schools on the _US News_ top-twenty list?

<table class="table">
  <tr> <td>Wellesley</td> <td>1</td> <td>3</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Middlebury</td> <td>1</td> <td>5</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Claremont McKenna</td> <td>1</td> <td>9</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Haverford</td> <td>1</td> <td>11</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Colgate</td> <td>1</td> <td>16</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Hamilton</td> <td>1</td> <td>16</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Colby</td> <td>1</td> <td>18</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Harvey Mudd</td> <td>1</td> <td>18</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>United States Military Academy</td> <td>18</td> <td>1</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>Wesleyan (CT)</td> <td>1</td> <td>18</td> </tr>
</table> 

Okay, we're the highest-ranked "selectivity 2" institution in the
top twenty.  How far down do we have to go to reach the next one?
Mount Holyoke, at 30 [21].  After that, it's Lafayette at 36.
Hmmm ... does _US News_ use selectivity?  Their [description of their
methodology](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings)
doesn't suggest that they look at yield, which I assume is a core
aspect of the Barron's study.  Strange.  Ah!  _U.S. News_ indicates that
they've removed it.  But they do write "A school's academic atmosphere
is influenced by the selectivity of its admissions", and they do take
both grades and standardized scores into account.

---

Eventually, I found what seems to be [The _Barrons'_ 2009
list](https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/Selective-Institution-List-Selective-Institution-List.csv.pdf)
which also appears in [_The New York
Times_](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/04/04/business/economy/economix-selectivity-table.html?_r=0).
In the 2009 list, we're a 3.  I see that the 2015 list has collapsed
"highly competitive" (e.g., Grinnell) with "highly competitive plus" (e.g.,
Colorado, in the 2009 list).  I don't think it's worth following up on that;
I wonder why _The Times_ used the 2009 list rather than the 2015 list;
perhaps it's that they had the 2009 data more readily at hand.

---

Am I done?  Well, there's one more table in the  _Times_ article.  It's 
about a statistic that they call "mobility rate", computed as the product
of the percent of students from the bottom two quintiles  times the
success rate at moving them to "the upper-part of the distribution".  Or,
in simpler words, it's the proportion of students at the school who start
in the bottom two quintiles and end up in some undefined "upper part" [22].
Is that a useful statistic?  I'm not sure.

But I do see that it uses very different data.  In that study, only 9.5%
of Grinnell students come from the bottom two quintiles.  Didn't that
earlier study suggest that 14.3% of Grinnell students come from the
bottom two quintiles?  I'm surprised at how much the percents vary from
year to year.  Or maybe the data are wrong.  Who knows?

I am puzzled  at how, for example, the John Jay College of Criminal
Justice can have a "success rate" of 61.1% yet their six-year graduation
rate is only about 45% [23].

In any case, the table suggests that most of these elite schools are
having much less success, at least according to this metric.  But I'm
not sure what we would do about that.  I don't think we should change
our mode of instruction, which remains costly.  But I don't know how
we would make significant changes to our percent of high-need students
without also significantly changing the institution.  Ah, well.  I guess
that's a task for better minds than mine to consider.

Perhaps I'll come back to the original study at some point and see how
they ended up with the data they did.  And perhaps I'll find another
useful metric for assessing the comparative benefit schools like Grinnell
provide.  But that's a task for another day.

---

Hmmm.  The _Times_ article ends with this note.

> Selectivity tiers used here are based on a 2009 index created by _Barron's_. "Ivy plus" colleges include the eight colleges of the Ivy League in addition to Stanford, the University of Chicago, Duke and M.I.T. "Other elite colleges" represent colleges with a selectivity index of 1 excluding the "Ivy plus" colleges. "Highly selective" colleges represent those with a selectivity index of 2; "selective" colleges represent those with a selectivity index from 3 to 5; "nonselective" colleges represent those with a selectivity index greater than 5 or unlisted in Barron's.

So why does Grinnell appear in the table of "elite" colleges?  And why
would someone choose criteria that should not classify all of the _U.S. News_
top twenty as "elite"?  I have no idea.

---

What did I learn from this whole exercise?  Not as much as I had hoped.
I remain proud of my institution.  I seem to have found that we are
doing better than peers in some metrics, but I'm not sure how useful
those metrics are.

In the end, I was reminded that you should not take data at face value.
There's also a lot of variation in these data from year to year.  

At least I had fun looking for data.

[1] Musing coming soon.

[2] I might also muse about this article.  From my perspective, it
falls into the "clueless academic at elite institution" category.
But what do I know?

[3] When last I visited, they seemed to have a very active cadre of
QuestBridge scholars.  But I guess that doesn't have as much of an impact
as I would have imagined.

[4] I wonder if that counts our international students [5].  While
Grinnell has a share of full-pay international students, I also think of
us as making an important difference to international students who are
unlikely to be full pay, some of whom are here on full-ride scholarships.

[5] _The Times_ [6] says that "The researchers tracked about 30 million students born between 1980 and 1991, linking anonymized tax returns to attendance records from nearly every college in the country."  So it sounds like it's only
US students [7].

[6] Should that be "_The Times_" or "The _Times_"?  I've seen both used.

[7] Let's do some WAG [8] estimates.  About 20% of our students can be
classified as "international students".  Let's assume that half of those 
are 1%'ers (probably an excessive estimate) and the rest are bottom
60% (possibly also an excessive estimate).  That would give us about
14.4% in the top 1% and about 29.7% in the bottom 60%, moving our
ratio from 0.22 to 0.48, fairly close to Swarthmore's.  If we assume that
1/4 were 1%'ers and 1/4 were bottom 60%, we'd get 9.4% vs. 24.7%, we
get a ratio of 0.38, somewhere between Mac and Vassar.  Of course, we'd also
need to do the analysis for all of those institutions.  

[8] Wild-Ass Guess

[9] Peer institution list taken from <https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/institutional-research/resources>.

[10] Well, the bottom of our peer group.  I'm pretty sure that there are
a few thousand schools in the list.

[11] At least that's my take from reading _The Privileged Poor_.  Of course,
that book looks at the kind of wealth that you see at places like Amherst
and Harvard [12].

[12] I was surprised to see that Harvard has both a smaller percentage from
the top 1% (15.1%) and from the bottom 60% (20.4%) than Amherst.

[14] And yes, it's important to grow the endowment.  Ours may be huge, but
it's that huge endowment that allows us to simultaneously provide a high-end
undergraduate education while remaining need-blind in admissions and
meeting full demonstrated financial need [15].

[15] Yes, I realize that "full demonstrated financial need" is a complicated
proposition and that most students do not feel like we do enough.

[16] I realize that networking is easier for those with higher social
capital.  I also learned in _The Privileged Poor_ that low-SES students
are often raised to "do it on your own" rather than to take advantage
of networking.  Nonetheless, students benefit from the opportunity
to network with those who have family who might offer you internships
and connections.

[17] I'm not saying that it's fair.  I'm just acknowledging that it
happens.

[18] "The _Times_ article" seems correct, and better than "The _The Times_
article".

[19] No, I don't understand why Grinnell and Smith have the same ranking but
different percentages, while St. Olaf and Oberlin have the same percentage but 
different rankings.

[20] A [recent study](https://www.reed.edu/reed-magazine/articles/2019/usnews-discrepancy.html) suggests that Reed belongs at #36 and that _US News_ is
punishing them for not participating in the study.

[21] Soka is ranked 22 but is not on the list of Barron's selectivity
ratings that I found.

[22] Upon further inspection, I see that the table legend says "Success
rate measures the percent of lower-income students who ended up in the
top 40 percent."

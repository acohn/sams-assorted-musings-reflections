Conference side trips
=====================

In [a musing about graduation](more-scenes-from-graduation-2017), I mentioned
that I had brought a student to a Jonathan Richman concert.  A reader asked
for the backstory.  It's not that complicated, but I think it says something
interesting or useful.

It's not that complicated a story. I had driven a bunch of students to a
conference in Kansas City. I tend to skim the concert listings when I'm
at a conference; I don't usually have time, but sometimes I do. Anyway,
Jonathan Richman, who is one of my favorite artists, was playing at a
local club. I offered to treat any students who wanted to go. One said
"Oh, my parents love Jonathan. I'll go." I couldn't convince anyone
else. But we had a great night.

I also try to make it to the art museum in cities with conferences. I'm
usually more successful at that. (And yes, I did bring students to an
art museum in Kansas City, too. I got more takers for that.)

Kansas City was great, in part because I had a car with me.  I also
escaped to a really nice Half-Price books.

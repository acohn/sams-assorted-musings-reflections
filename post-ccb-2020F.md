Today the Cut/Close/Balance process for Fall 2020 finished.  As
I've mentioned previously, the whole process seemed pointless to
me.  We know that, no matter what model Grinnell chooses for the
fall, things will change.  Why put faculty and staff through the
work of figuring out the cuts and balances?  Why give students the
negative experience of being cut or changed?  We were told that we
had to go through the process to understand student demand.  But
my sense was that the original "preliminary registration" shows
demand better.  After students are cut from, say, SMS-195, it's no
longer as obvious that 58 students had signed up for the course.
And maybe one of the fall models would permit that (most likely
through multiple sections).

I'm not sure how to order my thoughts, or even what to look for. 
But let's see what I can figure out.  I should explore cuts, 
closes, and balances, although not necessarily in that order.

For those who are new to the whole process, after the CCB process,
courses are marked as "Open", "Balanced", "Closed", or "Canceled".
Students can register for "Open" courses without instructor permission.
Students can enroll for "Balanced" and "Closed" courses only with
instructor permission.  Those that are closed and full generally
will not allow students to join.  Those that are closed and not
full are often leaving spaces for incoming first-year students.
100-level classes that are balanced are also usually leaving spaces
for incoming first-year students.  Polite requests sometimes work,
but not always.  Demands rarely work.

Follow-up: I wrote about some cuts, some balances, some over-enrollments,
some closes, some expansions, maybe something else.  I was probably not
consistent.  For example, a course that over-enrolled by one or two
students probably ended up in "closes" while on that overenrolled by
three or four ended up in "over-enrollments".  

I ran out of energy at Environmental Studies.  A bit later, I found
energy to push through.  I'm not sure I caught everything.  I'm not
sure I care.  Maybe some semester, I'll remember to start at the
end of the alphabet, rather than the front.  Or maybe I'll find a
better way to work through all the data.

**_Some Cuts_**

It's hard to tell retrospectively which courses have cuts.  Generally,
cuts show up as closed courses with no openings, but not always.  Having
an earlier version of the enrollments helps, but it's a lot of work
to compare [1].  

* It looks like six (6) students got cut from ANT-225-01, _Bio-determinsm
  & Myth of Race_ [2]
* I can't quite tell what happened to ART-111, _Introduction to the
  Studio_.  It was over-enrolled [3].  Now there are nine slots
  available, including four in section four, which had been
  over-enrolled by seventeen students.  Puzzling.  The other sections
  appear to have been balanced, although they are now marked as
  "Closed".  It's nice to know that there are a few slots open for
  incoming first-year students.
* ART-134, _Drawing_, seems to be in a similar state.  It was slightly
  over-enrolled.  I had assumed it would be balanced, but seven students
  were cut from section 2 and none seem to have been moved to section 1.
  So some slots remain, either for those who beg to be added or for
  first-years.
* ART-195-01, _ST: Intro to Film Studies_, cut three students.  It is
  now at capacity.
* It appears that ART-238-01, _Painting_, cut one student.  I hate having
  to do cuts like that.  You choose your course capacity for a reason,
  but it sucks to have to decide to cut when you are cutting only one 
  or two students [4].
* Wow!  Ten students seem to have been cut from BCM-262-01, _Introduction
  to Biological Chemistry_.  Is that what Biological Chemistry normally
  does?  I'm not sure.
* BIO-240-01, _Animal Behavior w/lab_, cut eleven students.
* BIO-325-01, _Fungal Biology w/lab_, seems to have cut two students,
  remaining over-enrolled by two.  I don't quite know how that happens.
* BIO-380-01, _Molecular Biology w/lab_, seems to have cut thirteen
  students.  I wonder where they go.  And I feel really bad for the
  chair in Biology, who clearly had to do lots of shifting.  (See notes
  below.)
* CHM-363-01, _Physical Chemistry I w/lab_, cut seven students.  I wonder
  how they decide who to cut.  All third-years, perhaps?
* CLS/HIS-258-01, _The Roman Empire_, cut twenty students.  Monessa must be
  accustomed to cutting.  I wonder what her strategies are.
* CSC-301-01, _Analysis of Algorithms_, cut twenty-one students.  Many
  got moved to CSC-341 (more on that later).  
* CSC-324-01, _Software Design & Dev w/Lab_, cut three students.  I think
  some voluntarily left.  We may have balanced it, too.  At least it looks
  balanced.
* ECN-282, _Macroeconomic Analysis (aka macro), cut five students and
  balanced the two sections.  I wonder how they decided who to cut.
  We likely would have looked at students who had two courses in the
  department, or students who could be moved to another course (e.g.,
  the one slot in micro).
* ECN-286, _Econometrics_ (aka 'metrics), cut six students.  More on 
  _Econometrics_ below.
* Twenty-eight students were cut from ENG-205, _The Craft of Fiction_.
  I don't know how we can better adjust for the demand on that class.
  Maybe have English faculty teach fewer Tutorials?
* About thirty-seven students were cut from ENV-261, _Climate Chng, Devel,
  & Envrnmt_.  I'm not sure how that course got cut to one below
  capacity.  I thought that wasn't permitted.  (I know when we've
  asked to do that so that there's a bit of slack [6] to allow
  students to petition to get back in, and were not permitted [8]
  to do so.)
* HIS-261-01, _Mod Africa: Sahara to Zambezi_, cut six students.
* MAT-316-01, _Foundations of Analysis_, cut three students.  I wonder
  who those students are and where they go.  I'd expect it's non-majors,
  but I'm not sure.
* POL-237-01, _Political Parties_, cut four students.  There are open
  slots in other political science courses, including some that meet at the
  same time, so I expect there's a hope that students will switch.  But
  I wonder how Political Science decides who to cut.
* POL-251-01, _Internatl Political Economy_, cut five students.  See prior
  reflection.
* POL-352-01, _US Forgn Policymaking Process_, cut five students.  It's
  still over-enrolled by three.
* PSY-246-01, _Brain and Behavior_, cut seven students.  I wonder if those
  students will switch to the other 200-level Psych courses that are open,
  or were they taking it primarily for a neuroscience concentration?
* SMS-195-01, _Intro Sci, Med, Tech_, cut thirty-one students to get
  to a state in which it is now over-enrolled  by only two.  In a normal
  year, I would hope that we would have found a way to add another section.
  I wonder if I'll end up with some of the SMS students in my TEC-154
  course in the spring [9].
* SOC-230-01, _Mass Media and Society_, cut twenty-five students, leaving
  the course over-enrolled by three.  I wonder if it's easier to cut that
  many students?  (In CS, it's hard, becacuse we want to make sure that
  they have another place to go.  That involves work by the Registrar's
  office, by advisors, and by the department chair.)
* SOC-240-01, _Social Movements_, cut four students.
* SOC-360-01, _Work in the "New" Economy_, cut nine students.  I expect
  that was a lot of work [10].
* Only four (4) students were cut from STA-310, _Statistical Modeling_.
  I wonder if they have models that determine who to cut.

Yeah, that's probably enough cuts to consider.

**_Some Balances_**

Balances happen most frequently when there are multiple sections
of a course with differing enrollments.  In CS, we balance courses
primarily to give students better experiences or at least more
equivalent experiences.  You get more attention in a class of fifteen
than one of twenty-five.  Two classes of twenty are fairer.  Balancing
can also help make slots available for students who need to add
courses late, for students returning from leave, and for first-year
students and transfers.  I'm also focusing primarily on the balances
I can see.  I know that CS "balanced" students from CSC-301 to
CSC-341, in part to prevent over-enrollment in the spring CSC-341.
Those kinds of things are hard to see.

* It looks like the four sections of BIO-251, _Molcls, Cells, &
  Orgnsm w/lab_ were balanced, but the result seems strange.  Section
  one has three slots available.  Section two is over-enrolled by
  eleven students.  That's better than the forty before, but it's
  still a lot.  Section three has one slot.  Section four has
  three slots.  I assume no more balancing could happen.
* It looks like the four sections of CHM-221, _Organic Chemistry
  I w/lab_, were balanced.  As I predicted [11], they don't seem
  to have cut any students, which means that the sections are all
  over-enrolled by an average of five students [12].  The labs seem
  almost perfectly balanced.  Thirty-five had to be moved from
  one section.  I feel sorry for the Registrar's staff who likely
  had to do the moving.
* The two sections of CSC-207, _OO Prob Slvg, Data Struc/Alg_ were
  balanced, with both now exactly at capacity.  I'm still puzzled 
  why the afternoon section had such high enrollment, particularly
  given that the two sections have the same instructor.
* The two sections of CSC-211, _Comp Org/Architecture w/lab_ were
  almost balanced.  It looks like we wanted to switch one more to
  the morning section, but the rest of the students had conflicts.
* The two sections of MAT/STA-335, _Probability & Statistics I_, were
  balanced.
* The two sections of _NRS-495_, Neuroscience Seminar, were balanced.
* PHY-232 may be the one course in which the course didn't need
  balancing, but the three labs did.
* The two sections of PHI-102, _Symbolic Logic_ were balanced, as were
  the two sections of PHI-111, _Introduction to Philosophy_.  If I 
  were more clever, I would find a way to make a joke about philosophy
  and balance.
* The four sections of STA-209, _Applied Statistics_, were balanced.
  There are five slots left.

Then there are the 100-level courses, which have some slots for intro
students.

* ECN-111, _Introduction to Economics_, is listed as "balanced",
  with sixty (60) slots available.  Interestingly, the most popular
  section seems to have been cancelled, probably to free that faculty
  member to teach another course.
* The two sections of JPN-101, _Beginning Japanese I_, were balanced,
  leaving eleven (11) and twelve (12) slots open for first-year students.
* The three sections of PHY-131, _General Physics I w/lab_, were balanced,
  leaving twenty-four (24) slots open for first-year students.  The labs
  were also balanced.  
* Three of the four sections of POL-101, _Intro to Political Science_,
  were balanced.  One is still open.  (The 8:00 a.m. slot, of course.)
  Seventy (70) slots are available for first-years.

**_Some Over-Enrollments_** 

A variety of courses remain over-enrolled, some significantly.

* As I mentioned earlier, section 2 of BIO-251 is over-enrolled by
  eleven students.  I don't know how that works, since the course
  has an integrated lab and our lab spaces only hold twenty-four
  students [14]
* I see that Katya did not cut any students from AMS/ANT-305-01,
  _Cultural Politics of Fashion_, keeping twenty-one students in
  an upper-level course intended for fifteen.
* Whoever is teaching ARH-195-01, _Innovations in Art Market_ was
  generous, it had been over-enrolled by fourteen; it's still
  over-enrolled by eight.  I wonder what the course will look like
  without what I recall being a travel component.
* BIO-365, _Microbiology w/lab_ is significantly overenrolled, with
  twenty-four students in a course intended for twelve.  There were
  twenty-five students.  I hope one voluntarily switched out.  I
  worry about the twenty-four.  I see that they ended up separating
  out the lab and adding another lab section.  That helps compensate
  for the extra burden on the faculty member, but not a lot.  
* Something similar happend with BIO-380, _Molecular Biology w/lab_.
  It had been over-enrolled by nineteen students.  Now it's over-enrolled
  by six, with two labs (one with ten people, one with eight).  
* CSC-161-01, _Imperative Prob Solving w/lab_, remains over-enrolled
  by five students.  Henry Walker is "old school".  He won't cut students
  if there's room in the classroom.  I'm not sure that's good for long-term
  faculty health.
* ENG-227-01, _American Lit Traditions I_ [15], is over-enrolled by four
  students.  And that's after cutting three students.  I feel sorry
  for Steve, who is teaching twenty-nine students in a 200-level
  English class.  That seems like way too many.
* I'm even more worried for Steve because he also has twenty-one students
  in ENG-330, _Studies in American Prose I_, which should only have
  fifteen.  One over-enrolled course is hard.  Two over-enrolled courses
  are ....
* FRN-313-01, _Intro French Lit/19 & 20 Cent_, is over-enrolled by a 
  whopping eleven (11) students.  How do you teach a 300-level French
  seminar with twenty-six (26) students?
* HIS-223-01, _Hlth & Medicine American Hist_, is over-enrolled by
  seven (7) students, making it a 200-level history course with thirty-two
  (32) students.  Too many!  What's a nice way to say "Don't be me" to
  a colleague?
* PHY-335, _Electromagnetic Theory_, is over-enrolled by six students,
  with twenty-four rather than eighteen.
* POL/PST-220, _Foundations of Policy Analysis_, is over-enrolled
  by four (4) students.  It looks like Doug didn't cut anyone.  (I
  almost thought that Doug had two courses that were over-enrolled
  by four students.)
* PSY-250-01, _Health Psychology_, is over-enrolled by three (3) students.
* PSY-349-01, _Counseling Psychology w/lab_, is over-enrolled by five
  (5) students.  It feels like twenty students in an upper-level course
  on counseling will be very different than fifteen.
* SPN-395-01, _ST: Caravans, Gangs, Drugs_, is over-enrolled by 
  four (4) students.

I worry about these over-enrolled courses.  We choose caps for a reason.
Larger classes are not necessarily good for the students, and they represent
extra work for the faculty members.  At some point, the institution needs
to think more carefully about how to deal with these kinds of courses.
If it's once in a while, it's not an issue.  If it's regular, then something
needs to be considered.  I expect this kind of planning is a few years
down the road, in the post-pandemic days.

**_Some Closes_**

We should also look at some courses that were closed.  (More precisely,
some *other* courses, since over-enrolled courses are closed, as are
cut classes.)

It looks like a lot of introductory courses were closed rather than
balanced.  The five sections of ANT-104, _Anthropological Inquiries_,
have about eighty-nine (89) slots available.  I see that they did
not attempt to balance the sections.  The four sections of BIO-150,
_Intro to Biolgcl Inqry w/lab_, are closed with seventy-two (72)
slots available.  The three sections of CHM-129, _General Chemistry
w/lab_, have fifty-one (51) slots available.  The three sections
of CSC-151, Functional Prob Solving w/lab_, have forty-one (41)
slots available [16].  The two sections of EDU-101, _Education
Princ/Plural Society_, have five (5) open slots.  It does not look like
any attempt was made to balance them.  ENG-120, _Literary Analysis_,
has twenty-eight (28) slots available.  ENV/SCI-125-01, _Intro to Earth Syst
Sci w/lab_, has five (5) slots available.  GWS-111, _Intro Gndr, Wmn's
& Sxlty Stud_, has fifty-three (53) slots available.  I'm surprised that
they did not balance the sections; one has six (6) slots, one has nine (9),
two have nineteen (19) each.  HIS-100-03 is closed, with sixteen (16) slots
available.  There are sixty-eight (68) additional slots in the other
three sections, which are not closed.  LIN-114, _Intro to General
Linguistics_, has fifteen (15) slots available.  Third-years and seniors
are not allowed to preregister for LIN-114.  I wonder if they will
allow other students into the course.  MAT-123, _Functions &
Differential Calc_, is closed with twenty-nine (29) slots available.
MAT-131, _Calculus I_, is closed with about 113 slots available.
Is that about the normal state?  MAT-133, _Calculus II_ [17] has
about 103 slots available, if I count correctly.  MUS-100, _Introduction
to Music Studies_, has eleven (11) slots available.  PHY-116, _Universe
& Its Structure_, has eleven slots available.  PSY-113,
_Intro to Psychology w/lab_, has fifty-six (56) slots available.

There are also a few others not at the introductory level.  I probably 
missed many of them.  These are some I thought were interesting, for wahtever
reason.

* ECN-372-01, _Sem Economic Development_, and ECN-374-01, _Sem International
  Trade_, are closed/full.
* EDU-301-01, _Teaching & Tutoring Writing_, is closed.  I wonder what
  happens if Tisha needs more writing mentors?
* ENG-314-01, _Milton_, is closed, over-enrolled by one.  Who knew that
  Milton was so popular?
* GLS/JPN-195-01, _ST: Japanese Science Fiction_, is closed, over-enrolled
  by one.  
* JPN-331-01, _Advanced Japanese I_, is closed.  I wonder what happens if
  one or two other students ask to enroll.
* MATH-321-01, _Foundations of Abstract Albegra_, is closed with one extra
  student.  Math is pretty full at the 300-level.
* MUS-201-01, _Music, Mind, & Brain_, is closed at exactly twenty.
* PHE-235-01, _Psych Foundations of Sport_, is also closed at exactly
  twenty.  No need for cuts!
* PHY-462-01, _Advanced Laboratory_ [18], is over-enrolled by one.  Sometimes
  it's easier to keep that one extra student than to cut one.
* POL-255-01, _Politics of the New Europe_, is closed with twenty-five
  students.  Another one of those magic cases in which exactly the right
  number of students enrolled.
* REL-211-01, _The Hebrew Bible_, is at exactly twenty.  No cuts
  necessary!  Divine intervention?
* REL-295-01, _ST: Religion and Food_, is also at exactly twenty with
  no cuts necessary.  Dietary intervention?
* SPN-320-01, _Cult of Spanish Speaking World_, is closed, over-enrolled
  by one.

A bunch of PE courses are closed, some over-enrolled.  I'm just going
to list their names, not their enrollments.
PHE-100-18, _Beginning Racqueball_.
PHE-100-19B, _Rock Climbing_ (19A is open).
PHE-100-36B, _Indoor Cycling Plus Core_ (there is no 36A).
PHE_100-46, _Mindfulness and Yoga_ (the Dean did say that flexibility
is core in the coming year).
PHE-100-47, _Fishing_ (I didn't know we had fishing).
PHE-100-48, _Yoga I_ (see my comment about the Dean).

**_Some Additions_**

At times, we handle over-enrollments by cutting a course in one place and
adding one in another. 

* Remember that cut section of Intro Econ?  That freed up a faculty member
  to teach a second section.
* We seem to have added a second section of _Introduction to Shakespeare_.
  Both are over-enrolled, with twenty-five students instead of
  twenty.  That's great (except for the extra work on the faculty);
  Shakespeare can be an important part of a liberal education.  I
  don't know Sherif Abdelkarim well; I wonder what it will feel
  like to be teaching a course that some students take, in part,
  because of the instructor's reputation.  I wonder what it will feel
  like to miss teaching the seminar on Medieval Lit.
* We now have two sections of MAT-317, a seminar, which previously had
  twenty-four (24) students and now has two sections of twelve.  I'm
  puzzled that the two sections have different names.  One is _Numeical
  Analysis_ and the other is _Advanced Topics in Analysis_.  How did they
  decide who got which sections?  I see that they freed up a faculty
  member to teach this by cutting a section of Calc II.
* A section of PHY-132, _General Physics II w/lab_ was added (at
  the same time as the other section; do we have two labs for
  workshop Physics?)   But that means that we've lost the wonderful
  _Bridges, Towers, and Skyscrapers_.  So sad.
* SPN-312, _Women & Gender in Spanish Lit_, got split into two sections.
  It looks like the split did not go as well as one would help.  One 
  section has nineteen, one has eight.

**_Some Comments_**

A few assorted other comments.

* I'm sad that ENG/GLS-349-01, _Medieval Literature_, was cut.  That
  seems like an important course.
* I'm not sure why GDS/POL-395-01, _ST: Ggrphs Bottom Billion_, was
  not cut.  300-level special-topics courses with one student aren't
  usually permitted.  There are a few other 200- and 300-level
  courses with fewer than the traditional minimum of six.  I wonder
  how much time the Dean had this year to probe for courses to cut
  and to negotiate about those cuts.  Since it has only happened
  to CS once in memory [19], I don't know how all that happens.
* I don't understand what's happening with HIS-100.  One section
  is closed, with sixteen slots open.  The other three sections are
  open (they do have more slots available).
* It's rare that there are slots left in MAT-115, _Linear Algebra_,
  and a section of MAT-218, _Topics in Discrete Mathematics_.  But
  there are this fall.  Cool!  (It's not like there are a lot, but
  there are a few, which allows people to shift a bit.)
* I find it interesting to see which 100-level courses get balanced,
  which just get closed, and which are left open.  I didn't try to
  catch all of the 100-level open courses, but they include 
  ARH-103, _Intro to Art History_ (31 slots),
  CHI-101, _Beginning Chinese I_ (24 slots),
  REL-101, _Stdying Rel: Judaism & Chrstnty_ (25 slots), 
  REL-103, _Stdying Religion: Middle East_ (24 slots),
  RUS-101, _Beginning Russian I_ (8 slots),
  SOC-111, _Introduction to Sociology_ (83 slots),
  SPN-105, _Introduction Spanish Lang I_ (32 slots),
  and many others.

[1] Okay, it's not that much work.  And I could probably write a program
to do it.  But I don't feel like programming.

[2] I'm just using the title from the online schedule.  I'm sure it
was spelled out in the original title.

[3] Although not as much as in past semesters.

[4] It sucks even more to be that student [5].

[5] It also sucks to be that student's advisor, who provides support and
who helps them find an alternative.

[6] No, not microsoft teams [7].

[7] That was intended as a joke.  Don't worry if you didn't get it.

[8] I realize the repetition of "permit" is annoying.  I am not feeling 
up to coming up with a better word.

[9] That assumes that I will still teach TEC-154 in the spring.  It
feels like many things are left up in the air right now.

[10] Ha ha.

[11] Or as I recall predicting.

[12] Should I have put the course in the "over-enrolled" category?

[14] Will they even hold 24 as we institute social distancing in lab?
That's a question for another day (and another person).

[15] Why "Lit Traditions" rather than "Literary Trads" or even "Lit Trads"?

[16] For once, we did not balance the three sections.  The enrollments
were not different enough to warrant disrupting students.

[17] I do not know why Calculus II is not numbered as MAT-132.

[18] I always thought it was "Ad Lab", or perhaps "Add Lab".

[19] A long time ago, back when we were on the second floor.  It was
not a good decision; it caused hard feelings for years to follow.

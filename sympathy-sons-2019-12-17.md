Sympathy for my sons
====================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

_Setting: Last night.  The Rebelsky living room.  Son is sitting on 
the purple sofa [1], watching TV.  Father [2] is working [3] on his
computer._

**Father**: What are you watching?

**Son**: A movie.

_Father watches for a few minutes._

**Father**: Is this that TV show with the guy who can't die?

**Son**: No, it's a movie.

_Father watches for a few minutes.  We've transitioned to a car
chase through the streets of Italy.  Our heroes [4] are driving a
very fast lime green sports car.  Every so often, the screen pauses
and it says something like "Number 1: The Driver" or "Number 6: The
Millionaire."_

**Father**: Is this one of those _Fast and Furious_ movies?

**Son**: No.  It's a Netflix movie called _6 Underground_.

_Father goes back to work, with the TV in the background._

**Father**: What's this called again?

**Son**: _6 Underground_.

_Father then goes to the other room to work [5].  Eventually,
Father returns to the living room.  Father has forgotten the
ame of the movie, but recalls that one of the characters identified
the heroes as "ghosts"._

**Father**: Are you enjoying _Ghosts_?

**Son**: It's called _6 Underground_.  It's okay.

_Father goes to bed.  The next day, the conversation continues._

**Father**: How was _Six Under_?

**Son**: _6 Underground_.

Did you ever feel like you'd become part of an Internet meme?

And don't you feel sympathy for my sons?

---

Postscript: While only one son participated in this conversation, I'm
pretty sure that all of my sons have had experiences like this.

---

[1] Or maybe it's a chaise lounge.  I can never tell.

[2] That's me.

[3] Hypothetically.

[4] I think.

[5] Or maybe to try to watch a basketball game.

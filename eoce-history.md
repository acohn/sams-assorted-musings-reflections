A brief history of Grinnell's end-of-course evaluations
=======================================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), assessment, Grinnell*

Proposal was first presented in March 15, 1999 faculty meeting.  That was to set up the new system and experiment with it, with another followup in 1999-2000.  Lee suggested that we have students add a short, narrative answer.  (Wow, lee was already an Associate Professor in 1999.)

It looks like the next proposal from Elizabeth Dobbs was November 1, 1999.  That proposal was for another study, to be reviewed in 2000-2001.

November 20, 2000.  Bill Ferguson led us in a discussion.

December 4, 2000.  Continued discussion.  Voted.  Here's the important text, taken from a November 16, 2000 memo from EC that was approved by the faculty.

"In the event of a review, department chairs and the Personnel Committee will receive summaries of the quantitative data (see attached sample).  Chairs should not attempt to summarize the entire body of text comments, but it is permissible to use text comments from student evaluations to clarify and interpret the numeric data."

September 17, 2007.  Eliza reviewed our suggested changes with the faculty.

October 1 2007.  Motion passed.

The Budget Committee for the faculty may receive the total number of responses and proportion of those responses in the agree and strongly agree categories for questions #2 and #6 on the end-of-course evaluations for each course taught by faculty members under review. For comparative purposes, the Budget Committee may receive appropriate aggregate data for the faculty as a whole.

What does that all mean?  There are limits on what different committees can get.
Personnel can get scores and only the text that faculty or their review chairs
choose to release.  Budget committee can get summary info on categories 2 and 6
and *should* get comparative data.

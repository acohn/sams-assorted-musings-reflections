More yammering
==============

You may recall my [recent rant about students on Yammer](yammering).
Today, I received a notice that I had a backlog of about a dozen 
messages on All Company.  Here's the start of one of them [1].

> Week 5: (Way past week 5 but I'll post anyways) I got a pretty bad
score but I don't think I'm as bad as the quiz told me I am. I think
that appropriate professional manners can only be..

I'm pretty sure that we expect our students to at least think about
professional behavior.  But here we have a student announcing to campus
that (a) they do not do work in a timely fashion, (b) they did well on
whatever the quiz was, and (c) they have a view on professional manners
that does not match what others seem to think.  As I wrote to our
office of Careers, Life, and Service, such a posting reflects poorly
not only on the student, but also on CLS and the College as a whole.

Fortunately, the student (or someone in CLS) has realized that they
should delete the post.  But still ....

Of course, this rant is equally unprofessional.

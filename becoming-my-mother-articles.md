"I thought you might like this"
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

When Michelle and I started dating, one of the first questions she asked
was, "Why do you have so many unopened letters from your mother?" [1].
So I told her to open one of them.  Inside was a folded article from
somewhere or other [2] along with a sticky note that said something like
"Thought you might like this."  When Michelle opened the rest, she found
that they also contained articles.  So, they weren't so much "letters from
my mother" as "recommended readings from my mother".

Now, mom was right.  In most cases, I appreciated reading the articles.
I still have a few stashes of them scattered throughout my offices [3].
But I found them most natural to read in batches, rather than as they
arrived.  Sorry, mom!

The other day, I reflected on my own behavior.  If I recall correctly,
I had texted a link to an article from _The Washington Post_ to one of my
sons, along with a note that "I thought you might like this" [4].  I had
emailed a group of friends [5] with a link to an article in _Chronicle_
along with a slightly longer note: "You may have seen this already.
I'm passing it along in case you haven't because I think you'll find
it useful."  They hadn't.  They did [6].  And a day later, I sent another
son an article on the history of `vi` [7].  

And then it sunk in ... In this way, as in so many others, I've clearly
become my mother.

Postscript: I realize that it's common to share articles on, say,
Facebook.  But that's generally sharing with the world.  I'm sending
texts and emails to a few people, often my family.  That feels different.
Or perhaps it's just that large numbers of people are becoming more like
my mother.

[1] "I'm a bad son" was not the correct answer.

[2] _The New York Times_, _The New Yorker_, _Psychology Today_, _The
Boston Globe_, and many other places.

[3] I have no idea where in particular they are, but they turn up from
time to time and make me happy.

[4] He did.  He ended up quoting parts of it back to us.

[5] Also colleagues.

[6] More accurately, two of the four colleagues wrote back.  Neither had
seen it.  Both thanked me for sending it along.  50% is a pretty good hit
rate.

[7] That was less successful. He asked me, "Why did you send this?"

"I thought you might like this"
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

When Michelle first met me, one of the questions she asked was "Why do
you have so many unopened letters from you mother?" [1].  So I told her
to open up one of them.  Inside was a folded article from somewhere or
other [2] along with a sticky note that said something like "Thought you
might like this."  When Michelle opened the rest, she found that they also
contained articles.  

Now, mom was right.  In most cases, I appreciated reading the articles.
I still have a few stashes of them scattered throughout my offices [3].
But I found them easiest to read in batches, rather than as they arrived.
Sorry mom!

The other day, I reflected on the fact that I was texting my son a link
to an article from _The Washington Post_ to one of my sons, along with a
note that "I thought you might like this" [4].  Then I noted that I was
emailing a group of friends [5] with a link to an article in _Chronicle_
along with a slightly longer note: "You may have seen this already.  I'm
passing it along in case you haven't because I think you'll find it useful."
They hadn't.  They did [6].

And then it sunk in ... In this way, as in so many others, I'm clearly
becoming my mother.

[1] "I'm a bad son" is not the correct answer.

[2] _The New York Times_, _The New Yorker_, _Psychology Today_, _The
Boston Globe_, and many other places.

[3] I have no idea where in particular they are, but they turn up from
time to time and make me happy.

[4] He did.  He ended up quoting parts of it back to us.

[5] Also colleagues.

[6] More accurately, two of the four colleagues wrote back.  Neither had
seen it.  Both thanked me for sending it along.  50% is a pretty good hit
rate.

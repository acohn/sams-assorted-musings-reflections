Grinnell's new banners
======================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), marketing, rambly*

Communications recently decided to fill the light posts on campus
with multi-colored banners with two-word phrases [1].  Some of them
appear individually, some paired with another.  I've mentioned a
few of them in earlier posts, such as [one in which I comment on
language](language-2018-05-02).  Quick snapshots of the banners have
also appeared on my Facebook feed, particularly as I get irritated by
the different ones.

What do they say?  Here are some.

* "**Learn Grinnellian**".  I don't know what this means.  The best suggestions
  are "It's missing the vocative comma and should read 'Learn, Grinnellian'"
  and "Grinnellian is clearly serving as an adverb; it's like Gangnam
  style" [2].
* "**Live Grinnellian**".  In this case, "Grinnellian" is clearly serving as
  an adverb.  Well, I guess there's a chance that "Grinnellian" is a noun
  and "Live" is an adjective, as in "Live Nude Grinnellians", or some such.
* "**Go Forth Grinnellian**".  Another case in which the [vocative
  comma](http://comma.guide/vocative-comma/) seems to be missing.
  Or perhaps another use of "Grinnellian" as an adverb.
* "**Give Thought**" and "**Take Action**".  An interesting pairing.  These
  are both activities that I hope Grinnellians engage in [3].  I must
  admit that I find "give thought" wordy.  Isn't that just "think"?  
  Or perhaps it is intended to mean "give your thoughts to others".
  I understand that the pair is supposed to be clever and ironic.  But,
  well, that's the level of cleverness that is typical in the musings,
  which is to say it is insufficient for the level of writing we expect
  of most Grinnell students.
* "**Seek Meaning**" and "**Spread Kindness**".  I can't dispute those two.
  However, I don't see a natural pairing to these two.  I did, however,
  hear one person say "Spread butter.  Be Kind."
* "**Cross Disciplines**" and "**Build Bridges**".  Are these intended to say
  the same thing?  I'm not sure.  We don't have engineering on campus
  [5], so "Build Bridges" must be intended as metaphorical, except for
  the few students who build marshmallow and toothpick bridges in some
  sections of "Bridges, Towers, and Skyscrapers" or "The Evolution of
  Technology" [7].
* "**Envision Progress**" and "**Take Action**".  We clearly like "Take Action";
  we pair it with multiple things.  I find this pairing better than the
  previous one.  Since I've just mentioned "The Evolution of Technology",
  I guess I should challenge "Progress".  To many, "Progress" goes with
  some form of technological determinism".  And that's not always good.
  I'll assume that the writers intended progressive progress, which is
  worth taking action for [8].
* "**Honor Experience**" and "**Challenge Assumptions**".  A strange pairing.
  I'd think we'd find something closer to our current slogan, which
  goes something like "Grinnellians ask hard questions and question
  easy answers".  So how about "Ask Questions" and "Question Answers".
  Maybe I missed those two.
* "**Explore Theories**" and "**Share Knowledge**".  Would "Learn" and "Teach"
  be better?  I realize that they are one-word banners, rather than two.
  But part of my subconscious finds the one-word phrases more powerful.
  Come to think of it, one-word phrases might work for many of the
  cases: "Explore", "Share", "Teach", "Learn", "Live", "Seek", "Build",
  "Challenge", "Honor", "Give", "Envision", "Study", "Thrive", "Discover",
  and so on and so forth.  "Take" wouldn't work so well, but most of the 
  rest would.  ANd we could add other words, too.  "Decide".  "Choose".
  "Accept".
* "**Meet the World**" and "**Discover Yourself**".  Another one of those
  clever pairings.  I'm not thrilled with the ways in which the first
  one breaks the two-word form.  Couldn't we have come up with something
  better?  Let's see ... "Encounter Difference" or "Meet Others" come
  to mind, but neither gets the global perspective right.
* "**Study Everywhere**" and "**Thrive Anywhere**".  Do I like the intentional
  pairs?  I can't tell.  I see that we've switched from "verb + object"
  form to "verb + adverb" form.  I'll just keep telling myself that
  foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds [9].
* "**Think Critically**".  It's nice that this banner gets a sign to
  itself [10].  Unfortunately, the shade of green they chose does not go well
  with the nearby foliage.  Is that critical enough?
* "**Scrutinize the Past**" and "**Visualize the Future**".  Back to
  verb/object pairings, but with an extra article.  How about
  "Scrutinize History" and "Visualize Possibilities"?
* "**Live Vocally**" (paired with something else).  I'm surprised we 
  haven't removed these ableist banners.
* "**Think Critically**" and "**Live Locally**".  The latter is clearly a
  better alternative to "Live Vocally".  I'm not sure that there's
  any other sense to the pairing.  The clear pairings in other cases
  make me search for correspondences in pairings like this one.  But
  I failed.
* "**Demand Clarity**" and "**Navigate Ambiguity**".  I appreciate that the
  ambiguous one is hung upside-down, at least from one side [11].
  My more attentive colleagues say things like "Clear expression of
  ambiguity is a decent summary of what I'm (often) trying to teach"
  and "Clearer expressions regarding uncertainty yield vastly improved
  analytical writing" [12].

There's also a "**Live Locally**" and "**_Something_ Globally**" pairing
whose details I've forgotten.  I've probably missed a few others.
But this should be enough to give you a sense.

I've heard folks proposed a number of alternatives.

* "**Advertise incessantly**".
* "**Pair words**".
* "**Think ahead**".  This one is a commentary on the typesetting of the
  banners, where words often push to the end of the borders [14].
* "**Demand Quality**".  You can imagine the sarcastic comments that
  accompanied this one, particularly given the odd printing
* "**Embrace Ridicule**".
* "**Pilot-Test Ideas**".  This one verges into the three-word model.
* "**Bleed Text**".  Can you tell that my readers don't like the 
  way the text is placed?
* "**Overthink Everything**".  I'm pretty sure this was a comment on the
  comments people were giving.
* "**Consult Expensively**".  I've been told that this is President Kington's
  motto.
* "**LARP Grinnellian**".  We have Dag, HvZ, a community of Vampires that
  hasn't been seen since the late 1990's [15], and more.
* "**Don't Panic**".  Wait.  That comes from somewhere else.  Where is that
  towel when I need it?
* "**Park Legally**".
* "**Think Different**".  Or is that "Think Differently".  In either case,
  Apple likely owns a trademark on it.
* "**Write Clearly**" or "**Express Clearly**".  If we had only one banner
  on campus, this should be it.  "**Accept Difference**", or some other
  statement about inclusion, is the other I'd make core.
* "**Confuse Others**".  

So, how do I feel about the banners?  My first response was frustration.
I don't like many of the phrases and find a few offensive.  They generally
strike me as shallow.  I worry that none of them seem to address issues of
inclusion and diversity.  We may not do either as well as we should, but
they are core to our values.  

As someone who spends too much time fighting hobgoblins, I am bothered
by the inconsistency: some have two words, some have three; some are
verb+object; some are verb+adverb.  I had also hoped that each would
have a corresponding page on the Web site where we described each in
more detail, perhaps with a story from a Grinnellian.  After all, part of
the Grinnellian experience is analyze concepts carefully through extended
writing.  But, no, it appears that the banners are supposed to stand alone
[16].

What purpose do they serve?  I had originally thought that the banners
were supposed to be part of our campaign to attract more applicants,
particularly since they appeared at about the time the campaign was
rolled out.  And my assumption that they were part of the campaign was
part of what led me to believe that we'd have something else on the
Web site.  Particularly when I thought there was a tie to our Web site.
But people visit campus relatively late in the process.  Are these
supposed to improve the campus visits?

So all I know is that it's a Communications project.  And, as is often
the case, Communications is a mystery.

I've heard at least one person say that they are successful because
they've generated discussion.  But the discussion I've heard has been
largely critical.  I don't think that this is one of those cases in
which all publicity is good.

One of my colleagues who is also an alum [17] has suggested that one of
the great strengths of Grinnell is that it can be different things to
different people.  After all, that's a core aspect of the open curriculum.
If I ignore the really bothersome banners (e.g., "Learn Grinnellian"
and "Live Vocally"), I've started to see them as meeting that goal.
Rather than viewing this as "throw it at a wall and see what sticks"
campaign, I'm seeing it more from the "represent the diversity of Grinnell
experiences" perspective [18].   I'm not ready to embrace the campaign
[19,20], but I think I've reached the point that I can tolerate it.

Nonetheless, I still think I'd prefer banners with just one verb and
no object or modifier [21] or at least a bit more consistency in the
structure of the banners.

---

[1] And, at times, three-word phrases.

[2] I made that second one up.

[3] Or "in which I hope Grinnellians engage" [4].

[4] Insert the traditional Harvard joke.

[5] No, the 3-2 program doesn't count, even though we invented it [6].

[6] More accurately, [Grant Gale](grant-gale) invented it.

[7] Yes, I did have students build marshmallow and toothpick bridges
in "The Evolution of Technology".  I wanted them to get some sense of
the issues involved in designing structures.

[8] Dear conservative students: I am progressive, or at least liberal
in the traditional sense.  I am certainly happy to discuss with you 
different views on what progress is or should be and I will listen
to, and perhaps be influenced by, your thoughts.  
Dear more-left-than-I students: The same goes for you.

[9] Or is that "*a* hobgoblin".  Let's see, [the
Interweb](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/353571-a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds-adored)
tells me that Emerson says "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of
little minds".  I got that article right.  I forgot the initial article,
and I substituted "small" for "little".  Is getting the quotation right
"foolish consistency"?

[10] South of Noyce facing the HSSC, for those who want to find it.

[11] Well, it's upside-down if you look at it from one side.  On the other
side, "Demand Clarity" is upside-down.

[12] Authors left anonymous.

[14] If you haven't seen the legendary "Think Ahead" signs, you should
be able to find some on the InterWeb.

[15] Vampires are undead.  They will return.

[16] Or hang alone, or wave alone, or whatever you call it.

[17] No, not Jacob Jensen.

[18] I can push that far enough to accommodate the bothersome ones, too.
Some Grinnellians experience meaningless phrases, ableist comments, and
mediocre writing.

[19] Or whatever it is.

[20] If it's a campaign, I'm also not ready to enlist in it.

[21] "Muse" is a good one.

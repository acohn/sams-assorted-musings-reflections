A month of Grinnellians
=======================

As you have no doubt seen, I've written on a wide variety of topics.
(Well, maybe a limited variety: Grinnell college, computer science,
the joy of code, online teaching, a few people, lots of self-indulgent
stuff about myself or my life.)  This month, I'm going to try something a
little bit different.  Instead of allowing my muse completely free rein
[1], I will restrict myself to one general topic.  No, don't worry, I'm
not planning to try NaNoWriMo [9]; I'm not enough of a stylist to take
that on [10].  I'm doing something else.

In particular, I plan to try to write about a different Grinnellian
each day.  I've planned essays on some alums, some faculty (present and
former), some staff (present and former), and maybe even some students.

I think this will be an opportunity to challenge myself as a writer.
Profiles are not something I regularly write.  The few I've written were
harder than I expected.

My writing schedule may be a little bit off this month, since I do 
consider it appropriate to check in with a subject [13] before posting
what I've written about him, her, zir, or them.  Of course, I think
that applies primarily to living, non-public figures.  I can probably
write anything non-libelous about public figures.  And, in all but one
or two cases, I'm pretty sure that the non-living Grinnellians I might
write about are public figures [14].

I have a *much* longer list of Grinnellians I want to write about than I
can write about in a month.  And there are others not yet on my list.
My muse needs some choice!  Anyway, because my muse is guiding me
and because I'm only doing this for a month, I won't get to everyone.
I apologize to those of you who I won't get to at this time.  Unless I
discover that I really suck at these profiles, or my readers revolt
[16], I'll probably do this again another month [17].  If you'd like me
to write about you, or to write about another Grinnellian, feel free to
let me know and I'll add you or them to the list [18].

[1] I'm pretty sure it's "free rein" and not "free reign" [2,7] or "free rain".

[2] Yay for the Silent G!  If Tom Lehrer [3] were still alive [4], maybe
we could get him to write a song about it.

[3] Tom Lehrer is a famous humorous pianist who is also a mathematician,
or vice versa.  His songs even appeared in _Mad_ magazine and on the
legendary news program _That Was the Week That Was_.  He also wrote
some music for the PBS show called _The Electric Company_, including
a song called "Silent E".  I love Tom Lehrer songs [5].

[4] Yes, I know that Tom Lehrer is still alive.  I guess I could have
written "If Tom Lehrer were still writing music", but that doesn't seem
to have the same impact.

[5] Michelle is probably not happy that I have Tom Lehrer's first album
in at least three forms: 10" record, 12" record, and CD [6].

[6] Or maybe four forms; I think it appears as part of one CD on the
Tom Lehrer boxed set.

[7] Well, while the metaphor is traditionally "free rein", with the
metaphor of allowing your horse to guide, I can see "free reign"
applying to my muse, in that I am (or am not) allowing her [8] to rule
over the decision as to what I write about.

[8] My muse does not appear to have corporal (or visual, or auditory)
form, so it's not clear what pronoun is appropriate.  However, I believe
the muses are traditionally considered female, so I use a female pronoun.

[9] National Novel Writing Month, for those of you who haven't been
paying attention.

[10] Although, now that I think about it, a novel in the form of a series
of essays by a curmudgeonly faculty might be an interesting idea.  But
wasn't there something like that already?  Certainly, *Dear Committee
Members* comes close, although that's a novel as a series of letters,
recommendation and otherwise.

[11] Alternately, I could try to write a novel as a set of interlinked
footnotes.  However, that may also have been done, and it strikes me
that it would eventually become insanely annoying [5].

[12] Just like these essays.

[13] victim?

[14] I could try what some music sharing sites do: "If the subject of
this essay objects to it, send me a registered letter and I will
remove it [15]."

[15] I love the "it" at the end of that sentence.  "It" is a nice,
vague, pronoun.  I could, for example, remove the registered letter.

[16] It feels like there's a Groucho Marx joke somewhere there.

[17] And another, and another, and ...

[18] If you *don't* want me to write about you, and you see signs that
I'm thinking about it, let me know that, too [19].

[19] Please consider supplementing that request with a hundred-dollar
bill.

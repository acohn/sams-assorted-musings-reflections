Like most faculty members these days, I'm thinking a lot about how
to deal with all sorts of online teaching activities now that there's
a bit more time to plan [1].  As one of my colleagues said, "We
have a responsibility to provide online courses that are as good
as our in-person classes".  I'm not completely sure that that's
possible while keeping our lives sane.  And I think it requires
that we are able to make some assumptions about our students (e.g.,
that they can meet synchronously, that they have enough bandwidth
[2], that they have access to technology).  But I do agree that we
should do our best and I even think there can be some advantages
to remote small-class teaching.  For example, I was discussing with
a colleague about how some modes of screen sharing might better
enforce the Driver/Navigator model for pair programming.  A [recent
article from _Inside Higher
Education_](https://insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2020/05/27/will-active-learning-be-possible-if-colleges-have-physically)
even suggests that active learning may be better online than in
person, at least in a time of socially distanced classrooms.

So "online and active" is likely to be the model I'm going to pursue
for my CS classes, even if I decide to be on campus this fall [3,4].
That means I'm thinking about the tools I will use.  As I mentioned
in the prior paragraph, I'm working with others to think about
mechanisms for pair programming that range from screen sharing to
using shared development environments like Repl.It (doesn't support
Racket, need approval) and Microsoft VSCode (moderate support for
Racket).

But I'm also working on a related issue, which is how to manage my
summer research team remotely.  I realize that remote teams are
more of a norm in the commercial world, but I also know that (a)
those teams have more experienced programmers and (b) most successful
teams include an in-person component.

One thing that makes my life a bit more complex is that Grinnell
has come down pretty hard on the use of "unapproved" software and
I seem to be one of the folks who feel that it's better to follow
the rules than to make assumptions or to "ask forgiveness, not
permission".  I was happy to get permission to use Trello (although
with some limitations) but sad to discover that since Microsoft
Teams provides a similar feature set to Slack, I was expected to
use Teams.

Like most Microsoft software I encounter, Teams is a bit clunkier
than many competing offerings.  For example, Teams provides no way
to discover who on your team currently has Teams open.  And that's
been an outstanding feature request for a few years.  I'd prefer a
list of available Teams more readily available; Slack lists them
down the side.  Teams requires me to hit the "Teams' button and
then the "All Teams" button.  It also doesn't navigate in the way
I'd expect.  Still, it's nice to have individual chats and various
teams all together in one application.  And I like that it has
screen sharing (sometimes with control sharing) and audio chat.  

In any case, my team seems to be adapting fairly well to Teams and
such.  We're developing protocols of where to post different kinds
of messages and how to respond.  I've started a "Whatchaupto" channel
as a way for the team to know what people are working on, which
serves as a type of alternative to the "Which of my teammates is
online".  I hope that people can use that plus the @-sign callouts
to better communicate.  "Oh, River is also looking at how to manage
React on Windows.  I can reach out to them."  

My research team is also struggling at times.  For example, I set
up a few shared folders.  But, as far as I can tell, shared folders
don't show up naturally in the Teams interface [5].  I had students
log into Office 365, select OneDrive, and then select the Team.  In
Teams, the "Files" link doesn't take you to that list of files.
Oh, I did figure out that you can add a folder to a channel.  But
shouldn't Files do that?

Yesterday, I learned that Teams includes a Trello alternative,
called Planner.  More precisely, Microsoft provides a product called
Planner and has some integration into Teams.  So I've started to
explore Planner.  As is the norm, I'm finding it a bit counter-intuitive.
Plans don't immediately appear in your team; you need to attach
them to channels (at least as far as I can tell).  It's hard to
delete a Plan.  On the other hand, it seems like I can integrate 
Planner in Teams, which should make it easier to bring conversations
into planning and vice versa.

Now I'm waiting to see how Microsoft will next suck me into their
universe.

[1] Grinnell is still in decision mode, but it's pretty clear that at
least some classes will be offered online.

[2] Not only internet bandwidth but also emotional and mental bandwidth.

[3] Whether or not I'll be on campus this fall will likely depend on what
the College does and the advice of my physician.

[4] I would like to find a way to teach Tutorial in person.

[5] If you know how to access Team folders easily, let me know.

Lost to the Kerf
================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

**Note: The first half may become a separate musing.**

For as long as I can remember, I've enjoyed and appreciated art.
My mother clearly helped inculcate that appreciate through things
ranging from frequent trips to the deCordova and the MFA through
lessons in potterty to her own artistic work.  I'm sure that
appreciation helped lead me to the media computation course.  It
was certainly a way for me to explore my creative side while work
in my primary medium [1].

During my last sabbatical, I decided to further explore that aspect
of my personality by taking studio art and art history classes.  I
took Grinnell's introduction to art history, introduction to studio,
and sculpture, and I sat in on parts of digital art and Art Since
1945.

Since that time, I've had a variety of large-scale projects in the
back of my head that tie together what I learned in those classes
and in my own explorations, but also concepts that seem to underlie
ways I think about art and art making.  I've let some of them go.
For example, while I had [2] grand visions for something involving
thousands upon thousands of crayons, when a call came out for school
supplies for kids in Marshalltown, I thought the crayons I had
accumulated would better serve those children than my long-unfufilled
plans.  Someday, I may still come back to those.  The rest of the
projects?  Like the crayon project, they linger, held aside by my
lack of time or by other interests or commitments.

**This is a likely cutting point.  I might add a bit about my
perspectives on art making (pattern, process, instructions,
chance, loss, nature vs. machine, etc.).  See below for more
details.**

Nonetheless, almost every time I visit a museum, one of those 
projects comes to mind.  My muse suggests that I write about it
to preserve some of the primary concepts.  Perhaps that will 
even get me to make some trial runs at some works in that project.

I'll start with a bit of the background, then I will explain the
project, and then I'll reflect back on it a bit.  Or at least I
think that's what I'll do.  If not, I'll come back and edit this
paragraph.

One of the projects in Grinnell's Introduction to Studio Art involved
plywood.  I love plywood as a medium.  I'm not sure that I can
explain all of the reasons.  In part, it's the aesthetics; I love
the patterns that appear in shaped and sanded plywood.  In part,
it's conceptual; plywood speaks to some kind of simultaneous
collaboration and collaboration between nature and technology that
I have difficulty putting into words.  In part, it's the variation
in the medium; if you make two otherwise-identical pieces with two
separate pieces of plywood, they will look a bit different (at least
if you keep the grain visible).

But the real inspiration for the project was a comment from the
faculty member, Jeremy Chen, as he taught the class about the
table saw:

> Don't forget, you always lose a little bit to the kerf.

For those who don't know that saying, when a saw blade cuts wood,
you lose the width of the saw blade from what you've cut.  It's 
important, because when you're making multiple cuts from a large
piece of wood, say a piece of plywood, the loss builds up.  So it's
an impomrtant technical issue.  

But loss is also a concept that helped shaped my personality.  Hence,
over the next year or so, Chen's statement sat patiently, waiting
for the right opportunity to come to the forefront.  I'm not sure
what combination of factors did so: A desire to return to plywood,
a realization that my sabbatical was ending, an increased appreciation
for larger-scale works, something else, or some combination thereof.
But my brain decided that I should work on a project about what is
lost to the kerf, preferably at the scale of large sheets of plywood.

Here's the gist of what I came up with.

> You start with a piece of 4'x8' plywood [3].  You might finish the
plywood in one of a variety of ways [4], or you might leave it
unfinished.  You make systematic cuts in the plywood [5].  You glue it
back together.  Optionally, you repeat the process again.  And,
unlike the "lather, rinse, repeat" instructions common to shampoo,
you are encouraged to consider repeating this process multiple
times.

It's a simple process.  I thought that I would appreciate both the
ability to explore different kinds of systematic cuts and the
relationship of each board to the other boards.  And, as I said,
it provides a way to speak to loss, in both subtle and not-so-subtle
ways.  It also ties in many of my approaches to art making, including
emphasis on patterns, chance, process, and the intersection of
nature and technology [6].  It also incorporates something I appreciate
in some kinds of conceptual art, the opportunity to identify patterns.
It also feels a bit "Dada-esque" to me, but that may be because of my
failure to truly understand Dada.

Unfortunately, my brain [7] is better at coming up with variations
and plans than my will is for executing those plans.  So over the
years, I've thought more about the underlying system for making and
describing these works than I have trying to execute some of them,
even in smaller form.  In some sense, I've been focusing on the parameters
to the algorithm.  What are those parameters?  Here goes.

---

*The unit for sizes.*  I'm not sure whether I'll want to use units
other than inches or centimeters, but I might as well make it a
parameter for ease of use.  Since I like encoding things as numbers,
I'll use 0 for inches and 1 for centimeters.

*The size of the piece of plywood.*  While I envisioned the project as
using standard 4'x8' sheets, it seems reasonable to allow process to
work with other size sheets, particularly since my initial experiments
are likely to involve smaller pieces.  And, as you might expect, the impact
of the loss is likely to be more significant for smaller pieces.

*How the plywood is finished.*  Even from the start, I saw a variety of
possibilities.  It seems best to number them.

0. Unfinished.  I suppose this one is obvious.

1. Stained.  I realize that I could make the type of stain a parameter,
but it seems better to leave that as an option to the person or people [8]
who are rendering the piece.

2. Covered with the posters and flyers that often cover walls, or,
more generally, with the kinds of things you might put in a scrapbook.
I had planned to use ones I took from bulletin boards across campus
[9] over a few week period.  I may even still have those.  In any
case, I thought that these would help reinforce the sense of one
kind of loss; the memories we lose as events fall into the past.
While much of the event is there, little pieces disappear.  I can't
recall whether I thought it would make sense to update pieces with
this covering each year, to represent gradual loss, but it makes some
sense to do so.

3. A copy of some famous (or not so famous) work of art or photograph
[isn't a photograph a work of art?].  Echoes a now too-common approach
in that it treats the valuable as less so.  But also speaks to what happens
on the computer, both as people apply filters to images and as data get
lost along the way.

4. Hand-written (drawn, painted) text.  

5. Pages from a book.  Much more obvious loss, as letters are lost.

6. Diagonal line from top-left to bottom right.

7. Painted white.

8. Painted black.

9. My signature.  (Or someone's signature.)

10. Chalked white.  Possibly unhealthy to cut.

As I said, my mind is way too good at coming up with interesting options.
Part of the idea of the project is that the options will evolve over time.
I'm sure that I've had others pop into my head along the way, and that
I've now forgotten them [10].  One of the reason my muse made me write
this is so that I'd have at least one location to record ideas [11].

*The initial rotation of the board.*  My first concept was that one
would make either "vertical" cuts parallel to the short edge or
"horizontal" cuts parallel to the long edge.  Then I realized that
whle it would be more difficult to cut a 45 degree angle, it would
certainly be possible.  And if 45 degrees is a possibility, then
so is any other angle.  Hence, it makes sense to use rotation as a
metric.

*The initial spacing between cuts.*  This represents the space
between the leftmost point on the board [12] and the first cut.
The closer the cuts are to each other, the more that is lost.  In
addition, if smaller pieces are to serve as approximations of scale
models to the larger pieces, then you need to use smaller spacing.

*The formula for choosing the next spacing.* As I noted, the cuts
are to be "systematic".  But there are multiple possible sequences.
For example, one could cut every 1", or 1" from the left, then 2"
from that cut, then 3" from that cut, and so on and so forth.  As
in the case of the finishing of the board, I expect the list to 
increase over time.  Here are a few.

0. No additional cuts.

1. The spacing does not change.

2. If the initial spacing is *n*, the sequence is 1*n*, 2*n*, 3*n*,
4*n*, etc.

3. If the initial spacing is *n*, the sequence is 1*n*, 2*n*, 1*n*,
2*n*, etc.

4. Fibonacci sequence.  If the initial spacing is *n*, the sequence
is 1*n*, 1*n*, 2*n*, 3*n*, 5*n*, etc.

5. Random sequence.  Integer multiples of *n*, up to some cap.

*The formula for choosing the next angle*.  It seems that the same
sequences I've suggested above will work for angles.  I will admit
that I had not thought deeply about angles until this musing, and I
know that changing angles is likely to be a lot of work.

*The maximum number of cuts.*

*The instance number*.  Each piece can be made multiple times, but
each instantiation will be different.  The initial instance of each
piece is instance 0.

Representing these: **U** number representing units, dot, **F**
(finish), number, **C** (initial cut spacing), number, **A** (initial
angle), number, **D** (cut sequence), number, **B** (angle sequence),
number, *optional dash plus followups*, width, x, height, dot, instance.

Elide things that aren't important?  (Ofter than finish.)

The first instantiation of a plain piece of plywood [14]:
**U0.96x48.F0C0A0D0B0.0** or **U0.96x48.F0.0*

The tenth instantiation of a plain piece of plywood, one inch cuts 
parallel to the short edge: **U0.96x48.F0C1A0D1B0.9**.

The third instantiation of a plain piece of plywood, two inch cuts
parallel to the short edge, then 3 inch cuts parallel to the short
edge: **U0.96x48.F0C2A0D1B0-F0C3A0D1B0.2**

Regular 15 degree cuts, lower-left corner.  **U0.96x48.F0C0A15B0D1B1.0**

---

I have names for individual pieces, based on how they are made.
What should I call the series?  "Lost to the kerf" gives too much away.  
Perhaps just kerf as an acronym "Kinetic Explorations in Remanufactured
Fuel".

---

Plywood is 2 width x 1 height.  Would I be better off with square pieces
(say 23"x23") for the initial experiments?

---

[1] Code.

[2] And still have.

[3] I didn't think about the size.  3/4" would probably be right.

[4] More on that to follow.

[5] More on that to follow, too.

[6] Yeah, I need a better artist's statement than that.  Or maybe I
don't.

[7] What does it say about me that I refer to "my brain" separately
from "myself".

[8] Let's call them "Collaborators".  I should try to remember what 
Sol LeWitt called his.

[9] *After* the events had already happened.

[10] That somehow seems appropriate.

[11] A notebook might be better.  But I tend to misplace physical things
more than I misplace electronic things.

[12] I was going to say "left edge", but when the board is rotated, there
is no longer a left edge.

[14] Except for signature and description.

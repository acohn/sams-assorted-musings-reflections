Planning a CS Affinity Reunion
==============================

A few years ago, the College started supporting a new kind of reunion.
In addition to the standard class, cluster [1] and athletic reunions,
they added "affinity reunions", which bring together alumni who studied
the same subject.  After all, the reasoning was, many alums are as tied
to their discipline as they are to their class.  (Certainly, the sports
teams clearly enjoy coming back for their designated reunion weekends.
We'd hope that alumni would have similar affinity for their academic
major or current profession.)

My now-former colleague, Janet Davis, and I looked ahead and said to
each other "Henry Walker will be moving to senior faculty status soon.
He effectively created the major and the department.  What a great
opportunity to bring alums together to celebrate Henry and all that
he's done for the College.  Plus, it will be approximately the tenth
anniversary of the department and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
major."  We talked to our office of Development and Alumni Relations (DAR,
not to be confused with Daughters of the American Revolution or Danial
Allen Rebelsky), who seemed to think it seemed like a reasonable idea.
We were also fortunate that the legendary Jennelle Nystrom '15, a CS/Art
History major, was Student Alumni Council president, and was enthusiastic
about helping us.

Over the past year, I've been working with DAR (and with Janet and
Jennelle and others) on rough planning.  The normal model for these
things is to have a bunch of talks by alumni.  But I also know that
many of the CS alums I talk to care about what's happening in CS at
Grinnell *now*.  What are our students doing?  Do we still support Linux?
What does the Grinnell CS curriculum of N years later look like?  Do we
still try to train gadflies?  (And does Grinnell treat gadflies better
than Northwestern?)  So I worked on setting up a broad picture schedule
that included students, faculty, and alums.  DAR also suggested a 
job/internship/externship fair, which seems like a good idea to me.

When we were first planning, the reunion was supposed to happen in early
fall.  So we included a trip to CERA [2], which I thought would be a nice
way to get alumni to chat in a different setting.  However, we eventually
settled on mid-November and, well, CERA is probably too cold by then. 
But that's okay, I can handle change.

This past weekend, I worked on putting all of the pieces together,
and tried to come up with a schedule that would interest a wide variety
of people.  But I encountered a serious problem: *We have way too many
awesome alumni.*  Why is that a problem?  Because there's no way that I
can find a speaking slot for every alum who I'd like to hear speak (and
who I'd expect others would like to hear speak).  But I guess that's how
things go.  Maybe we should try to make this an every-five-year event.
(Or perhaps every ten years, since there's a chance I'll be moving on
to SFS in a decade.)  Still, I worry that some of our talented alums
will feel slighted that they were not invited to speak.  (Dear alums:
It's not that I wouldn't want you to speak; it's that we can't accommodate
everyone this time.)  And, since our alums are so talented, many also
can't make it; they are already scheduled to talk at conferences and
elsewhere.

But many of the invitations are out (not all of them, since the program
isn't quite finalized), and I'm crossing my fingers that we'll have an
interesting program ....

*Okay, I shouldn't do this one tonight.*

[1] A cluster reunion is a reunion of neighboring classes, such as
2011, 2012, and 2013.  Since Grinnellians often have friends in
neighboring classes, it's a way of encouraging additional contact.
Or at least that's how I understand it.

[2] CERA is the Conard Environmental Research Area.  It's an awesome
research station the College owns that also happens to have a building
that we occasionally use for receptions.  Plus, one part of Andrew
Goldsworthy's _Prairie Cairn_ series is there.

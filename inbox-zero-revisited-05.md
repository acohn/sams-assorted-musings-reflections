Inbox zero, revisited, stage five
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email), rambly, disjoint*

When we left off [last night](inbox-zero-revisited-04), I still had
436 messages in my inbox, of which 247 were unread.  My plan was to use
Sunday to clean through most of them.  But I also had other obligations
for Sunday.  Let's see how far I was able to get.

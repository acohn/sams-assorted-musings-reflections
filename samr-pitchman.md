Serving as a pitchman [1] for Grinnell
======================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), marketing*

In late spring, Communications asked whether I'd be willing to be the
subject of a promotional video.  At the time, I was concerned that they
were confused.  Don't I critique most of our promotional materials?  And,
well, would you want to look at me onscreen?  I know that I wouldn't.
But the agency we hired went ahead and interviewed me for a video.  They've
now released [a draft](http://motionrefinery.com/clients/GrinnellCollege/Profiles/profs/).  I should warn you that it is not yet captioned [2].  However,
to ensure some form of accessibility, I'm putting the text below.  I've
included a few descriptions of what's onscreen, but not nearly all of them.

God drinks coffee" mug, and much much more.]

It's pretty clear that computers are changing the world.  So it's important
to think about who devises or builds the technology that changes the world.
If we're building technology that affects everyone, we really need to
make sure that everyone is building that technology.

I think from day one at Grinnell, one of my strongest goals has been to
diversity the discipline: to get more women in computing, to get more
domestic students of color into computing, to get people from across
the socio-economic spectrum to pursue computing [3].

I started to teach because I wanted to make a difference.  I love Grinnell
students.  There's so many kinds of them.  I love their diversity.  I
love the way they engage.

I love that they still find ways to challenge me.

During my last sabbatical, I took studio art classes.  And I did that in
part because I like art and I had never tried to make art formally.  I thought
it would be interesting to do more formal attempts to create artistic pieces.

At first glance, CS and Art seem like very different disciplines but we have
a surprising number of students who are both art and CS majors.  Both, in
the end, are about creation.  

[Shots: Sam in office, Sam in 3813 with Charlie's students, etc.]

Sometimes, particularly in art, you make a mistake and then realize "This is 
a better way to do something".  But it also happens in computing.  You do
something that doesn't work work in the way you want but then you realize
"Oh, this is a new approach."

[Shots: Random students]

I think the strength of a place like Grinnell is that students have to
learn many different things.  They need to learn how to interpret a text
closely.  They need to learn to think like a scientist.  You have to
be able to think broadly about societies.  And I like that our students
try all of these things and do them differently.

I know I make a difference in the lives of young people and I make a
difference in the lives of *awesome* young people.  And that's such a
great feeling.  I don't know why I wouldn't want to keep doing it.

Okay, transcribing that was horrible.  I don't like how I look.  I
don't need to see my facial expressions or my large belly again and again
and again.  Watching it once was okay.  Watching it slowly and pausing?
Nightmarish.

But at least there are shots of my laptop cover and my office.  I really
do appreciate seeing some of those things in the frame.  And I like the
tie I'm wearing; it's one of my favorites [4].

What about the content?  Well, it sounds like me.  I'm not sure that it
would convince me (or anyone) to come to Grinnell, but ...

[1] What's the non-gendered term for "pitchman"?  I'm male, so I guess
it's okay to use it, but I'd prefer to find something else.

[2] I assume it will be before it is released.

[3] I did not mention other underrepresented groups, particularly those
outside the gender binary.  I do consider it my responsibility to support
students from those groups, too.

[4] I still remember buying it with my mother- and father-in-law.  It's
supposed to go with the double-breasted suit that does not currently fit
me.

As I may have mentioned, on the second or third day of _The Craft of
Creative Nonfiction_, my friend and colleague, Ralph Savarese, said
something like the following.

> It would be nice if your musings and rants used more than two sentence
structures.  You should take my Tutorial.

Thanks Ralph.

But he's probably right.  I tend to fall into patterns.  If I want to
improve my writing, I should almost certainly find a broader range of
patterns to employ.  Of course, I must admit that I thought I used
multiple patterns, but perhaps I was incorrect.

Now my first manuscript is almost due for Ralph's class [1].  As I
edit it, I should reflect on the structures I use, just so I don't
get the same comment again [3].  So I'm turning to _The Art of
Styling Sentences_ to reflect on twenty basic sentence structures.
Or is that the only twenty sentence structures?  I'm not sure.
At the same time, I can consider whether I should also use that
book for [my Tutorial](next-tutorial-2020-01-01).  It could be a
useful addition to Williams' _Style_ [4].  I've dismissed many of
the standard texts faculty use, such as _They Say, I Say_.  I wonder
what else is in play?  I wish the writing lab had a list of writing
books used by Tutorial faculty and their rationale for using them.

Before we turn to the twenty types of sentences, let's consider
some prefatory material, just as the authors of the text do.  There
are four kinds of sentences.  Do I use all four?  I should.  Let's
see.  **Declarative**.  My most common sentence form.  **Interrogative**
[5].  One of my most common rhetorical strategies is to ask a
question and answer it.  **Imperative**.  I don't give many orders.
I'm not sure that I *should* give orders in my musings, other than
"_Donate to Grinnell._"  **Exclamatory**.  I'd need to check, but
I'm pretty sure that most of my exclamations are one or two words.
Boo!  Perhaps I'll play with more exlamatories.

On to the twenty patterns.

**1. Compound Sentence: Semicolon, No Conjunction**.  I use this
structure regularly.  In fact, I see that I've used it in the first
endnote [7].  Or must these be simple sentences, joined with
a semicolon?  No, the examples don't suggest that.  I should probably
do all of the exercsies to learn this.  No time!  On to the next
one.

**2. Compound Sentence with Elliptical Construction**.  Does that not
make sense to you?  Here's the pattern that Longknife and Sullivan
provide: "S V DO or SC ; S , DO OR SC".  For example "Ralph edits
essays; Sam, code".  I don't use that.  Crap!  Ralph is right.  Or
perhaps I've used it once or twice.  I should practice that structure.

**3. Compound Sentence with Explanatory Statement**.  Or, as I think
of it, two independent clauses separated by a colon.  I'm pretty
sure that I use it regularly.  Yup, I see at least one or two
examples in my [letter to an angry alum](angry-alumni-2020-02-09).

**4. A series without a conjunction**.  I like commas.  I use this
pattern regularly.  I recall that it makes Grammarly upset; it
wants me to inser an "and" or "or" at the end.  Or perhaps I'm
recalling incorrectly.  That is, I'm recalling Grammarly's response
incorrectly, not my own writing.

I've now started to think about sentence structures and have begun
to worry about time.  I take a break to look broadly at the manuscript
[8].

**4a. A series with a variation**.  That is, things like "A or B
or C" or "X and Y and Z" [9].  Again, it's a structure I use.  I
more frequently employ a series in the traditional form, but I
don't completely eschew this form.

**5. A series of balanced pairs**.  That is, things like "J and K,
L and M, N and O".  I suppose that's a pattern I don't use all that
much.  I'm too lazy to check if I've ever used it.  I should practice,
so that I can use it more.  I also find myself puzzled.  The second
Professional Example, at least in the 2002 edition, doesn't seem to
employ that structure.  I'll think about asking Ralph.

[1] More precisely, it *was* due.  I've written parts of this musing
before turning in the manuscript; I will likely not post it until
long afterwards [2].

[2] Is that the best way to phrase that?  Would I be better off
writing it as "I will likely wait to post it until long afterwards"
or "I am unlikely to post it until long afterwards".

[3] I've already included it in my manuscript.

[4] Nope, I'm not giving up on that.

[5] Aren't you happy that I didn't write "**Interrogative?**"? [6]

[6] Did I need two question marks?  The rules of logic suggest that
I did, one for the quotation and one for the question I am asking.
However, I'm pretty sure that no editor would let that slide.

[7] I wrote the endnote before getting to the pattern.

[8] You can read about that in [my piece about editing](eng207-1b-edits).

[9] I've spent enough time with non-American speakers that I can't
tell whether or not C and Z rhyme; perhaps it's just in my head.

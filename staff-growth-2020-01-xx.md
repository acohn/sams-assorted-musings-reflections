Among the things that seems to cause tensions between faculty and staff, at least from the faculty side, is an enormous growth in the number of staff positions during Kingston’s tenure with very little, if any, growth in the number of tenure-line faculty positions.  I’ve heard that we added 100 plus staff positions during his tenure.

Now, I get as upset as anyone about Kingston’s seeming refusal to even consider growing the faculty, or to put new staff positions in competition with new faculty positions.

However, I accept that some significant growth in the number of staff was necessary. Let’s consider some reasons.

Kate Walkers deferred maintenance.

Where did they get added?  I’m sure someone has a list, but it’s not public.

Increasing regulatory complexity.  Title IX and more

Development. Pays for itself.

CLS. Huge growth. But jobs are important in this economy (and in any economy). King to credits CLS for some improvement in number of full pay. I’ll note that the trend line also follows the increase in number of CS majors after our identification as one of only four exemplars.

ITS.  Falls within deferred maintenance. Still not big enough, particularly given growth in systems and intruders.

HR.

Support folks. Dasil. Sarah.

Student support. While new sub department on diversity. Needed. Whole new sub department on disability. Needed

Safety. Strange decision. And no have much bigger patrol area.

Golf course. Strange but necessary.

Procurement manager. Should pay for themselves. (We still have not implemented travel manager.  Our travel agency sucks.). But also create hassles.

Global.

Scat to me that there are many staff members who seem to do the equivalent of at least two full-time positions. Hat happens when they retire.

SHAW.

Others probably needed. Eg web avcesiblity socialist.

Do I want more tenure line faculty?  Yes. Do I think many of these positions are at least as important?  Certainly. Wold I like to see the list of added (and removed) positions?  That would be enlightening.

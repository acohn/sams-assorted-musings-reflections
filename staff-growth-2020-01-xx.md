Among the things that seems to cause tensions between faculty and
staff, at least from the faculty side, is an enormous growth in the
number of staff positions during Kingston’s tenure, with very little,
if any, growth in the number of tenure-line faculty positions.  I’ve
heard that we added 100 plus staff positions during his tenure.

Now, I get as upset as anyone about Kingston’s seeming refusal to
consider growing the faculty, or even to put new staff positions
in competition with new faculty positions.

However, I accept that some significant growth in the number of
staff was necessary. Let’s consider some reasons.

Kate Walkers "deferred maintenance".

Where did they get added?  I’m sure someone has a list, but it’s not public.

Increasing regulatory complexity.  Title IX and more

Development. Pays for itself.

CLS. Huge growth. But jobs are important in this economy (and in any economy). King to credits CLS for some improvement in number of full pay. I’ll note that the trend line also follows the increase in number of CS majors after our identification as one of only four exemplars.

ITS.  Falls within deferred maintenance. Still not big enough, particularly given growth in systems and intruders.

HR.  Probably necessary, but also seems to have added to tensions.

Support folks. DASIL. Sarah.

Student support. Whole new sub department of academic affairs on diversity. Needed. Whole new department on disability. Needed.

Safety (formerly Safety and Security, formerly Security). Strange decision. And now have much bigger patrol area.  Plus those
intimidating cars, much more intimidating than the Honda Ridgeline.  Thought
it was a good student job; often time to get homework done, plus you get to
work with Russ.  Wait!  There are still student workers at Safety.  So what
did the new workers replace?

Golf course. Strange but necessary.  And it needs staff.

Procurement manager. Should pay for themselves. (We still have not implemented travel manager.  Our travel agency sucks.). But also create hassles.

Global Grinnell.

SHAW.

Implications of buildings.  For example, more FM staff.

CTLA.

More are still needed. E.g. web avcesiblity socialist.

It's clear to me (and to others) that there are many staff members who seem to do the equivalent of at least two full-time positions. Hat happens when they retire.

Do I want more tenure line faculty?  Yes. Do I think many of these
positions are at least as important?  Certainly. Do I think we
should be talking about whether funds should go to a new staff
position or a new faculty position?  Obviously.  Would I like to
see the list of added (and removed) positions?  That would be
enlightening.

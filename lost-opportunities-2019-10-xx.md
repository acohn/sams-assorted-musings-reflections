Lost opportunities
==================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

The other day, I mused about [my contract with
Grinnell](faculty-contracts-2019-10-22).  As I did so, I recalled
the room in our apartment in Maine where I read that contract.  Then
I recalled what I was doing while in Maine [1].  I had built an e-commerce
site for a friend's mail-order business [2].  That was back in 1997.
And I realized that, given the time, if I'd been more outgoing and
more business-oriented, I could have leveraged that code into
something successful [3,4].  Perhaps I could have been rich.  I
started to think that it was a lost opportunity.

Then I realized that it doesn't really matter.  I love my life.  I
love my family.  I love my work, particularly that I have a direct
impact on amazing young people.  And Michelle and I make reasonable
salaries; I'm not sure what I'd do with more money, other than
donate it to causes I like [5].  I don't need more stuff [6,7].

So while I may have missed an opportunity to be rich, it doesn't really
matter.  That's good to know.

[1] Other than spending time with William and Michelle.

[2] In Perl.

[3] It might have been easier if I'd used a language more sensible than
Perl.

[4] If I recall correctly, parts of it became SiteWeaver, another one of
my lost opportunities.

[5] We already do some of that.

[6] Well, it would be nice to be able to travel more with family.
And I suppose I'd be better off without a car that is as rusty as
my minivan.  But we do have enough to travel a bit and we could get
me a new car if we really needed to.

[7] It would also be nice to know that I could afford to buy my parents
former house if I wanted to.  But I'm happy with the house we have [8].

[8] With the kids gone, it even feels a bit large.  But we'll figure
something out.  And it's nice to have a place for them to come back
to.

Getting the preposition right
=============================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), language, short*

One of the big items in the news yesterday was Microsoft's confirmation
that they were purchasing GitHub [1].  I was surprised to hear Youngest
Son's reaction, which I recall was something like, "Yeah, Microsoft has
been making a big push into open source."  I find that amusing, given how
opposed Gates and Allen were to anyone sharing their BASIC compiler [2,3].

When Michelle texted me the news, the first
article I found was an article on _The Verge_
entitled "[Microsoft confirms it's acquiring GitHub for $7.5
billion](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17422788/microsoft-github-acquisition-official-deal)" [4].

Midway through the article, I found the following strange claim.

> Microsoft killed its own GitHub competitor, Codeplex, in December and is now the top contributor to GitHub, 

Of course they are the top contributor; they are contributing $7.5 billion.
Sarcasm aside, I found that strange.  I would assume that the GitHub
employees are the top contributors to the GitHub platform.  I'm not sure
who the top contributors are to Git itself.  Let's check ... [the GitHub
pulse](https://github.com/git/git/pulse) says that Junio C. Hamano, aka
`gitster`, a Google employee, is by far the top contributor.  But I may
be misreading since that's a read-only repository.

So it really doesn't make sense to me that "Microsoft ... is now the
top contributor to GitHub".  Fortunately, they linked to [another
article on _The Verge_](https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/15/12926288/microsoft-really-does-love-linux).  That article says

> Microsoft is now the top organization with the most open source contributors on Github [sic].

Ah, that makes sense.  They aren't the top contributor *to* GitHub; they
are the top contributor *on* GitHub.

You'd think they could get the preposition right.

Postscript: For some reason, Grammarly suggests that I should should
"You'd think they could get the proposition right."

[1] I wonder how our alums who work at GitHub feel knowing that they
will soon by Microsoft employees.

[2] Or was it an interpreter?

[3] I wonder if they gave any royalties to Kemeny and Kurtz for inventing
BASIC?  Probably not.

[4] I really hope that our alums who work at GitHub get a piece of that.

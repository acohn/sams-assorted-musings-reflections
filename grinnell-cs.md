Why study CS at Grinnell
========================

*Prospective students regularly ask me why they should study CS at
Grinnell rather than one of our peer institutions, like Carleton or
St. Olaf or Oberlin.  As I say in [my essay on studying cs at liberal
arts colleges vs. large universities](lac-vs-university.html), I think
all of our institutions provide a similar core to the CS education.
I very much respect the colleagues I know at these institutions, and
I think most students would be lucky to study with them, just as they
would be lucky to study with Grinnell's faculty.  So, in answering the
"Grinnell or X?" question, I prefer to say, "Both institutions provide
excellent CS educations.  I don't know all of the details at X, but I can
tell you many things that I think make Grinnell's CS education excellent."
Our peers provide some of these things.  Our peers also provide some
things that we do not provide.  I think prospective students should
decide what is best for them.  (I also don't think they should make
their cecision based on the CS department, but that's another issue.).*

Here are some of the things that make Grinnell's CS department excellent.

*Our students.*

*Our primary teaching methodology.*

*Our introductory curriculum.*

*Research opportunities.*

*Grinnell's resources.*

*Our emphasis on diversity.*

Second, we embrace "workshop style learning".  We believe that students learn CS better by doing than by listening.  For many of our courses, but particularly the courses in our introductory sequence, we use class time for students to work in small groups on a set of problems while faculty and class mentors observe, make suggestions, ask questions, and answer questions.  That also means that we regularly embrace group projects - we think students learn to communicate better in group projects and we know that "real world" CS always involves collaboration.  Third, we use a multi-language, multi-paradigm introductory sequence.  Most institutions use one or two languages and one or two models of computation; we use three languages and three models in the first three classes.  Finally, we try to provide our students with a wide variety of extra-curricular opportunities.  We usually have a dozen or more students do full-time research with us over the summer.  About two dozen students each semester serve as peer educators.  We have a very active student-led mobile application development team.  We also run weekly discussion groups about timely topics.  

However, while I know that our CS program is excellent (and listed as only one of four exemplars in the recent IEEE/ACM recommendations for undergraduate CS education, I think you should choose a college based on more than its CS program.  You should decide whether the overall curriculum meets your needs and whether it will challenge you appropriately.  You should decide whether the other students are people you would want to learn and work with.  

I love Grinnell's individually mentored curriculum because I think students better understand the purpose of their education and the individual courses in it when they help design their own curriculum.  I also love it because it means that almost every student is in the class because they want to be there, not because someone has told them that they have to be there.  That makes the classroom environment much better.

I love Grinnell students because they are bright, socially engaged, and sincerely care about their learning.  I am excited that they take courses in multiple areas and bring ideas from different courses to my courses.  I appreciate that we have a comparatively diverse student body.

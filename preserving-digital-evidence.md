Preserving digital evidence
===========================

*Trigger warning: This musing includes references to sexual assault.*

Over the past year, some of the CSC 322 students have been working on an
extended version of [Project Callisto](https://www.projectcallisto.org/),
Web-based software that provides a supportive mechaism for survivors
[1] of sexual assault to record their experiences.  There are multiple
reasons to record the experience.  It can be therapeutic in some cases.
Creating an early record can be useful if the victim later decides to
press charges.

The other day, a question came up that is related to Callisto but
is more generally applicable in such cases.  Victims are encouraged
to save evidence, both physical and digital.  For example, [Northwestern
University](https://www.northwestern.edu/sexual-misconduct/file-a-report/preserving-evidence.html)
suggests that victims should,

> Preserve evidence of electronic communications by saving them and/or by
taking screen shots of text messages, instant messages, social networking
pages, or other electronic communications, and by keeping pictures, logs,
or copies of documents that relate to the incident and/or perpetrator.

Both the standard Callisto text and Grinnell's proposed variant thereof
have similar recommendations.  But what they don't say is *where* or
**how** to preserve that evidence.  Here are some options that have
come up.

* They could send the documents in electronic form to someone in authority.
  I would not recommend that approach without associated encryption since 
  I don't generally trust email systems or email providers.  Email is also
  discoverable in court cases.  But it must be the most expeditious
  approach.
* They could save the documents in form on a DVD or a flash drive.  For
  long-term storage, I would suggest a DVD, since DVDs tend to be more
  stable than flash drives.  (On the other hand, DVDs are easier to break.)
    * The data could be encrypted or not.  A danger of encryption is that
      the victim would be choosing the encryption key in a stressful time
      and might therefore forget it.  Another issue is that the survivor
      would need to learn how to use encryption software.  A danger of 
      non-encrypted form is that others could more easily access it.
    * They could keep the item themselves or they could give it to someone
      in authority (e.g., the Title IX office or the Police).  An advantage
      of giving it to someone else is that there's a clearer evidence that
      the documents were saved at the time suggested.  Another is that
      the material is more likely to be secure.  A disadvantage is, again,
      that material held by others is more easily discoverable in court
      cases.  (I am not a lawyer and am not sure of all the implications
      of that.)
* They could save the documents in the cloud.  For the reasons mentioned
  above, I would not suggest that they use the College's cloud storage.
  (I suppose encrypted form would be okay.)  Probably the best bet
  would be to create a new cloud storage account and then save them in
  encrypted form.  The disadvantage is that they must then remember the
  new account and the encryption password.
* They could save them on their laptop or other personal computer that
  they back up regularly [2].  Once again, there's a question of whether
  they should be encrypted or not.
* They could print out all the documents and store them however they are
  storing the physical evidence (themselves, in the hands of a trusted
  authority, elsewhere).
* They could do a combination of the above.
* They could do something else that has not yet come up in discussions.

My sense is that there is a likely "best practice" for storing this
evidence.  It's not necessarily the same as the "best practice" for
storing other important documents, such as tax records, because the
evidence is a different kind of document and because the survivor is
likely in a different state of mind than most people when they are
preserving documents.

In the Grinnell installation of Callisto, we'd like to provide survivors
with good advice for storing the evidence.  But I can't find the best
practice.  I certainly wouldn't want to provide something like my list
above; there are too many options and it's likely to be overwhelming.
I've asked our new Title IX coordinator.  She wasn't sure, but plans to
ask when she's at her next training session, which happens in a few weeks.
In the mean time, I'm turning to my readers (and anyone with whom they
share my question).  

_What advice would you give to a survivor of sexual assault as to how best
to preserve digital evidence?  If you don't hae particular advice, are
there other issues would you want someone to consider as they developed
advice?_

[1] I'm using the term "survivor".  I apologize if it is not the the right
term.  My experience is that different groups tell me to use different terms.

[2] Do students back up their computers regularly?  Some I know do.  Some
I know seem to have never backed up their computers.

New computer policies
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), rambly*

This summer, ITS [1] released two new policies, one entitled
"ITS-US-800-P Provision Reuse and Lifecycle Replacement of Endpoint
Computing Devices" and one entitled "ITS-BF-800-P Software budgeting
and purchasing policy" [2].  Both are available on [the ITS policies
page](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/its/SitePages/Policies.aspx)
[5].  Various aspects of these policies bother me.  What?  Let's see.

1\. I am bothered by *a failure to appropriately include faculty
governance* in the creation of these policies.  What kind of
governance would I like to see?  For one thing, the Instructional
Support Committee is supposed to provide not only guidance, but
also leadership, on all aspects of academic computing [6].  However,
ISC was only consulted on a few issues of the policies and did not
sign off on the broader policies.  These are also policies that
have broad impact; in cases like that, Executive Council should be
consulted [7].  In fact, Council had already asked about rumors
that they had heard about shifts in computer purchasing policies
and, *in spite of their request for more information*, this policy
was not shared with Council before it was enacted.  **That represents
a significant failure of shared governance.**

2\. I am bothered by the new "endpoint computing device" policy's *poor
treatment of term faculty*.  In particular, the policy indicates
that

> New Endpoint Computing Devices are not purchased for Non-Regular Employees or Non-Regular positions. If requested, ITS will allocate a desktop Endpoint Computing Device from the Reserve Pool. Please note that there may not be a choice of operating system. 

According to the faculty handbook, Term faculty are not Regular
faculty.  That means that, according to this policy, someone the
College hires for a one-year, or two-year, or three-year position
gets whatever computer ITS feels like giving that person.  But
here's the things, we should treat our term faculty well [8] Telling
someone that they can't have the operating system they want for
their research and teaching is highly inappropriate.  In addition,
at least in my experience, using the wrong OS also makes one much
less efficient.  I am probably at least 20% more efficient on my
Mac than I am when someone forces me onto a PC.  I hear that PC
users feel lost on Macs.  Term faculty are expensive [10].  Shouldn't
we make them feel valued?  And shouldn't we get the best possible
work out of them?  Is saving $1000 or $2000 really worth what we lose? 
I think not.  [11]

I raised these two concerns as soon as I saw the new policy.  I raised them
with my Council rep.  At some point the Dean's office got involved.  I
thought I'd made my point, and changes would be made.  But I was wrong.

During the first week or so of classes, I learned indirectly that
one of my new colleagues asked for a Mac and received a PC.  Because
term faculty do not know what social capital they have, they are
unlikely to complain [12].  From my perspective, that makes it
particularly important that our default is "you get what you ask
for" not "you get what ITS feels like giving you".  Fortunately, I
have some social capital [14].  I raised the issue and it looks like
my colleague will get the appropriate computer in a few weeks.

Does that settle the matter?  No.  Here's the wonderful note I received
from my Associate Dean.

> On a related point [...] the Dean considers this an exception made due to a special request, while following the policy and procedures of ITS. That is, in supporting [Faculty Member's] request, we are not weighing in one way or another about the policy itself. If you remain interested in seeing changes to the policy, you should pursue that through other channels (which may nonetheless involve the Deanâ€™s Office).

Here's how I responded.

> Thanks [Associate Dean]!

> And yes, I am interested in seeing changes to the policy.  I've already written to you about these concerns.  What other avenues should I follow?  Do you need a more detailed description of my objections?

> Thanks again,

> -- SamR

I have not yet heard back.

I worry that this note suggests that our primary goal is to support the
desires of ITS, rather than the needs of faculty and staff.  I know that
ITS has many challenges.  But, in the end, the goal of technology policies 
should be making sure that people are appropriately supported (albeit
at reasonable cost).

*Back to the things that bother me.*

3\. I am bothered about *the timing of the announcement*, particularly
with regard to the budget cycle.  The policies, which take effect
for the 2019--20 budget year, were announced at the end of June
2019.  On the other hand, department budgets were due in late 2018.
Since the new policies suggest that departments may now be responsible
for some software and equipment purchases, the announcement should
have been made in time for changes to be incorporated into budgets.
In fact, departmental budgeting is one of the reasons that Council
asked about these issues.

4\. *The new software policy makes no explicit mention of software
for scholarship* [15].  Not so surprisingly, many faculty use
software in their scholarship.  Hence, one would expect that the
policy would explicitly discuss such funding.  But, as far as I can
tell, scholarship falls under "other academic use".

5\. *I don't see evidence of people considering implications and
connections.*  If ITS is no longer covering software for scholarship,
and the Dean's office may not be, shouldn't we be able to use our
Committee for the Support of Faculty Scholarship funds to pay for
software related to our scholarship [16]?  I also find it odd that we
don't seem to have released policies that apply to other aspects
of computing, such as tablets or hard drives.  Perhaps those are
coming in the near future.

Just to make myself clear: I don't object to the creation of policies
about selection and purchase of computing hardware and software.
Clear policies help eliminate bias and can safe the College some
funds.  What I object to is the process for creating processes,
which has left out important faculty voices, and the limited view
revealed by the policies, which is likely affected by the lack of
shared governance.

**Appendix 1: More than you wanted to know about our forms**

There's also a new [Central Software Request Form](https://grinnell.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5BGKZ54zdIOEl9P).  I tend to like to see what's on a form before I fill it out.  I couldn't find a summary, so I've created one here.

[2] I don't know why they chose different capitalization policies for
the two documents.  However, as too many people remind me, foolish
consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds [3].

[3] Am I required to cite that aphorism [4]?  And should I put it in
quotation marks?  Does it matter that I seem to have changed "little"
to "small"?

[4] It's from Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Self Reliance".  I'm not sure why 
I can't recall that.

[5] Why can't we put our policies on a public Web site?  Are we embarrassed
about them?

[6] For those who have been here less time than I have, during an attempt
to cut the number of faculty committees, the responsibilities of the
Academic Computing Committee were (ACC) folded into the Instructional
Support Committee (ISC).  I can't recall exactly when that happened,
but I think it was around 1999/2000.

[7] The full faculty should be consulted; however, I realize that
not everyone feels that way.

[8] I like to think we *do* generally treat our Term faculty well.  They
have full voting rights at faculty meetings, they receive some funding
for research and conference travel [9], they are eligible to supervise
MAPs and to be compensated for that supervision, and they are eligible,
but not required, to advise students.  They are also included in the
Early Career Faculty and Staff group, which also plans some events for
term faculty.

[9] I wish they received more.

[10] Not as expensive as tenure-track faculty, but still expensive.

[11] I hear that some staff also do not get to choose their operating
system.  That also strikes me as troublesome.

[12] Some may also not have a personality that permits them to make waves.

[14] Or at least tenure.

[15] Grinnell has traditionally used the term "scholarship" rather than
"research".  Scholarship seems to be more inclusive, particularly if one
pays attention to sources like Boyer's _Scholarship Reconsidered_.

[16] The CSFS policies specifically forbid using your scholarship funds
for computing equipment and software [17].  

[17] I've been told that some exceptions have been made, but that seems
to be somewhat ad hoc; the policies do not seem to be applied uniformly.

[18] My mind seems to keep getting smaller.

[19] Bold in the original.

[20] DLAC is the [Grinnell Digital Liberal Arts Collaborative](https://dlac.grinnell.edu/) [21].

[21] While I think of collaborative as an adjective, it is also used
as a noun.  However, [some people dislike that
practice](https://www.comnetwork.org/insights/collaborative-n/).
Unfortunately, Garner seems to provide no commentary on this issue.

[22] I thought this would be the last question, and so I wrote "Just looking at the form to figure out what questions I need to prepare to answer."

[23] Ah!  I hadn't read the prior "additional information" question
properly.  I think this is the last one [24].

[24] Why doesn't Qualtrics let you know when you're answering the last
question on a multi-page survey? [25]

[25] That seems like a good topic to muse about.  I'll add it to the list.

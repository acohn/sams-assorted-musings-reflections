Beginning-of-semester reflections, Spring 2017
==============================================

*A few years ago, when the amazing [Karla Erickson](karla-erickson.html) 
began her term as Associate Dean, she decided that part of her role would
be improving our support for what she called "mid-career faculty", which
she identified as faculty anywhere between tenure and Senior-Faculty
Status.  She's recently presented at AAC&U about a broader study she did
on these groups of faculty; there's [a nice article on _Inside Higher
Education_ about her work](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/01/26/research-midcareer-professors-makes-case-support-after-tenure).*

*Anyway, at the beginning, middle, and end of each semester, she holds
reflection sessions in which she asks us to think about a variety
of prompts and then to talk about related issues.  This essay reflects an
extended version of my responses to her prompts at a recent session [1].
I've put my inadequate summary of her prompts in bold.  I'd encourage
you to think about doing a similar self assessment.*

*Oh, Karla had us start with three deep breaths and then ninety seconds
of silence.  I'd recommend that you do that first, too.*

Quote on board: Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? - Mary Oliver

Karla asks us to think about lots of things.  Prompts, for us to think about in our head.  Pull and tug of what is exciting and what is stressful. Time at the end for talking.

Capture thoughts as you go.  Free writing.

See note below about buckets (I'll move it to the top for the essay).

## What are you excited and animated about right now?

*Almost everything seems to have a disclaimer.*

* People around me (department colleagues, students, non-department colleagues, etc.), the only one without a disclaimer.
* Realms of positivity.  I've been making an effort to do things that make a slight positive difference in other people's days (not that I haven't always), and I think it's making a difference.
* Bowling! (but I can't always make it)
* Maybe the writing (although that's been hard lately).  
* Maybe building the new course webs (although that's anxiety inducing).  
* Getting the department's business in order (fingers crossed).
* CSC 151 again (although that's exhausting).  New version of CSC 282 (if I can get it into place).
* Project in CS commons (if I can bring it to fruition).
* Trying to get more organized (if I have time).

## What is weighing on you

* Weight/health.
* The country.  I can't bear to open the newspaper.
* Do we have enough CS faculty to support our students? (+ long-term department planning).
* Variety of paperwork still to get done.
* Supporting family this year.
* Chaos of offices and lab and home.
* Code camp.
* Handling large number of advisees.

## Bucket questions

Series of related questions.

### With your teaching (large sense)

#### Identify priorities for this semester

* New course Web site infrastructure.
* Grading done for CSC 321/322.
* Regular grading everywhere?
* Start to think about new CSC 151.
* Stay on top of everything - once I fall behind, I'm screwed.

#### Things you can spend less time on

* Revisions to 151.  Let's try to keep it as is right now, particularly since I'll have a new version soon.

### Professional identity (separate from students); service and scholarship

#### Identify priorities for this semester (exciting or necessary)

* Pull together the CSC 282 stuff.
* Department paperwork
   * Assessment workshop plan.
   * Research for all document (necessary)
   * Course schedule (challenging)
* Hiring, continued work (necessary, challenging)
* Normal professional service
   * ITiCSE
   * Scholarship reviews
   * SIGCSE
* Get diversity stuff in place

#### Things that are in place to support those priorities

* Habits, at least for the normal professional service
* Colleagues (although with Henry gone ...)
* The daily essays could help with the 282 stuff, and some other things.

## Adjustments

These can be difficult for faculty set in their ways.

### What changes to your space will help?

* Straighten?  (Physical and electronic?)
   * "Big projects"
   * Daily upkeep
* Closed doors.

### Accountability - are there people or processes to make sure you get things done?

* Hired student for straightening and put in schedule.
* I have an audience for the reading.
* College deadlines for various pieces of paperwork.
* Other deadlines.
* Department colleagues to help or keep me on task (colleagues include Sarah).
* Need to restart my to-do list.  I wonder what the best form is.

## Personal Priorities (well-being and such)

* Support Michelle and kids.  Her stuff is challenging.
* Writing.  Keep it up.
* Exercise.  Start.
* Conscious about what I put in my mouth.
* Rant less?  I don't know.  Maybe I don't care.  Does it help?  I don't know.  

## Top three things you want to nurture and support this semester.  If you have a spare two hours, where should it be spent?

* Michelle and the kids.
* My health (exercise + eating).
* Organizing.  (Generally where the time goes.)

I think my focus should be to get myself "in shape" to be more productive in the future.

## What would you do with this plan if you had another hour?

* Read GTD and think about how to put the various pieces in place.

## How do you prioritize?

* "Whatever shouts the loudest."
* Do vs. should.
* Having a plan helps to get things in order.
* Having a strategy for getting back to the plan is also good.

Whoops!  I forgot the winter break financial thingy.

Note: Mid-semester one.

to do.

Open slots in Fall 2017 introductory courses
============================================

[Preregistration for Fall 2017](prereg-2017F) is now over.  [Cuts, closes,
and balances](ccb-2017F) are now over, and add/drop period has started.  
I was about to look at current space in introductory courses, but got
distracted by looking at the [CCB process](ccb-2017F).  Now that that's
done, let's see where things stand.

We should have about 450 students in the incoming class.  Let's assume
that 90% of them take three classes plus Tutorial and that the remaining
10% take two classes plus Tutorial.  I have no idea whether or not those
numbers are correct, and I haven't accounted for students who can start
in non-introductory courses, but it seems like as good a starting point
as any.  I calculate that we will need about 1300 slots in introductory
courses for those students [1].  Are we prepared, assuming that no other
introductory slots are taken [2]?

Where does that leave us?  I seem to have counted 1820 open slots for
introductory students.  I estimated that we needed 1300 slots.  That
leaves a reasonable cushion.  Even if the 200-or-so students who were
cut from other courses added these courses (and they won't necessarily
do so, since most qualify for 200- and 300-level courses), we'd still have
a reasonable cushion.  Students may not get the exact courses they want
the first semester, but they should get a good start to their liberal
arts education.

[1] Wow, that sounds like a lot, doesn't it?  That's about 54 courses,
more or less.  

[2] Note that because the languages clearly leave spots in 200-level
classes for incoming students, I've included their 200-level courses.

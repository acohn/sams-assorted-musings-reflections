Michael Perry
=============

*Topics/tags: [Reviews](index-reviews), rambly*

I remember the first time I heard (or heard of) Michael Perry.  I was
driving through the streets of Boone, Iowa [1], I turned on the radio
to NPR, and I heard someone reading a story in which one of the main
characters was falling in love with a woman because of how she treated her
leather boots [2].  I loved how it captured a particular view of the world
and the things people notice.  The story later turned to a description of
a woman in one of those late 1960's Catholic churches [3].  It resonated
with my experience with my in-laws.  So I kept listening.  Eventually,
the show moved from the reading to an interview, and I discovered that the
author was Michael Perry.  Soon thereafter, he said something like, "My
friend, Dean Bakopoulos, is a faculty member and helped me realize that
I was a bit cruel to the academic in this story.  He made it better."
Since Dean is a colleague at Grinnell [4], I sent him a note.

Then I bought _The Jesus Cow_, the book that Perry had been reading from.
It's a funny story about what happens when a quiet, private, farmer
has a calf that is born with the face of Jesus on the side and, to his
chagrin, people discover it and, well, chaos ensues.  As in the readings
from the radio, I found myself appreciating the tender, thoughtful, way
that Perry approached his characters, even the ones we might like less.
And, although the story is set in rural Wisconsin [5], it felt like it
could, as easily, apply to rural Iowa.  That is, it felt honest.  And it
also made me laugh.

Hence, I was thrilled to see an announcement that Dean was
bringing Perry [6] to Grinnell as part of the wonderful [Writers@Grinnell](https://www.grinnell.edu/campus-life/arts-culture/writersatgrinnell/events)
series [7].  I added the event to my calendar, dug out my copy of _The
Jesus Cow_ for an autograph, and waited.

I did have a moment of crisis that week.  Kate Hennessy, Dorothy Day's
granddaughter, was speaking at the University of Iowa the same night.
I very much appreciate many aspects of Day's version of Catholicism
and wanted to see that talk, too.  But I chose the Perry talk [8].
While I don't know what I missed in the Hennessey talk, I'm certainly
glad I took the time to hear Perry.  He read a variety of excerpts from
his books and, as I'd found previously, they were funny and thoughtful.
He left me wanting to read more [9].

I had also hit the point that I was losing my ability to listen to news
radio on the trip to Iowa City.  The Kavanaugh hearings and the general
state of the US made the trips frustrating.  So I decided to pick up a
few of Perry's "books on CD" to listen along the way.  Knowing that he
reads his works helped convince me that I'd want to listen.

In the two weeks since, I have now listened to all of _Population:
485_ [10], as well as the additional essays and "recorded live" segment
included in that audiobook [11].  _Population: 485_ tells the story
of his return to his hometown and his experiences reconnecting to his
neighbors, particularly through his service as a volunteer firefighter.
While there were times I found myself laughing out loud,
and I did continue to appreciate his thoughtful profiles of others (and
himself), it wasn't quite what I was expecting.  Many parts of the book
draw on his experiences as a volunteer firefighter or EMT.  And, well,
in lots of those situations, people die.  The last chapter had me in
deep tears.  That's not quite what I was looking for my drives to
and from Iowa City.  But it was still better than swearing at the radio.

I've now moved on to _Truck: A Love Story_.  So far, there's much less
death [12].  It's also entertainingly rambly, which is also one of
Perry's other talents.  At some point, I'll probably burn out.  For
now, I value the time I spend listening to the books.  And it makes the
miles fly by.

I hope Dean brings Perry back to Grinnell some time soon.

Postscript: I've been listening to a lot of Michael Perry recently.  I
wonder if it's affected the way I write.

---

[1] No, I don't think "the Boonies" comes from Boone; it's certainly nearer
a real city than, say, Grinnell."

[2] Very well, that is.

[3] I could be mistaken.  My brain envisions a cinderblock basement, but
I'm pretty sure that's wrong.

[4] And a damn good writer.

[5] I think.

[6] Why do I refer to Dean by first name and Perry by last name?  Um,
because I know Dean, and I refer to friends by first name.  However, my
general practice is to refer to people by last name.

[7] Although I regularly offer my students extra credit to attend
Writers@Grinnell, I don't make it nearly enough.  Evenings are hard.

[8] Thinking about a late-night drive home from Iowa City also helped 
me choose to be in Grinnell.

[9] It would be equally accurate to say that they left me wanting to
hear more.

[10] Perry didn't have a copy of the audiobook that day; I ended up
borrowing it from our library.

[11] I think I've made four round trips in the two weeks, a bit less than
my goal.  That's seven "CDs" of _Population: 485_ and one of _Truck: A
Love Story_.

[12] The truck is dead, at least at the start of the book.  But I don't
think I've heard about any human deaths.

_My family is slowly scattering across the country.  To help us keep
track of each other, we've started a weekly note to the rest of the
family.  At times [1], I decide to share them with you.  I tend to
edit a bit when sharing._

Dear Family,

I hope you had a good week.  Mine was pretty good although, once
again, I can't remember all of it.

Today is a palindrome: 20200202.  That makes me happy.

Mom and I saw _Come From Afar_ [2] on Wednesday night.  It's a
musical about planes that were diverted to a small town on 9/11 and
what happened in that town.  That's a strange subject for a musical,
but it was positive and affirming.  The set was simple, but well
done.  They made great use of the turntable in the center.  I was
impressed that all of the actors played multiple roles, and it was
almost impossible to tell.

On Thursday night, I saw a movie about Toni Morrison that a Grinnell
alum had a big role in creating [3]. It was also a positive, affirming
film.  But I was exhausted, which meant that I dozed off once or
twice.  I also dozed off once or twice at Thursday's Convo, which
was on historical Chinese literature and, more generally, about
ways to more thoughtfully incorporate world literature in the
curriculum.  I need more sleep.  Oh, I also learned that we are
inscribing Morrison's name in the HSSC.  I should have known that,
since there was a message on the topic on January 29.  But I seem
not to have read the message.

Being in two classes is a lot of work. (You probably know that.)
It doesn't help that I have work due for Justin on Monday and
Wednesday afternoons and for Ralph on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.
I'm a bit worried about work for Ralph's class this coming Tuesday.
We are supposed to review three of our peers' papers before class.
But they don't have to be turned in until 5pm tonight, and I have
the Super Bowl tonight, a meeting in Iowa City tomorrow morning,
Justin's class on Monday afternoon, a Faculty Meeting, and then the
Caucuses.  I'm not sure when I'll have a chance to do sufficiently
thorough reviews.

I enjoyed watching Middle dive on Saturday.  I also enjoyed making
him breakfast before the meet; it was nice to chat with him and to
see him prepare for King of Hearts.  On that note, did you know
that _King of Hearts_ was one of Grandma Freda's favorite movies?
I should find a way to watch it [4].

Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.  I finished [musing 1,000](musing-1000)
during the week.  It's hard to believe that I've written that many.

My to-do list is a bit of a problem; it seems to be getting longer
and longer.  You're probably not all that surprised.

Mom and I made our plans and reservations for
[SIGCSE](https://sigcse2020.sigcse.org/).  I'm looking forward to
being in Portland with mom.

I'm also looking forward to Caucusing on Monday.  Did I tell you that
one of the too-many candidate supporters who called today said, "Don't
forget to caucus on Tuesday"?

At tomorrow's faculty meeting, we have preliminary elections for Chair
of the Faculty.  I've left my name on the ballot and have told people
that I have no particular interest in the position, but will serve if
elected.  However, I must admit that it would be nice to be able to work
with Dean Harris and a cool opportunity to work with the new president.
On the other hand, my musings would have to change significantly and I'm
not sure my department can spare me.  In any case, we'll see what the
Faculty decide.  There are certainly some excellent candidates still on
the list.

I'm not sure what else is on my agenda for the week.  I'll figure it
out as I go.

Love you all!

[1] E.g., times in which nothing else comes to mind to muse about,
or times in which my time is limited.

[2] Mom says it's _Come From Away_.

[3] Johanna Giebelhaus '96 was the editor, lead researcher, and a
producer.  It's amazing what you can do with a Grinnell History
Degree.

[4] I see that [I can rent or buy a digital copy from
Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/King-Hearts-Alan-Bates/dp/B07DGN1C9D/).  Of
course, "buy" is probably a misnomer, given that it likely has some
form of digital protection.  [The license](https://www.primevideo.com/help?nodeId=202095490) has an interesting clause:

>  i. Availability of Purchased Digital Content. Purchased Digital Content will generally continue to be available to you for download or streaming from the Service, as applicable, but may become unavailable due to potential content provider licensing restrictions or for other reasons, and Amazon will not be liable to you if Purchased Digital Content becomes unavailable for further download or streaming.

I can "buy" it and not have access to it.  That seems fair [5].
You'd think that Amazon would have a responsibility to return my
purchase price in such cases.  Isn't that what happened with [_1984_](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html)?

I could also purchase a [DVD](https://www.amazon.com/King-Hearts-Alan-Bates/dp/B000059H9D/)
[Blu-Ray Disc](https://www.amazon.com/King-Hearts-Blu-ray-Adolfo-Celi/dp/B07BRZYT32/) or [a combined region 2 version](https://www.amazon.com/Hearts-Masters-Cinema-Format-Blu-ray/dp/B07C5S33B4/).  There are other issues with the
long-term accessibility of these, too.  Now I wonder if the Amazon stream
is 4K.

[5] There must be a better way to include sarcasm in written text.

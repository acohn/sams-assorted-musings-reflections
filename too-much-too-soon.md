Bad writing choices
===================

*Topics/tas: [Writing](index-writing), short*

The other night, I was putting the finishing touches on a paper on the
"language and code" camp.  While that camp had some successes, it was
clear that we had tried to cram too much content into the camp and that
the campers did not necessarily have the background to reflect on all
of the things we were doing, such as the knowledge of syntax 
appropriate for language generation.  So I wanted to say that we were
trying to do too much, too soon.  But, well, my brain is damaged [1].
Hence, the first thing I wrote was, 

> This approach, like the New York Dolls' second album, was too much, 
too soon.

It took me a bit of reflection to realize that that phrase, while amusing
[2], certainly doesn't belong in a professional paper.  I'm not even
sure anyone would appreciate it. I expect that only a small fraction of
the people who read CS education papers would have any clue about the
mid-1970's New York punk scene.  The odds that one who did would read
the paper is slim.  And, to be fair, very few people appreciate my sense
of humor in any situation.

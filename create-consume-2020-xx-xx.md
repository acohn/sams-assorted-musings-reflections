When I think about the creative aspects of my life and career (e.g.,
art, musing, programming, scholarship), I struggle to figure out
how best to balance what I think of as *creating* and *consuming*.
That is, what portion of my time should I spend making my own works
and what portion should I spend looking at and reflecting on the
works of others?  My end goal is to create.  But I know that I will
create better if I am informed by careful study of the works of others.

It's more complicated than that.  Rather that just two C's, there
are probably at least four P's: Should one produce, practice, ponder
(a better word than comsume), or even just play (such as to learn
something new)?  I tend to fall more on the create side (or produce
and play, when I consider all four).  I'd often rather muse than
read, program than read a program, conduct research than read
research papers, sculpt or design sculpture rather than look at or
read about scuplture.

Ralph Savarese's syllabus for _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_
shares a tip about these issues.

> Thirty-four years in the classroom has taught me that creative
writing courses need to focus primarily on exemplary models. By
practicing what we discern, we can begin the process of not only
finding our own voices but also producing noteworthy work. This is
the enabling paradox of art: originality comes from deeply absorbing
and re-constellating the achievements of others.

Now that's a great title for something: _The Enabling Paradox of Art_.
Perhaps, someday, I'll feel that I can write a piece that lives up 
to it.  But for now, I'll continue to struggle with the choices.

Note that Ralph writes, "deeply absorbing", which I've rephrased
as "pondering".  You don't just glance at a work to learn from it.
You explore it deeply, considering the crevaces, the things that
make it special.  Perhaps even finding a few flaws.  After all, no
work is perfect.  Or at least almost no work.  I'm also reminded
of what Jeremy Chen told me about visiting museums; rather than
trying to explore all of the work, you should find a few pieces
with which you engage deeply.  I'm not always able to follow Jeremy's
advice, but I try.  

There are times that it feels right to engage with a group of works,
rather than an individual work.  After visiting Elias Sime's
_Tightrope_ exhibit, I felt myself compelled to return to consider
the different aspect ratios he used, the recycled media he chose
for different pieces, how he aligned the panels (in a grid or offset,
as with bricks; horizontally or vertically).  Was I exploring technique
as much as the works themselves.  Probably.  But part of the goal of
deeply absorbing a work is to understand some of those techniques.

Grinnell vs. Stanford
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), academia*

Given that a student I know well is now going to Stanford, I've had
the opportunity to think about some similarities and differences between
the two schools.

Bigger, more famous, in a more beautiful part of the country
(unless you like your weather to vary significantly [and I don't count
fires as weather]), more prestigous.

But there are many ways in which Grinnell is better [or at least in
which I find Grinnell to be better].

**Aid**

Stanford, 1/2 of undergraduates receive need-based aid, with an average
aid package of $52,030.  (https://news.stanford.edu/2019/12/03/trustees-set-2020-21-tuition-expand-financial-aid-middle-income-families/).  Slightly under 70% receive some form of aid.

Grinnell. 65% of undergraduates receive need-based aid, with an average
aid package of $46,609.  (https://www.grinnell.edu/admission/financial-aid)
86% of our students receive some form of aid.
Or is that just the grant/scholarship award?  Many pacakges also include
work-study [even though work-study is a bit of a fiction at Grinnell, since
all jobs appear to be open to all qualified students].

**Break**

Grinnell: We acknowledge that students may not be able to go home (although
we need to do a better job) and keep the dorms open.   (Sometimes have
to rely on food pantry for food :-(.)

Stanford: Dorms are closed.  Rely on parent/alumni network to help support
the students who can't go home, but, from the parents page, it sounds like 
the process for students is not clear.

**Music Lessons**

Grinnell: Free (at least the first set each semester; if you're crazy
enough to want to take, say, four different sets of lessons, you need
to pay for three of the four sets [or declare a music major].  Available
to all.  And even if you have to pay, much cheaper.

Stanford: More expensive.  Require auditions.

**Concert trips**

Grinnell: Supported.

Stanford: Unclear.

**Cost of Events**

Stanford: Costly.

Grinnell: Free.

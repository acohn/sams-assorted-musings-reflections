Complaints about captioning, take 1
===================================

As I think I've noted in an earlier essay or two [1], the College has both
a moral and a legal responsibility to ensure that the materials we produce
are accessible [2].  One of the easier ways to ensure accessibility is to
caption videos.  Good captioning is helpful, and even provides a form of
universal design in that it can help people who may have trouble with accents,
or want to search or whatever.  I care about captioning, in part, because
I am gradually losing hearing.  I can still hear, but I clearly can't hear
as much or as well as I used to [3].  I also care about captioning because
I think it makes videos more usable; some of my early attempts to do 
work in multimedia was thinking about how such captioning would help
students search video lectures [4].

I also know that the Justice Department has been starting to target
colleges and universities who are not careful in their captioning.
Harvard, for example, got in trouble because one of their EdX MOOCs
was not correctly captioned.  That's not to say that it wasn't caption.
Rather, they'd relied on software (or perhaps unsupervised Amazon Turks),
so the written words were not always appropriate approximations of the
spoken text.

Captioning also strikes me as a comparatively easy and straightforward
first step in working toward accessibility.  It's certainly easier
than, say, thinking about how you are going to make an interactive data
graphic accessible.  

For all of these reasons, I tend to get frustrated when I see the College
fail to caption videos appropriately.  Let's consider an example.
[Ana Karin Kozjek '17 was just designated Midwest Conference Women's 
Swimmer of the Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSVzPpmys) [5,6].
Let's compare what Ana and her interview, Ted Schultz, actually said
to what appears in the video.

Here's my attempt to transcribe the four-minute video.  

> _TS: Hi there I'm there with Ana Karin Kozjek.  She is a Grinnell College
Women's Swimming Swimmer, and this week was named Midwest Conference
Swimming and Diving Performer of the Week.  Congratulations._

> AKK: Thank you.

> _TS: Well tell me a little about your week.  We were at the Grinnell
Mini-Invitational and you won four events.  A very busy day for you:
Three individuals and a relay.  Talk about your performance._

> AKK: Yeah, it was a very challenging week overall because I decided to
swim some of the most challenging performances from the races that I swim
often and that are like very high pressure for me.  And one after another
was challenging.  But [indecipherable] and it was a great practice.

> _TS: Well, you had a great career here.  Talk about some of the highlights
for your during your career here._

> AKK: Highlights.  Every conference, every single year.  It's not just 
swimming.  It's so much more.  The emotions, the team.  They are like
the highlights.

> _TS: This season's been wonderful.  Talk about how the season so far,
how it's has gone._

> AKK: The season; it's been great.  Yeah, I'm very happy about how it went.
I worked harder then last season because I was here all season.  Last year,
I was studying abroad as well, so that made a big difference.  So, yeah.  I
feel pretty prepared.  I feel that the team is getting healthy.  

> _TS: [Laughs.]_

> AKK: We had a bit of a mysterious disease episode, but now we're getting
back into the groove.  So, yeah, I think we're going to finish strong?

> _TS: Were you one of the ones affected by that disease?_

> AKK: Slightly.

> _TS: Slightly._

> AKK: Um, Yeah.

> _TS: Now, you had the opportunity to go to the Olympic games this year.
Talk about that and how/why you were down there and what not._

> AKK: So, my mom is the team doctor for my national team, the Slovenian
team.  And we went there; I went there because of her mostly.  It's not
very often that I get to see her.  So that was beautiful.  I was also
spending my whole summer in South America.  So that was just one of the
stops.  And it was just a amazing, amazing thing to see.  To see the whole
background that's going on besides the Olympic show.  

> _TS: Uh huh._

> AKK: I saw the life of people, like in favelas and everything.  It's a great
opportunity to see, like everything beside the show.

> _TS: You also had a teammate swimming there._

> AKK: Yes.  Yeah. Josh.  Of course.

> _TS: Yeah, yeah._

> AKK: He's gets so annoyed.  He's going to get so annoyed by mentioning him.

> _TS: [Laughs]_

> AKK: But, yeah, it was great to see him.  It was great to see Tim
[Hammond], the coach.  And we went together to see the Christ the Redeemer.
It was just such an adventure.  And seeing everyone coming together: My
my mom  and coach and teammate.  It was just magical.

> _TS: A great chance to do a lot of great things._

> AKK: Yeah.

> _TS: So you have the conference meet coming up in a little over a week.
Talk about your expectations there._

> AKK: Well, I want to have no regrets.  It's my last meet, 
probably.  I'm going to finish my career after that.  So I want just
want to go in, swim the best I can, have fun, have a lot of fun, make
memories, support the whole team.  We're going for the win again.  I think we 
can do it, honestly.  I hope all the best.

> _TS: Oh absolutely.  What's your major, and what do you plan to do with it?_

> AKK: I'm a Biological Chemistry major with a Neuroscience concentration.
And this week, I have just submitted my application for studying medicine
back home in Slovenia.  So that's pretty much determined.  I'm going to go
back.  And, yeah, I'm excited for everything.  I had an amazing four years
here, but I'm ready for a new adventure.

> _TS: Absolutely.  Well again, Anna, thank you so very much.  It's been
fun watching you over these years, and looking forward to a
big conference meet._

> AKK: Thank you.

> _TS: Thank you._

That took me thirty minutes, but I don't have the normal accessories
for pausing and rewinding, so I was just bouncing between windows on
my Mac.  I should also add time codes, but this is just intended as an
example.  

Now, let's see what you get when you choose closed captioning on the
video.

"Yeah, no", as my students say.  I don't think anyone who relied only
on the "transcription" would have any idea what was being discussed.
I'm also pretty sure that no one even looked at the captions, or they
wouldn't have allowed the transcription to include a reference to body
parts (a bit before the strange reference to "Mexican").  That strikes
me as failing in our responsibilities, not only to those who might want
to watch/read the video, but also to Ana.

I've done my best to do my part.  I complained when they posted it on 
Twitter.  I sent email to the AD, the College Webmaster, the College
Associate Dean for Disability Services, and our Social Media Specialist [7].
I've posted this essay.  And I transcribed the video and added it to the
Facebook page.  I hope that incentivizes whoever does the video postings
for athletics to do the same.

[1] Or three or more.

[2] I think there are cases in which the burden of accessibility is so high
that it's reasonable to provide alternatives.

[3] I tend to blame it on the Go-Go's concert I saw in Grant Park when I
was about nineteen, and I stood next to the tall towers of speakers right
next to the stage.

[4] I think that ended up as a discarded "work in progress".

[5] She's received this honor in the past, too.

[6] Ana continues our series of awesomely talented students from Slovenia.

[7] Only our Social Media Specialist replied quickly, and she noted that
she was not charged with anything having to do with those videos.

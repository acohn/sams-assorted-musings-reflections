"Wasting" a morning
===================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta), [overcommittment](index-overcommitment), short*

The other day, I decided to start my day at the Obermann center by
sketching [1] a few forthcoming musings.  What were those?  Since I'd
just finished my trip to the center, I wrote some notes on a forthcoming
musing on traveling to the Obermann center.  I've been dealing with
some email complexities, particularly as I switch between laptops,
and so I took some notes about that, too.  On the trip, I'd been
thinking about a variety of issues and wanted to sketch a bit about
those issues, too.  I'd recently attended [the first Obermann Seminar
of the semester](obermann-seminar-01) and wanted to get my notes for
that seminar in place.  I was in the midst of writing my [preliminary
schedule for the new CSC 151](fundhum-schedule-00) and, in realizing
that I referenced [SMURFs](course-smurfs), I decided that I should get
my notes on SMURFs in place.  Writing that schedule had also led me
to begin switching some of the technology behind the musings, and so I
wanted to sketch a musing about those technologies.

At noon, I realized that I'd been writing [2] for about four hours [3].
So I asked myself "Did I waste my morning at the Obermann Center?"
I decided that I had not.  I'd written over 3400 words [4].  And,
at a time in which I've been finding myself confronting [writer's
block](writers-block-2018-08-28) [5], any writing is useful writing.
More importantly, some of the writing helped put me on task.  In
particular, writing about the seminar helped me reflect more broadly
on my approaches to scholarship and on my current project.  Finally,
it's good to have a backlog of substantial sketches for the days in
which I don't have a lot of time to muse; the sketches can also give me
time to do more substantial work on some evenings when I might otherwise
be musing.

The answer is "No, I did not waste my morning at the Obermann Center."
Of course, I should not make it a regular habit to spend four hours
taking notes and writing about six or seven different topics that are
not necessarily relevant to my projects at hand.  But it's okay to do
so every once in a while.

It was clearly a day in which topics were racing through my head.
In fact, I had also been thinking about a variety of other issues, such
as uses of visualition in the digital humaniaties [5], accessibility
in computers [6], and my experience with online music archives [7].
Nonetheless, I decided to stop with the sketches I had already written
[8].  It helped that I had to leave for a meeting at 12:30.

[1] I use the term "sketch" for the action of taking notes in preparation
for writing a musing in the future.  It's not a perfect term, but it
suggests the rough form of the work.  "Draft" feels too substantial;
many sketches are a disorganized collection of notes.  "Outline" feels
both too organized and too slim; the notes often include full paragraphs.

[2] Well, sketching.

[3] That's not quite true.  I was also working on transferring email and
email settings between laptops, answering email questions, and completing
a variety of other relatively menial tasks.

[4] Over 3700, if we include the sketch I wrote for this musing.

[5] Relevant to my current work.

[6] Also relevant.

[7] Not as relevant.

[8] Plus the sketch for this one.

On April 1, I shaved my head.  As I suggested [at the time](april-fools-2020),
I thought making a big change to my appearance might motivate me to make
other changes.

Conclusion: I look like Uncle Fester.

Michelle says that I also nicked my head way too much.  Michelle and
Jonathan noted that I missed spots by the ears.

> Day zero (the day I cut my hair): Vacuumed and washed all the
furniture in the family room.  Started working on a report that I
had been putting off.

Seems like a good start.

> Day one: Got up.  Prepped for class.  Attended class.  Worked on
the draft of my manuscript for class.  Made lunch.  Made tollhouse
bars.  Worked on the draft manuscript some more.  Spent a few minutes
on Plans.  Fixed some problems at the rental.  Took a walk.  Dealt
with my email for the day while watching [Jon
Richardson](joy-amidst-whatever-2020-03-16).  Worked on my home
office for over an hour.  Straightened up my workspace in the dining
room (that is, removed all my stuff from the workspace in the dining
room; I hope that I can move it to my home office by Monday).
Replaced feet on one kitchen chair.  Fixed and re-glued a dining
room chair.  Mused.  That's about thirteen hours.  Didn't take a
nap.  Fell asleep watching TV.

Achieved most of my primary goals.  Didn't have time to read (maybe
later).  Didn't pick something from my "[create and
consume](create-consume-2020-03-09) list (which doesn't really
exist).  But the three-or-so hours I spent drafting the manuscript
probably counts.  

> Day two: Slept in.  Felt like I needed to.  Doesn't help that I
woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep.  Started
dealing with email.  A few major declarations.  A letter of
recommendation.  Watched Emma Schaefer while composing the letter.
Worked on home office (even worse than my lab).  Looked at some
computer stuff for Michelle.  Read a bit (thinking about Wayne
Booth's _Harper & Row Reader_ for Tutorial).  More email.  Cleaned
out dishwasher.  Back to the home office.  Suddenly realized that
it was already 4pm.  Started to muse while watching Jon Richardson.
Ended up doing a bunch of other paperwork.  Made dinner.  Ate dinner
with family and talked.  Cleaned up from dinner.  (The tripartite
dinner sequence took about two hours.)  Mused for a bit.  Hung out
with the family, playing pinball, repairing the pachinko machine, and
watching the 3D printers make masks.  Returned to the living room
to finish musing while my kids played <i>Super Smash Bros Brawl</i>.

It was a day in which it was hard to get myself to do stuff.  In the past,
I would have gone back to bed.  But I've made a commitment to move forward
on lots of tasks.  So I'm trying.  Didn't read as much as I would like
to.  Didn't write as much as I'd like to.

On April 1, I shaved my head.  As I suggested [at the time](april-fools-2020),
I thought making a big change to my appearance might motivate me to make
other changes.

Conclusion: I look like Uncle Fester.

Michelle says that I also nicked my head way too much.  Michelle and
Jonathan noted that I missed spots by the ears.

Day zero (the day I cut my hair): Vacuumed and washed all the furniture
in the family room.  Started working on a report that I had been putting
off.

Day one: Go up.  Prepped for class.  Attended class.  Worked on the draft
of my manuscript for class.  Made lunch.  Made tollhouse bars.  Worked on
the draft manuscript some more.  Spent a few minutes on Plans.  Fixed some
problems at the rental.  Took a walk.  Dealt with my email for the day
while watching [Jon Richardson](joy-amidst-whatever-2020-03-16).  Worked
on my home office for over an hour.  Straightened up my workspace in the
dining room (that is, removed all my stuff from the workspace in the dining
room; I hope that I can move it to my home office by Monday).  Replaced
feet on one kitchen chair.  Fixed and re-glued a dining room chair.  Mused.
That's about thirteen hours.  Didn't take a nap.  Achieved most of my
primary goals.  Didn't have time to read (maybe later).  Didn't pick

(which doesn't really exist).  But the three-or-so hours I spent drafting
the manuscript probably counts.

Day two:

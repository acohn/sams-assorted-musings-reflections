On April 1, I shaved my head.  As I suggested [at the time](april-fools-2020),
I thought making a big change to my appearance might motivate me to make
other changes.

Conclusion: I look like Uncle Fester.

Michelle says that I also nicked my head way too much.  Michelle and
Jonathan noted that I missed spots by the ears.

Recording a journal of each day, of sorts, followed by some comments.

> Day zero (the day I cut my hair): Vacuumed and washed all the
furniture in the family room.  Started working on a report that I
had been putting off.

Seems like a good start.

> Day one (Thursday): Got up.  Prepped for class.  Attended class.  Worked on
the draft of my manuscript for class.  Made lunch.  Made tollhouse
bars.  Worked on the draft manuscript some more.  Spent a few minutes
on Plans.  Fixed some problems at the rental.  Took a walk.  Dealt
with my email for the day while watching [Jon
Richardson](joy-amidst-whatever-2020-03-16).  Worked on my home
office for over an hour.  Straightened up my workspace in the dining
room (that is, removed all my stuff from the workspace in the dining
room; I hope that I can move it to my home office by Monday).
Replaced feet on one kitchen chair.  Fixed and re-glued a dining
room chair.  Mused.  That's about thirteen hours.  Didn't take a
nap.  Fell asleep watching TV.

Achieved most of my primary goals.  Didn't have time to read (maybe
later).  Didn't pick something from my "[create and
consume](create-consume-2020-03-09) list (which doesn't really
exist).  But the three-or-so hours I spent drafting the manuscript
probably counts.  

> Day two (Friday): Slept in.  Felt like I needed to.  Doesn't help
that I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep.
Started dealing with email.  A few major declarations.  A letter
of recommendation.  Watched Emma Schaefer while composing the letter.
Worked on home office (even worse than my lab).  Looked at some
computer stuff for Michelle.  Read a bit (thinking about Wayne
Booth's _Harper & Row Reader_ for Tutorial).  More email.  Cleaned
out dishwasher.  Back to the home office.  Suddenly realized that
it was already 4pm.  Realized that I'd missed the Faculty Friday
on Shared Governance.  Damn.  Started to muse while watching Jon
Richardson.  Ended up doing a bunch of other paperwork.  Made dinner.
Ate dinner with family and talked.  Cleaned up from dinner.  (The
tripartite dinner sequence took about two hours.)  Mused for a bit.
Hung out with the family, playing pinball, repairing the pachinko
machine, and watching the 3D printers make masks.  Returned to the
living room to finish musing while my kids played <i>Super Smash
Bros Brawl</i>.  Watched TV with the family until midnight or so;
didn't do much while watching TV.

It was a day in which it was hard to get myself to do stuff.  In the past,
I would have gone back to bed.  But I've made a commitment to move forward
on lots of tasks.  So I'm trying.  Didn't read as much as I would like
to.  Didn't write as much as I'd like to.

> Day three (Saturday): Slept until 9am.  Worried about writing the
rest of the manuscript for English 207.  Considered scrapping the
whole thing and starting again on a new topic (remote learning).
Lay in bed considering options.  Decided to stick with original
topic, which meant that I needed to get up and keep working.  Read
email.  Worked on my manuscript for a few hours (also talked about
a various things with Michelle along the way).  Spent some time
working on the home office.  It looks like I had not cleaned out
the center drawer of my desk since mom died.  Worked more on the
manuscript.  At 1pm, took a break to watch a concert online, to
muse a bit, to send declaration reminders to my undeclared advisees,
and to catch up on other email.  After the show, I returned to my
manuscript for another hour and then went for a walk with a friend.
I spent an hour walking, but my damn watch only gave me credit for
twenty minutes.  Back at home, I had a gin-and-tonic with Michelle
(one of the best outcomes of our trip to Portland: Michelle learned
to like gin-and-tonics), dealt with some email, and returned to my
manuscript.  I think I've spent more than a full day (eight hours)
on it by now, and I haven't even gotten to editing yet.  At 5:30,
I went off to pick up dinner.  (We're trying to order out once a
week to help support local businesses.) After dinner, read a bit
of a book related to the work for ENG 207, then finished the initial
draft and started cutting.  Once it was down to six-or-so pages,
discussed the manuscript with youngest son.  Finished at 9pm or so.
Realized that I had missed two streaming concerts I had intended
to watch.  The manuscript is now half a page too long.  Took [a
personality quiz](personality-quiz-2020-04-04), mused about it, and
socialized on plans for a few minutes, all while watching TV.
Continued watching TV with my family until 11:00pm or so.

Exercise.  Check.  Do homework.  Check.  Perhaps double check.  Work
on creativity.  We'll count the homework.  Muse.  Check.  Work on
office.  Check.  A successful day, although a long one.

> Day four (Sunday).  Woke up at seven a.m., worrying about the
manuscript.  Worked on it until nearly 8:30 a.m.  Rechecked my list
of goals.  Worried that in editing, I had removed most of the
parenthetical remarks.  (Parenthetical remarks had been one of my
writing goals.)  Realized that there were still many parenthetical
remarks in the footnotes.  (Footnotes were also a writing goal.)
Decided to put the essay aside for a bit.  Read some email.  Found
myself amused that I got a USPS Informed Delivery Daily Digest which
informed me that I am getting neither mail nor packages today.
Composed an email to the Dean about [summer
MAPs](summer-2020-maps-2020-04-03).  Set it aside to send later.
Wasted time on social media (and filled out a Stanford Survey about
effects of the pandemic).  Went back to bed at about 9:15 a.m.
Didn't wake up again until 12:15 p.m.  Stayed in bed for about 30
minutes, reflecting on work and tasks.  Started on dinner prep.
Straightened kitchen.  Made brunch for family.  Cleaned up.  Did
some more dinner prep.  Suddenly, it was 2:30 p.m.  Dealt with some
email, including the outstanding letter tot the Dean.  Converted
my assignment sheet to [a musing](eng207-2b-assignment).  I had
expected that editing the converted version would lead to some
changes, but it did not.  Submitted my manuscript.  Went for a walk
with Michelle (masked, of course).  Put the roast on.  Sat on the
porch to read for a bit.  Did some writing.  Watched the Stanford
Sunday Evening Mass with my family.  Had dinner with my family.
Cleaned up from dinner.  Posted my musing.  Read Plans while watching 
TV.  Off to bed around 10:30.

I accomplished most of my daily goals today.  I did something creative,
although it was tied to my class.  I read.  I exercised.  I mused.  I
did some other work (although not enough).  I didn't work on my home 
office, but I think I deserve one day off from that.

---

Conclusions: Still feel like I'm not getting enough done, even
though I seem to be working full days.  But I'm exercising more (or
at least walking more, which is my current exercise).  I'm not
slacking off as much.  I've made some progress on my home office.
I don't think I could be doing more.  Let's hope the second week goes
as well as the first.

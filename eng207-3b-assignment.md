Today I turned in my third manuscript and assignment for English 207,
_The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_. As you may recall from [a
previous musing](eng207-1b-assignment) and [another previous
musing](eng207-2b-assignment), we are supposed to pick a model piece
from those we read, identify some techniques the author used, turn
those into guidelines in an assignment for ourselves, and then write
a manuscript that follows those guidelines.  For the first two
pieces, those manuscripts were five to six pages.  This time, our
manuscripts are eight to ten pages.

The previous two times, we had an assigned genre.  This time, we
got to choose our own genre (other than the two already assigned).
I chose Lyric, Reflective, and/or Experimental Memoir.  That seemed
to be more of a challenge to myself than, say, mimicking David
Foster Wallace [2].  I play with language, but not to the extent that
you would expect in a lyric essay.  I tend to write linear text,
to connect explicitly the parts of the pieces I write.  There are obvious
connections even when I ramble [3].  But this genre asks us to make
larger leaps, to leave bits missing for the reader to fill in, or not.

**Assignment**

Model piece: Elizabeth Graver’s "Migrate" from _Seneca Review_ Fall
2009/Spring 2010, Volumes 39/2–40/1, pp. 64–65. Stephen Kuusisto [4] 
and Ralph James Savarese [5], Editors.

A few standard aspects of Lyric, Reflective, and/or Experimental Prose, present in Graver.

a. Make huge paratactic [6] leaps. Graver does not use the almighty return bar to separate sections, but I have chosen to do so.

b. Experiment with language, with sentence structure.

c. Pay attention to rhythm.

d. Weave together multiple threads.

Particular aspects of Graver’s work.

> 1\. Build on relationships to family, closeness and distance.

> > The opening and ending reflect on her daughters and physical contact with them.

> 2\. Include at least one inappropriate joke. 

> > "‘Welcome to Jonestown!’" (p. 65)

> > "_Try not to lick the floor_." (p. 65)

> 3\. Use italics and parentheticals, but limit their use.

> > Graver uses italics twice in two pages. Once in "how _cared for_ she’d felt", once in a quotation (or sign).

> 4\. Ask and answer questions. Some answers are short, a few words, a sentence. Other answers can be longer.

> > "Where have you been? Where have you lived? I have lived in Paris. I have lived in a house in the woods, another in the fields." (p. 64)

As I mentioned [recently](eng207-3b-drafting), I had not explicitly
written the assignment when I first drafted the essay.  I had
Graver's piece in mind, as well as the genre, but I had not spelled
out everything I wanted to use from it.  I knew that I could not
reach Graver's level of rhythm and lyricism, but I liked the piece
and wanted to see what I could take from it.  Graver's was also the
first pathography [7] we read, and Prof. S's discussion of pathographies
helped shape my plans for the essay.  I suppose I should have made
that part of the assignment.  "Write a pathography that breaks from
the standard narratives."  I guess that was implicit rather than
explicit.  Whoops!

Beyond that huge component, the first of these tasks was on my mind
throughout the drafting.  The second and third required a bit of
rewriting and rethinking.  But the fourth!  The fourth task (questions)
didn't come to mind until I reread Graver.  It ended up leading me
to restructure my piece in surprising ways.  

My manuscript is almost nothing at all like Graver [8], but the
piece and associated tasks did help me shape it.

I'll share it with you tomorrow.  Or at least I plan to.  You never know.

[1] Or assignment and manuscript.

[2] That's not to say that mimicking DFW is easy.  Rather, it's that
excessive use of footnotes (an obvious characteristic of DFW) is part
of my everyday writing practice.

[3] I don't always ramble, do I?

[4] We read a book by Kuusisto this semester.  It was lyrical in other
ways.

[5] Isn't it fun to see what your instructor does in their spare time?
And how does Ralph find spare time for something like that?

[6] A new word I learned on the first day of class this semester.  One
contrasts parataxis with hypotaxis.

[7] Another new word!

[8] More precisely, nothing at all like Graver's essay.

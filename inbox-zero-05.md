Inbox zero, stage five
======================

You may recall that in [the previous state of our saga](inbox-zero-04),
I had achieved "inbox zero".  All six of my inboxes had zero messages.
This essay serves as a bit of a followup.  I'm not writing it in one
day [1]; rather, I'm hoping to log short vignettes about my attempts to
stay at inbox zero [2].  We'll see how it goes.

When I got up at 7 a.m. after acheiving inbox zero, I had 46 messages
in my inbox.  Most are low priority and worth skimming.  A few notes
from racket-users that I can immediately delete.  A few SIGCSE-members
ppostings (including one that my co-moderator seems to have approved at 5:00
a.m.) that I can deal with quickly.  Still too many advertisements,
but most are either from places whose ads I like to skim (e.g., book
publishers).  One Facebook comment on my latest essay.  And soem other
stuff.  But no time to go through the mail now; the household is getting 
ready for school and work.

Okay, let's see how long it takes to get through the messages in
the inbox.  Once again, some can be deleted quickly.  Others will take
more time.  Chronicle has a story that begins "Professors can't be fired
based on race, for instance, but what happens when students write racist
evaluations? Could an instructor be fired based on those?" which I'd
like to read.  I may leave that in the mailbox, along with this week's
"Straight Dope".

Let's deal with the Facebook comment.  [Doug Cutchins](doug-cutchins)
writes.

> I'd recommend a program called [unroll.me](https://unroll.me/) that
you can use either to unsubscribe from emails or have ones you want to
see rolled into one email that they send you daily, rather than receiving
them individually.

I take a quick look.  It appears to be a Web service.  I don't trust
my emails to assorted Web services.  In fact, I think it may violate
FERPA if I do [3,4].  But it's a good idea to put my mailing lists to
the side, or at least some of them.  One of the "services" that the College
imposes upon me puts the phrase "[Bulk Mail]" before all of my mailing
lists.  I could write a mailbox rule to move those to a folder to look
at at the end of the day (or when I want).

Let's see ... It took about thirty minutes to achieve "inbox three",
although that included writing the paragraphs above and sending a few
messages at the start of the day.  Is that good?  I don't know.

I will admit it was depressing that once I got out of a meeting to
discuss the design of a spring class, I had accumulated another forty
or so messages to clean through.

But I ended the day with inbox zero.  I even managed to read the important
articles in _Chronicle_ and the Straight Dope, and to have a few interesting
email conversations with folks.

Inbox zero, day two.  Saturday.  It looks like less mail comes in on
weekends.  But there's still some.

Okay, I know I unsubscribed to some of these advertisements.  Why do
they keep coming?  Oh, yeah, "It may take seven days, or, in some cases,
as many as ten days, to process your request."  I know that one of our
alums [5] explained it to me once, but I don't remember.  Oh well.  I'll
wait.

Inbox zero, day three.  Sunday.  It's been remarkably easy to stay at
at inbox zero, but that's probably because I get less email over the weekend,
and this weekend is a long weekend, so I may get even less.  

The inbox cleanup is affecting other kinds of computer usage, too.
I spent some of today reducing desktop clutter (from 200+ items to 15,
which is about as few as I can deal with).

Unfortunately, I'm having trouble doing the same level of reduction
in the physical world.  I went to the Friends book sort, and brought
home too many books.  I rescued Jon Dos Passos' USA Trilogy in paperback
from our "throw out" bin.  I don't need it, but I may sneak it back into
the bookstore.  Someone should want to read Dos Passos.  I picked up and
paid for _Getting Things Done_ (friends have been telling me to read it),
_Thinking Fast and Slow_ (on my long-term reading list), and _As You
Wish --- Inconceivable Talkes from the Making of The Princess Bride_
(just because).  I did *not* pick up an extra copy of David Feldman's
_Imponderables_, since I own it already.  I grabbed a copy of _Snowcrash_
for a student.  And I grabbed a book for Michelle.  So I think I have
to find three books to get rid of.  I did put fifteen books in the
"get rid of" pile yesterday.  I wonder if that counts?  Probably not [6].

But this is supposed to be about keeping my inbox at zero, not about
keeping my bookshelves at below capacity.  So, I'll note that the project
is going well.  We'll see how weekdays go, as well as how the start of
the semester goes.

[1] Or, rather, I'm not planning on writing it in one day.

[2] Can you tell that I'm planing ahead for when I don't have time or
energy to write a full essay?

[3] Grinnell had to designate Microsoft as an "Officer of the College"
so that they could store our email.

[4] However, I'm told that it's absolutely fine that Proofpoint looks
at our email and even stores some of it on their servers.  That makes
no sense to me.

[5] The legendary ErynO, I believe.

[6] The three books I got rid of: Volume 2 of _The Walking Dead_, which
I'm not sure how I ended up with, and which I'll never read; _Fables
Book 1: Legends in Exile_, which seems to be a spare copy and can go to
the CS commons [7]; and _Sources of Early Christian Thought: The Trinitarian
Controversy_, which I'll offer to Middle Son [8].

[7] That reminds me, I also picked up a copy of _Reading Code: The Open
Source Perspective_ for the CS library.

[8] I'm not sure that passing books on to my kids counts as getting rid
of them, but it's a start [9,10].

[9] Early in my married life, my brother-in-law and I would trade boxes
of books back and forth so that we could each tell people that we were 
getting rid of books.  

[10] I might end up passing _Thinking Fast and Slow_ on to eldest.  It
seems like his type of book.

Misnaming
=========

*Topics/Tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

The other day, I was chatting with Andi Tracy on Facebook and I
asked myself, "I wonder how often people end up addressing her as
Andy Traci?" While that's a bit of a facetious question, it did get
me thinking about common or potential misnamings I encounter (or
might encounter) at Grinnell.

Paul Hutchison appears to be the most common case I encounter.  I'd
swear I hear people refer to him as "Paul Hutchi**n**son" more than
I hear people use his real name.  I guess he's learned to put up
with it.  I assume that Jackie has the same problem, but I seem to
encounter it less.

While I don't hear people mispronounce Jerod Weinman's name, I do
see them misspell it regularly.  If I recall, Jared seems to be the
mort common, but I'm sure there are others.

I know that David Lopatto prefers to be referred to as "David", but 
surprisingly many abbreviate it to "Dave".  I've even found myself
doing the same.

I wonder how often the scientific Leslies [1] encounter the spelling
of the artistic Lesleys [2] and vice versa.

I think people pronounce Dean Bakopoulos' name correctly, but I've
also heard that the correctness does not carry through to the
spelling.  I'd think that would be one that people would look up
to be sure [3], but what do I know?  Life would be so much easier
if he just changed his last name to Nutting [4].

Postscript: My muse insists that I try to write something about how
John Garrison experiences a misspelling of his last name as "Rommereim",
or vide versa.  But she hasn't given me a good idea on how to phrase
that issue.  I do worry that there are times that her sense of humor
is even worse than mine.

Postscript: I intended this musing as something a bit lighter than
the recent thoughts about retention and graduation rights, or even
the complexities of preregistration.  But names are important, so I'm
not sure I chose the right topic.

[1] Gregg-Jolly and Lyons.

[2] Delmenico and Wright.

[3] That's certainly waht I do.

[4] That was intended as a joke, a play on the regular demand that
women change their names.

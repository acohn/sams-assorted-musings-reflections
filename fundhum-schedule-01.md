A revised draft schedule for the new "digital humanities" CSC 151
=================================================================

*Topics/tags: [CSC151](index-151), Racket, digital humanities, teaching, short*

About a month ago, I put together [a draft schedule for the course
tentatively entitled _A Functional Approach to Digital Humanities_
(_FunDHum_)](fundhum-schedule-00).  As I continue to make slow progress
on writing the testbook for _FunDHum_, I find myself naturally thinking
about revising the topics I will cover and the order in which I will
cover them.  That is, although the proposed schedule influences what 
topics I address and how I address them, addressing those topics also
leads me to revise the schedule.

Here's the original draft of the schedule ("draft 0", in my parlance).

Recently, I've been thinking about two particular changes to that schedule.

First, I've realized that I want to include dictionaries (hash tables) in
the course; they prove useful for many too many things to leave them out.
If I recall correctly, writing the [draft of the first version of the
final project](fundhum-project-00) led me to think about the need for
hash tables.

Second, as I wrote a new set of materials on evaluating expressions,
I found that evaluation really seemed to need a day of its own.

_Issues to address_: A second day on procedures and order of evaluation,
or maybe just about evaluation.  A day on hash tables.

* _Step one_: Combine Booleans and conditionals.  _Step two_: Add
hash tables to vectors (ouch!).
* _Other issues_: Move structures earlier.  Reflect on Friday topics.
* _Missing_: I/O.  Pauses for breath other than "Discuss exam".

Here's the new version [1].

Is this the final version of the schedule?  Probably not.  But it should
serve for a few more weeks of writing.

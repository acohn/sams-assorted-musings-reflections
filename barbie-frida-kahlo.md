Really thin arms!

And look, there's a controversy

Beyond that, I found myself reflecting on the following paragraph.

> Pinedo’s mother, Isolda P. Kahlo, was Frida Kahlo’s niece and inherited the artist’s industrial property rights. In 2003, Isolda P. Kahlo gave her daughter power of attorney over her affairs, and the following year Pinedo transferred Frida Kahlo’s industrial property rights to the newly formed FKC “with the goal of commercializing the ‘Frida Kahlo’ brand,” the corporation’s complaint explains.

Do they mean "industrial property" or "intellectual property"?

The Association
===============

*Topics/tags: [Reviews](index-reviews), music*

The other day, I went with Michelle and some friends to see The
Association.  I will admit that it would not have been a concert that
I would have decided to attend on my own, while there are a few songs
by the Association that I really enjoy, such as "Along Comes Mary"
and "Windy", they aren't songs that are particularly meaningful to me.
I also tend to prefer bands that continued to make new music or at least
whose individual members continued to make new music.

Nontheless, it was a fun concert, and I'm glad I went.  While are only
two original members left, most of the other members have been there a
long time, so they cohere well as a band.  They can't quite hit all of
the harmonies of years gone by, but they come close.  And they clearly
have fun with what they do; they tell stories, laugh at each others,
and interact with the audience [1].

They claimed that they have three of the [100 most played songs of the
previous century](https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/232893), including 
"Never My Love" (which beat out "Yesterday" for the second slot), "Cherish"
at the number 22 slot, and "Windy" at number 61.  That's almost as many 
songs as the Beatles have in that list [2].  

But what does a band do when they have about half a dozen hits that
people remember and not much history beyond, say, the early 1970's?
They played a funny song (a version of the Eagles' "Desperado" that
they renamed "Avacado"), a song I hadn't known that had clear Iowa ties
("Dubuque Blues"), and, well, a whole bunch of cover versions, including
an attempt a bunch of the songs from the soundtrack of _The Big Chill_
[3].  They did a great version of "Wouldn't It Be Nice" with most of
the harmonies intact.  And they did a surprisingly good version of
"The Weight" [4].

Here are some highlights of the show, at least from my perspective.

* Michelle telling the person next to her that "'Cherish' is almost as
  much of a creepy stalker song as 'Happy Together'" [5].  It still
  makes me laugh.
* Their cover of "The Weight".  I still don't know what it means, but
  I love that song.
* The middle-aged woman in front of us bopping along to songs.
* And, believe it or not, but it was fun to hear "Along Comes Mary" live.

The folks who were with me were sad that the band never played "Requiem
For The Masses".  Maybe next time.

[1] Okay, maybe they just pretend to have fun with what they do.  If that's
the case, they fake it well enough that it's okay with me.  I've been to
too many shows in which the band seems to be just going through the motions.

[2] "Yesterday" at number 3, "Something" at number 17, "Michelle"
at number 42, and "Let It Be" at number 89.  Lennon's "Image" is at
number 96.

[3] There appear to be a wide variety of soundtracks to _The Big Chill_.
Most include The Exciters' "Tell Him" and Procol Harum's "A White Shade
of Pale", and The Rascals' "Good Lovin", none of which The Association
Covered.

[4] Whenever I hear "The Weight", I feel like I can close my eyes and
see the scene from _The Last Waltz_ when they sing it.  I still love
the movie, but Reading Levon Helm's description of the making of _The 
Last Waltz_ made me see it in a new light.

[5] How else would you interpret the line "You don't know how many times
I've wished I could mold you into someone who could cherish me as much
as I cherish you"?

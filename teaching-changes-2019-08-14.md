Changes in my teaching
======================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), writing, teaching, bragging*

The other day, one of my children shared [a podcast with Kumail
Nanjiani '01](https://radiopublic.com/inside-the-hive-with-nick-bilton-8599vo/ep/s1!377c8)
and said, "Dad, he mentions you at about 57:20".

Now, for those who haven't been paying attention, Kumail was both
a CS major [1] and a Philosophy major [2].  For some reason, Kumail
ended up being my advisee.  Kumail and I started at Grinnell the
same year, so I've always considered myself one of the class of '01
[3].  As I mentioned in [an earlier musing](things-we-lose-2019-07-25),
he even did summer research with me and came along to a conference.
Kumail was also in two classes, CSC 152, what was then the second
course in the introductory CS sequence, and CSC 323.

CSC 152 was a crammed course: Students learned Java (after they just
finished Scheme), data structures, algorithms, some object-oriented
design, and more.  Java was a simpler language then [7], so I got deeper
into algorithms and analysis then than I do now in CSC 207 [8].  The
class had a weekly group programming projects and, to make things
more fun, I asked each group to write a short essay on what they
learned in the project.

But it's me.  I tend to have more things to do than I have time to
complete them, particularly when I'm in the midst of teaching three
courses as well as running an independent study project with nine
students [9].  And so I did not get much of the grading done, other
than the exams [10].  On the last week of class, I finally gave up
and said "grade your own homework".  I'm pretty sure that no one
gave themselves anything higher than a B.  And, well, I got perfect
end-of-course ratings.  The students in that class taught me that
I should assign difficult work and it didn't matter whether or not
I graded it.

CSC 223 was our software design course [11].  Kumail was in a group that
designed an IMAP-based mail reader [12].  They had a great name for
it, "You've got mail: Kumail" [14].  I almost certainly had them
write a project report, although I can't recall what my requirements
[15] were.

Okay, you now have the context for Kumail's comment about me.  Let's
see what he said [16].

> I just had a couple thoughts.  One.  You know "memes" is an interesting
thing, obviously.  It's sort of a shared meaning and it's created
by a community and I see the positive aspect of it.  But, like, all
the responses of GIFs and stuff.  I'm going to sound like such
a fuddy duddy, but I think people are getting worse and worse at
expressing themselves.  I think language separates us from f*cking
animals and people are getting worse and worse at it.  People speak
in the same phrases.  They reference the same memes.  They use the
same GIFs.  You know, Michael Jackson eating that popcorn or whatever
and the first time you see it, you're like "clever".

> Another computer science professor, Sam Rebelsky, at Grinnell:
He wanted us to write papers about algorithms and this kind of
stuff.  And his thing was like "Do not use any phrases.  Don't use
cliché phrases.  I don't want people to say 'suffice it to say'.
Find your own way to say it."  Or that kind of stuff.  And he really
would dock a third of a grade if you'd use a phrase that was a sort
of autopilot phrase.  And that made me really aware of how many
times I speak in ways that are, you know, [Nick Bilton interjects
"Like everyone else"] like everyone else.  And I think these GIFs
are like an extreme version of that. [17]

My first reaction was "I don't recall any of that. He must be
thinking of someone else; perhaps it was John Stone or Elizabeth
Dobbs."  But then I thought a bit more.   I certainly had students
write about algorithms.  I've been known to be a picky grader.  And
"you lose a third of a grade for X" has been one of my standard
approaches to grading.  But clichés?  I can't remember disallowing
them.  And, I must admit, I use many clichés in my own writing, or
at least my own musing [18].  I know that "use of clichés" has not 
been on my Tutorial grading rubric [19].

Nonetheless, I can believe that there was a point at which I came
back from a Grinnell teaching seminar thinking more carefully about
such issues and, at that time, I may have made them a focus.  It may
also be that Kumail is conflating things: I certainly do comment when
students use pointless clichés and, as I noted earlier, I have been
known to take off a third of a letter grade when a student exhibits
a repeated writing problem.  Would I disallow clichés today?  Not
explicitly.  But, in reviewing a paper with a student, I would likely
discuss some of the more obvious ones.

As importantly, as my latest crop of CSC 151 and CSC 207 students
will tell you, I remain quite picky [20] when I grade.  I know that
many of my CSC 151 students were frustrated that I asked them to
write detailed preconditions and postconditions and took off points
if they did not meet reasonable standards.  I also know that some
of my CSC 207 students were frustrated that I did not give credit
for programs that did not pass the unit tests I provided.  However,
as I told them, Boeing and may others have shown the difficulty of
relying on software that isn't completely thought through.

I began this musing planning to write on how much I seem to have
changed since I started teaching at Grinnell.  I ended by realizing
that the key characteristics to my grading are similar: I don't
grade everything and, when I do, I tend to be quite picky.  Oh well,
I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same.  Or
is that too much of a cliché?

[1] For his parents.

[2] For himself.

[3] Thanks to Vivek [4], I'm now an honorary member of that class [5].

[4] Rhymes with "like cake".

[5] Did you know that alumni relations doesn't keep track of honorary
class members [6]?  That's sad.

[6] No, I am not saying that to imply that I made up my honorary
membership.  It's more that I am sad that they don't track such
things.

[7] If I recall correctly, Java did not have generics back then.  It
also did not have anonymous inner classes or lambda expressions.  I like
all of these additions, but they certainly complicate what we teach.

[8] I'm glad to see that we've finally reintroduced graphs and
recurrence relations to CSC 207; I considered them key parts of
152.

[9] What's the difference between "an independent study with nine students"
and "a small seminar"?  You can compensated for the latter, but not the
former.

[10] Yes, I know this sounds familiar.  Stay tuned.

[11] Its successors were CSC 323 (same course, new number), CSC 325
(an alternate with more of a focus on Web development), CSC 321/322
(a new version of the course split into two halves), and CSC 324/326
(CSC 321 and CSC 322 combined into a single course, with a 2-credit
option in subsequent semesters).

[12] This was in 2000 or 2001.  Writing an IMAP-based mail reader was
a big deal.  Perhaps it still is.

[14] I'm pretty sure that revealing the project name does not violate
FERPA restrictions.

[15] In the first draft of this musing, I wrote "demands" rather than
"requirements".  I suppose that says something about how I think of them.

[16] Or at least let's see my attempt to transcribe what he said.

[18] I've already written about [one cliché I tend to overuse](a-number-of).
I'm sure that there are many more.

[19] That reminds me; I need to think about when I can teach Tutorial
again and what its subject will be.

[20] Some students would say "overly picky".

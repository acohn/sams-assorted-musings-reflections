Someone else's musings
======================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta), language, music*

When I started writing "SamR's Assorted Musings and Rants", I referred to
the pieces I wrote each days as "essays".  However, as some of my readers
liked to point out, many of these works cannot readily be classified as
essays.  Hence, at some point or other, I started to call them "musings"
and to refer to the action of writing them as "musing".  That is, I muse.
Of course, I also use the term "muse" to refer to that invisible actor
who helps guide me in what to write (muse) about.

It used to be that every time I asked Grammarly to edit my writing, it
would criticize my use of those terms [1].  I ignored the suggestions;
I'm perfectly comfortable with the nouns and verbs.  But I found myself
wondering how atypical my usage was.

Today, I received a message that referred to another writer's works as
musings: "Download the Great Unreleased Trove of Pop Musings".  That 
made me happy.   It's nice to be reminded that I am not the only person
who thinks of some kinds of writings as "musings".

What?  You want to know what "the Great Unreleased Trove of Pop Musings"
is?  As is too often the case, there's a bit of backstory.

I listen to many genres of music.  At some periods of my life, I've
been particularly fond of a genre that its fans refer to as "Power Pop".
My shorthand description is "the power of the Who with the melody of the
Beatles" [2].  However, power pop encompasses a much wider range of music
than that [3].  In any case, it's a genre I like and, at times, a genre
I've collected.

Back when I was in graduate school, I heard on NPR about a book that had
just been released that was about power pop [5].  In those pre-Amazon [6]
days, if you wanted a book, you went to your local bookstore.  So I
went to the UofC bookstore to find a copy [7].  Of course, they didn't
have a copy.  And they seemed unable to order a copy from anywhere.

Years passed.  I started buying CDs from a label called "Not Lame", run
by Bruce Brodeen, a former resident of Needham, MA.  And, once in a while,
they released a new book about power pop.  They may have even re-released
the book I'd missed.  But running a music label and [mail order
catalog](http://www.popgeekheaven.com/the-absolutely-complete-not-lame-printed-mail-order-catalog-collection)
is hard, particularly when you get sued for selling an album that you
didn't press [8].  In early 2010 or so, Brodeen stopped running`Not Lame.
But the music biz is hard to give up on, and he's kept releasing the
occasional thing.

One of his latest forthcoming releases is the second edition of John
Borack's _Shake Some Action_, a list of the top power pop releases of
all times [10].  When Bruce releases something, he likes to share
"extras" with the people who purchase it even before it is released [11].
One of the extras from _Shake Some Action_ is a collection of things
that Borack and others wrote for the first edition of the book but that
didn't meet the cut.  Here's the full statement.

> Author John M. Borack has done truly amazing work documenting the history of 'power pop' over the last 25 years and way back in the '00s, when work was being done on the first "Shake Some Action" book, he gathered up a huge trove of material to be considered for that volume.  Alas, there was only so much room to fit everything in and keep the scope of the core focus on to the Top 200 releases - which meant there was a lot of fascinating, interesting and really good material that was impossible to include.  Now, 11 years later, you can enjoy a veritable mini-book of these excerpts as a bonus here and as a reward for your incredibly good taste in all things pop.

> Cool, yes?  Why 'yes', actually.

> Download the Great Unreleased Trove of Pop Musings [12].

And there you have it.  Another use of the word "musing" to describe
a piece of writing.  It makes me happy.  It also makes me happy that
the trove includes a piece on the history of Chicago Power Pop.  However,
it doesn't include the Insiders' "Ghost on the Beach", so I'm not sure
how trustworthy it is.

Postscript: This musing reminds me that I owe Middle Son another
compilation tape.  Perhaps I'll make one that focuses on some of my
favorite Power Pop songs.  I could start with "International Pop
Overthrow" by Material Issue, even though it's not my favorite of their
songs.  I'll need to include "I Want You Back" by the Hoodoo Gurus
and ....

[1] Surprisingly, it does not seem to do so as much any more.

[2] I suppose that description no longer makes sense to many of my
readers.

[3] I tend to list the Plimsouls, the Hoodoo Gurus, the Wishniaks,
Material Issue, the Distractions, and the Bad Examples [4] as among my
favorite practitioners of the genre.  I also appreciate many other power
pop bands, from big names like Cheap Trick to more obscure acts like
Paul Chastain.

[4] I don't generally think of the Bad Examples as power pop.  But some
of their albums get listed in power-pop "best of" lists, so I'll
include them.

[5] Unfortunately, I don't recall the name.

[6] And, effectively, per InterWeb 

[7] I'm not sure why I didn't go the Seminary Coop.

[8] I can't find a link right now.  If I recall
correctly, Brodeen sold some compilation album, not [Yellow
Pills](https://www.amazon.com/Yellow-Pills-Best-American-Pop/dp/B000000IBF)
[9], but something even more sketchy, and one of the bands on the album
objected to the use of their song without their permission.  They sued
not the people who had made the record, but the mail-order company
(Not Lame records) that was selling some copies.

[9] Damn.  In searching for "Yellow Pills", I see
that I missed the publication of a [Yellow Pills
book](https://www.facebook.com/YellowPillsPowerPop).  It appears to
be out of print.

[10] Or at least from 1970 to 2017.

[11] Yes, that means I pre-ordered a copy.  Sorry Micki!

[12] No, I won't provide a link.  That seems unethical.

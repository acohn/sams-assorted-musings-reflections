Someone else's musings
======================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta), language, music*

When I started writing "SamR's Assorted Musings and Rants", I referred to
the pieces I wrote each days as "essays".  But they aren't really essays.
So at some point or other, I started to call them "musings" and to refer
to the action of writing them as "musing".  That is, I muse.  Of course,
I also use the term "muse" to refer to that invisible actor who helps
guide me in what to write (muse) about.

It used to be that every time I asked Grammarly to edit my writing, it
would criticize my use of those terms [1].  I ignored the suggestions;
I'm perfectly comfortable with the nouns and verbs.  But I found myself
wondering how atypical my usage was.

Today, I received a message that referred to another writer's works as
musings: "Download the Great Unreleased Trove of Pop Musings".  That 
made me happy.  

What's the context?  Some backstory may be necessary.

I listen to many genres of music.  At some periods of my life, I've
been particularly fond of a genre that its fans refer to as "Power Pop".
My shorthand description is "the power of the Who with the melody of the
Beatles".  However, power pop encompasses a much wider range of music [2].

Back when I was in graduate school, I heard on NPR about a book that had
just been released that was about power pop [4].  In those pre-Amazon
[5] days, if you wanted a book, you went to your local bookstore.  So I
went to the UofC bookstore to find a copy [6].  Of course, they didn't
have a copy.  And they seemed unable to order a copy from anywhere.

Years passed.  I started buying CDs from a label called "Not Lame",
run by Bruce Brodeen, a former resident of Needham, MA.  And, once in
a while, they released a new book about
power pop.  I think they even re-released the
book I'd missed.  But running a music label and [mail order
catalog](http://www.popgeekheaven.com/the-absolutely-complete-not-lame-printed-mail-order-catalog-collection)
is hard, particularly when you get sued for selling an album that you
didn't press [7].  In early 2010 or so, Brodeen stopped running`Not Lame.
But the music biz is hard to give up on, and he's kept releasing the
occasional thing.

One of his latest forthcoming releases is the second edition of _Shake
Some Action_, a list of the top power pop releases of the past N decades.
And when Bruce releases something, he likes to share "extras" with the
people who purchase.  One of the extras from _Shake Some Action_ is
a collection of things ...

No, I won't provide a link

[1] Surprisingly, it does not seem to do so as much any more.

[2] I tend to list the Plimsouls, the Hoodoo Gurus, the Wishniaks,
Material Issue, the Distractions, and the Bad Examples [3] as among my
favorite practitioners of the genre.  I also apprciate many other power
pop bands, from big names like Cheap Trick to more obscure acts like
Paul Chastain.

[3] I don't generally think of the Bad Examples as power pop.  But some
of their albums get listed in power-pop "best of" lists, so I'll
include them.

[4] Unfortunately, I don't recall the name.

[5] And, effectively, per InterWeb 

[6] I'm not sure why I didn't go

[7] I can't find a link right now.  If I recall
correctly, Brodeen sold some compilation album, not [Yellow
Pills](https://www.amazon.com/Yellow-Pills-Best-American-Pop/dp/B000000IBF)
[8], but something even more sketchy, and one of the bands on the album
objected to the use of their song without their permission.  They sued
not the people who had made the record, but the mail-order company
(Not Lame records) that was selling some copies.

[8] Damn.  In searching for "Yellow Pills", I see that I missed the
publication of a [Yellow Pills book](https://www.facebook.com/YellowPillsPowerPop).

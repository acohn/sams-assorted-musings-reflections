One drive, many steps
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), technology, short*

Recently, someone shared a group of files with me on Microsoft OneDrive.
The message I received included a link to a shared folder.  I wanted to
download all of the files to my laptop.  However, while I could select
all of the files, no download button was available or obvious.  I tried
asking one of the more technically savvy people downstairs from me [1].
They didn't know either.  I figured if they didn't know, it wasn't possible.

But that's strange, isn't it?  Every other cloud storage service I use [2]
seems to have a mechanism for downloading a folder.  Why doesn't OneDrive?

I thought I'd figured out a solution.  I downloaded the OneDrive application
for Mac, started that application, and went through the multi-step log in
process.  I got a OneDrive folder on my Mac along with the subfolders I
expected.  But the shared folder didn't appear there.  My eventual hack
was to create a subfolder, then go to the shared folder online and copy
the files to that new subfolder.  That didn't seem like the most
efficient way to download a bunch of files, but it was better than
downloading each one individually.

Eventually, I decided to call the ITS help desk [3].  The first
person I spoke with said "I don't use OneDrive" and helpfully passed
me on to one of the back-room people who know much more about such
things.  They told me that the only way to do a group download was
to use Internet Explorer, which doesn't seem to be a possibility
on my Mac.  They agreed.  And it sounded like there was not much
more I could do.

Then I mentioned the strategy I was using: "I tried using OneDrive
on Mac, but that didn't show the folder that was shared with me."
The helpful person at ITS asked, "Did you try using 'Sync'?"  I
tried.  OneDrive made me log in again.  Then it complained that I
was already logged in.  Somewhere along the way, I also ended up
with two copies of OneDrive on my computer.

But I eventually ended up with a folder with the shared files.  It
wasn't where I expected it to be.  My files were in a folder called
"One Drive - Grinnell College" [4].  The shared files were in a
folder called "One Drive - _Other Person_ - _Shared Folder_" [5]
in the parent directory of my OneDrive folder.  Not where I'd think
to look.  And, of course, the files weren't really there; if I
double-clicked on a file name, I had to wait a bit for it to appear,
since OneDrive only downloads a file when you need it [6].  I think
that's a good feature.

So, it appears that once I've set things up correctly, there's a natural
way to "download" all of the files.  It's not as easy as, say, a download
button would be.  Nonetheless, as I said, it's better than downloading
individual files one by one.

Still, I'm left with at least two outstanding questions.

1. Now that I've downloaded my files, how do I turn off the OneDrive 
application?

2. What do workflows look like at Microsoft that they make it so hard
to do something so natural?

I traditionally refer to SharePoint as SharePointlees.  I need a similar
nickname for OneDrive.  OneDriveManySteps is a possibility, but it's a
bit too long.  Do my readers have any suggestions?

[1] Arguably, all five people downstairs are more technically savvy
than me, particularly with regards to Microsoft products.

[2] Let's see ... Google Drive, Box, DropBox, Mega, and a few more that
I can't recall, but that friends have asked me to use from time to time.

[3] I will admit that I did so with an intention to support this musing:
"I called ITS; they didn't have any suggestions, either."

[4] I didn't name it.  OneDrive did.

[5] You can substitute in the name of the other person

[6] That's a feature, not a bug.

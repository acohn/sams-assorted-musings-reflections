In [a recent musing](post-prereg-2020S), I noted that those with
funds might consider donating to support the academic program and
even suggested that folks donate to name the Global Kitchen after
Todd Armstrong and/or John and Joan Mohan.   That got me thinking.
If alumni [1] wanted to donate in my name, what would I like them
to donate?  There are so many possibilities.  I realize that none
of these would really happen, but it’s fun to fantasize.

At the high end, a professorship or two would be nice.  A Professorship
in CS in Computing and Society or Computing and the Arts would be
cool, and would reflect things I do and value.  One could also
support a more general “Computing and …” professorship.  Of course,
I’ve long suggested that we create a new kind of endowed professorship,
similar to the Claire Booth Luce professorships, that is given to
pre-tenure faculty and is reserved for people traditionally
underrepresented in their (science) discipline.  It would be cool
to know that my name was being used to diversify our faculty [2].
A “Samuel Rebelsky professor of Studio Art” would also be wicked
neat as would a “Rebelsky Professor of Jewish Studies” [3].

Another potential high-end donation would be to name the HSSC.  We
have a Bucksbaum Center for the Arts, a Rosenfield (Student) Center,
and a Noyce Science Center.  Why not a Rebelsky Humanities and
Social Studies Center?

Now, let's suppose you don't have quite that much money.  What are
the large, but not insanely large, donation opportunities?  One
focus of my time at Grinnell has been building community in CS.
Since the CS commons is the center of the CS community, it would
be cool to have it named after me.  The same holds for the CS
learning center.

Of course, I have broader interests beyond CS.  Naming the food
bank after the Rebelskys would do tribute not just to me, but also
to Michelle, Freda and Bill, and my kids.  Endowing the mental
health fund in our name would also be wonderful, if perhaps a bit
more costly.  I certainly would not object to having my name
associated with the Digital Studio or the Wood shop in Studio Art.

I should note that the largest gift Michelle and I made to the
College was to create a fund for broadening participation in CS.
I don’t think we ever officially named it, and we certainly didn’t
associate our names with it.  But I’m thrilled that the department
now has such a fund and that others are donating to it.

Of course, it’s possible to donate much less and still do so in
honor of someone.  It took me until this year to realize that I
could add “[In honor of](honor-giving-grinnell-2020-01-03" to my
regular donations to the College, and it was fun doing so.  Where
would I recommend donating?  I'd suggest that you donate to a part
of Grinnell that is meaningful to you.

I'll admit that we're not consistent in how we donate.  We’ve given
money to CS [5], Math/Stats, Studio Art, Theatre and Dance,
Anthropology [6], Chemistry, and perhaps one or two other departments.
We like to support our student athletes, so we’ve given to the Swim
& Dive team, the Football team, one or both of the Soccer teams,
and the Volleyball team [7].  We’ve tried to support a few student
groups, including Grinnell Singers and the Catholic Student Association
We also donate to the food bank, the mental health fund, something
or other in the Institute for Global Engagement, and some other
funds.  We also give to the General Fund.  I've probably missed a
few; as I said, we're not all that consistent.

I hope seeing the list has inspired you.  Please donate.  I don't
recall care whether or not you donate in my name.  I just care that
you help support some part of this institution that I love.

[1] Or others

[2] If you’d prefer to donate such a professorship in someone else’s name, that would be great, too.

[3] Admittedly, a Kasimov Professor would make more sense.

[4] That’s not to say that we don’t donate regularly; we just committed to a five-year set of donations for this particular purpose.

[5] Both the general fund and the BPC fund.

[6] Yes, there’s a story there.

[7] I should plan a gift to our Ultimate teams, too. Huge numbers of students that I value belong or have belonged to those teams.

Tomorrow I will post my thousandth musing or rant [1,2].  As I've
been getting closer and closer to that deadline, I've found myself
reflecting on what to call that musing.

"Musing 1000" is a bit boring.  It is a kind of milestone, so that provides
one possible title, albeit with different variants.  "A milestone."  "My
latest milestone."  Of course, the part of my brain that likes puns [3] 
always turns "milestone" into "millstone".

Now that I've written those descriptions, I find myself wondering
whether either of those metaphors make sense.  As I understand the
words, a milestone is a kind of achievement and a millstone is a
significant burden.  Let's see what the Interweb [4] says.  Depressingly
enough, the first result of my search is the "Milestone Gold Master
Card" and the second is Milestone Systems, which appears to be a 
provider of video management software [7].  Fortunately, the things I
am looking for appear next.

Merriam-Webster [8] online provides the following definition:

> 1 : a stone serving as a milepost (see milepost sense 1)

> 2 : a significant point in development // Graduating from college was an important *milestone* in her life.

The latter matches my intent.  So far, so good.

Now let's turn to "millstone".  I no longer trust Interweb searches, so I'm
just going to search within Merriam-Webster online.  But the first result
is not promising.

> **504 Gateway Time-out**

Have I mentioned how much I hate computers?

Strangely enough, a Interweb search for "millstone" does allow me
to reach the Merriam-Webster page.  Things did not look promising
on the search results page, which indicates only "either of two
circular stones used for grinding something (such as grain)".  However,
the second definition is the one I was looking for.

> 2 a : something that grinds or crushes

> b : a heavy burden

> Examples of millstone in a Sentence \\ College loans can quickly become a *millstone* for students.  

Now, I don't really think of the musings as a millstone; I enjoy musing.  But
I must admit that there are some musings that feel a bit like millstones,
including [my most-recent post-prereg musing](post-prereg-2020S).

Of course, that punny part of my brain now wants to change "millstone" into
Millistone".

Alternate titles. Up to
four digits. Millimusing. Or is that kilomusing. Adding another
digit. A milestone (or is that millstone or perhaps millistone or
even kilo stone.).

An alum passed this along, <https://xkcd.com/1000/>, which includes
the same concept I was tihnking of.  "Wow - Just 24 to go until a
big round-number filestone".

[1] At least I plan to post my thousandth musing or rant tomorrow.  I suppose
something could happen that prevents me from doing so.  Or maybe my muse will
tell me to take a day off.  But the odds are good that I will post the musing
tomorrow.

[2] It should be a musing, not a rant.  

[3] Perhaps that's all of my brain.

[4] Should that be "InterWeb" or perhaps "interweb".  The former
follows the computing world's tendency to use CamelCase.  The latter
is in keeping with the [horrendous AP decision to stop treating
Internet as a proper
noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization_of_Internet)
[5]?  CamelCase feels too much like a product [6].  And you can tell
how I feel about the decision to treat Internet as other than a proper
noun.  I'll stick with "Interweb".

[5] Why does the Wikipedia article begin with "This article relies
too much on references to primary sources"?  Shouldn't you preliminary
rely on primary sources?  I'm so confused.

[6] I guess the Interweb is a product of sorts.

[7] Perhaps I should rethink my capitalization of Interweb.

[8] With regards to [my somewhat recent musing on misnaming](misnaming-2019-12-08), I wonder how often that's misspelled as "Marian-Webster", or something similar.

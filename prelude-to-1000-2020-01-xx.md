Tomorrow I will post my thousandth musing or rant [1,2,3].  As I've
been getting closer and closer to that deadline, I've found myself
reflecting on what to call that musing.

"Musing 1000" is a bit boring.  It is a kind of milestone, so that provides
one possible title, albeit with different variants.  "A milestone."  "My
latest milestone."  Of course, the part of my brain that likes puns [4] 
always turns "milestone" into "millstone".

Now that I've written those words, I find myself wondering whether
either of those metaphors make sense.  As I understand the words,
a milestone is a kind of achievement and a millstone is a significant
burden.  Let's see what the Interweb [5] says.  Depressingly enough,
the first result of my search is the "Milestone Gold Master Card"
and the second is Milestone Systems, which appears to be a provider
of video management software [9].  Fortunately, the kinds of things
I am looking for appear next.

Merriam-Webster [10] online provides the following definition:

> 1 : a stone serving as a milepost (see milepost sense 1)

> 2 : a significant point in development // Graduating from college was an important *milestone* in her life.

The latter matches my understanding and intent.  So far, so good.

Now let's turn to "millstone".  I no longer trust Interweb searches,
so I'm just going to search within Merriam-Webster online.  However,
the first result is far from promising.

> **504 Gateway Time-out**

Have I mentioned how much I hate computers?

Strangely enough, an Interweb search for "millstone" does allow me
to reach the Merriam-Webster page.  Things did not look promising
on the search results page, which indicated only "either of two
circular stones used for grinding something (such as grain)".  I
suppose the musings crush somebody [11].  But my musings are not
circular stones, at least in any way I can find to interpret [12]
the words.  However, the second definition, which appears only on
the M-W page, is the one I was looking for.

> 2 a : something that grinds or crushes

> b : a heavy burden

> Examples of millstone in a Sentence \\ College loans can quickly become a *millstone* for students.  

Now, I don't really think of the musings as a millstone; I enjoy musing.  But
I must admit that there are some musings that feel a bit like millstones,
including [my most-recent post-prereg musing](post-prereg-2020S).

Of course, that punny part of my brain now wants to change "millstone"
into Millistone".  Is that correct?  Milli comes from the Latin
"_mille_", which means "one thousand". But it strikes me that "milli"
is more frequently used to mean "one thousand*th*", as in "millimeter"
and "millilitre" [14].  The "kilo" prefix tends to mean "one thousand".
But changing "millstone" into "kilostone" doesn't make much sense.  I
also expect that a kilostone represents a unit of mass that's about
seven tons [15,16].  That's definitely a heavy burden.  Is that what
a millstone weights?  [The first source I found on the Interweb](http://hudsonvalleygeologist.blogspot.com/2014/12/how-much-does-millstone-weigh.html)
suggests that each millstone weighs under a ton.

Wait!  In some cases, "milli" is used to mean "one thousand" rather 
"one thousandth", such as in "millennium", or one thousand years [17].
So I could call my next musing my "millimusing".  I suppose that would
tempt me to keep it small.  Perhaps "kilomusing".  Or is that
"kill a musing"?  I know that some people would like to eliminate
some of my musings.  And neither "kilo" nor "milli" is strictly correct,
since some of the one-thousand postings have been rants and others
were labeled as "essays".

Of course, I'm a computer scientist, of sorts, so my "kilomusing" or
"kilopost" or whatever should really be my 1024th and numbered 1023.
But I didn't start at zero and I'd still like to celebrate the
more traditional thousandth anniversary.  I guess I could call it
"only twenty-four more to go", or something like that.

On that note, part of me considered calling it "my final musing".
But it's unlikely that I will stop writing.  Still, I could have
chosen that name and then revealed that I was renaming the pieces
I write.  Such an attempt would have been more appropriate for the
spring day in which I often wear a Tigger costume [18].

I have trouble stopping when I start thinking about these kinds of
alternatives, so I also considered discussing how I represent the
number of the musing: "Up to four digits", "Adding another digit".

If I logged the time per musing, I could have named it in relation
to that effort: "A half a year of full-time work down the drain",
or something like that [19].  But the "drain" metaphor doesn't
really work.  Perhaps "the product of ..." or "... and what do I
have to show for it?"  But I have something to show for it.  Words.
Lots and lots of words: endnotes and postscripts and puns, oh my.
Hey!  That's a good potential title.  You just have to envision
Judy Garland saying it.

What did I decide upon?  Perhaps that should be "What *will* I
decide upon", since I have not yet decided.  Stay tuned for tomorrow's
musing to find out.

[1] At least I plan to post my thousandth musing or rant tomorrow.  I suppose
something could happen that prevents me from doing so.  Or maybe my muse will
tell me to take a day off.  But the odds are good that I will post the musing
tomorrow.

[2] I expect that it will be a musing, not a rant.  

[3] Or "essay", as I called them in the early days.

[4] Perhaps that's all of my brain.

[5] Should that be "InterWeb" or perhaps "interweb".  The former
follows the computing world's tendency to use CamelCase.  The latter
is in keeping with the [horrendous AP decision to stop treating
Internet as a proper
noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization_of_Internet)
[6]?  CamelCase feels too much like a product [7].  And you can tell
how I feel about the decision to treat Internet as other than a proper
noun.  I'll stick with "Interweb".

[6] Why does the Wikipedia article begin with "This article relies
too much on references to primary sources"?  Shouldn't you primarily
rely on primary sources?  I'm so confused.

[7] I suppose the Interweb is a product of sorts, particularly with the
[planned sale of the .org TLD](https://slate.com/technology/2020/01/what-to-know-about-the-controversy-over-the-sale-of-org.html) [8].

[8] Top-level domain.

[9] Perhaps I should rethink my capitalization of "Interweb".

[10] With regards to [my somewhat recent musing on misnaming](misnaming-2019-12-08), I wonder how often that's misspelled as "Marian-Webster", or something similar.

[11] Perhaps me.

[12] Or misinterpret.

[14] Or "milliliter".

[15] Perhaps exactly seven tons, depending on how you interpret things.

[16] Or is that "seven tonnes"?  Or perhaps "approximately seven tonnes".

[17] The Interweb tells me that some people use "kiloyear".  I have not
met such people.  And why prioritize the Greek over the Latin?

[18] A.k.a. the First of April.

[19] If we assume the average musing takes an hour to write, one thousand
musings represents 1000 hours of work, or twenty-five forty-hour weeks.
That's about a half a year of full-time work.

[20] If you count the associated things I've written, such as the Makefile
and template, it's more than 1000.  Still, "filestone" seems appropriate.
I'm surprised that I did not mention it earlier.

[21] Here's what I wrote as the alt text.

> A drawing of what appears to be 1,000 stick figures, arranged to make the digits '1000'.  At the bottom, between the last two zeros, we see a stick figure with black hair saying 'WOOOO!' or 'W0000!' and a slightly taller stick figure with no hair saying 'Wow-Just 24 to go until a big round-number milestone!'.

It did not seem worth my time to attempt to describe each of the 1,000 stick
figures.  I wonder if someone has done so.  Oh, right. I could look on
[Explain XKCD](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1000:_1000_Comics).
The page says "about 2/3 are described [on this page](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1000:_1000_Comics/1000_characters)".  My count is that there are 354 without an explanation as of 26 January 2020, making it slightly less than 2/3 described.

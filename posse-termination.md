On the termination of Grinnell's partnership with the Posse Foundation
======================================================================

On Wednesday, 13 March 2016, President Kington sent a notice to the campus
that Grinnell would be terminating our partnership with the Posse foundation.
Grinnell will, fortunately, continue its obligation not only to our current
Posse students, but to the incoming Posse students in the class of 2016.
Like many on campus, I find myself frustrated not only by the decision,
but also the way in the decision was conveyed to the campus and the way
the decision was made, apparently without significant input from students
or faculty.  I am not alone in this frustration, and I've certainly talked
and listened to a wide variety of people who are equally frustrated.
This note gathers my current thoughts on the matter; those thoughts have
clearly been influenced by my conversations.  They are less coherent than
I would like;

Grinnell partnered with the Posse foundation for more than a decade.
We partnered with Posse for a wide variety of reasons.  Here are some
that come to mind: Our partnership with Posse brings to Grinnell a
diverse group of students who are equipped to succeed at Grinnell.
Our Posse partnership permits students who could not otherwise afford to
attend a top institution to receive a top-notch education.  Our Posse
students bring leadership to campus.  Our Posse students help other
students succeed.  Our partnership with Posse advertises Grinnell to
students who might not otherwise hear of Grinnell.  For all of these
reasons, Posse makes Grinnell a better place.

I am disappointed that the notification of the termination of our
partnership with Posse focused primarily on only one of these issues,
and primarily on Posse's effect on bringing domestic students of color
to campus.  In terms of diversity, I think that it is equally important
that Posse brings students who could not afford to come to Grinnell,
and students from geographic locations who would not normally attend a
rural school in the middle of Iowa.  And these are also important kinds
of diversity, particularly as we prepare our students to interact with
people who think in a wide variety of ways.

Beyond diversity, I am very disappointed that the notification did not
speak to the other important attributes that our Posse students bring
to campus.  Our Posse students are demonstrated leaders.  Our Posse
students form strong relationships, not just with each other, but also
with other students.  That has to have a significant effect on more
general student success at the College.  I'd like to know how we expect
to replace these great impacts of our Posse students.

In a response to the [piece in _Inside Higher
Ed_](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/18/grinnell-severs-ties-posse-foundation),
Kenneth Briggs critiqued Grinnell for "outsourcing" recruitment of students.
I'll note that Posse is much more than recruitment; it's also about 
preparation.  Posse students succeed not just because they have a 
cohort and a mentor, but because they have worked with the foundation
on leadership and study skills in advance.  Grinnell certainly does not
have experience in that area.  Just as we outsource architectural 
design and legal advice when we lack internal resources, it makes equal
sense to outsource recruitment and preparation when we lack the skills
and resources to do that ourselves.  I don't know of another equivalent
source, and we haven't been told about one.  (I will say that I've very
much appreciated the students I've met who are Questbridge scholars.  It's
also very clear that Questbridge and Posse target different groups of
students.)

Like many on campus, I am also frustrated that this decision does not
seem to have been made without wide consultation.  Certainly, the Posse
mentors and Posse scholars I've spoken with do not feel like they've
had input.  The Council members I've spoken with do not seem to have
had significant input.  It feels like something of this scope should have
been done consultatively.   There's no requirement that the President
and Board consult with the faculty; however, such consultation makes
Grinnell a stronger place.  I know that many faculty, myself included,
find that this situation represents a significant failure in shared
governance.

I also find myself puzzled by the timing.  The announcement was made
before our second "admitted students visit days", and I can't help but
think that hearing about the discontinuation of our partnership will
discourage some students from accepting the offer to attend Grinnell.
At the same time, I understand that making the announcement after May
1 would have also frustrated some admitted students, who would have
encountered what they might have considered a form of bait and switch.

I also find myself puzzled that there has not been a significant
opportunity for public discussion of these matters.  It was clear that
there would be concern, anger, and frustration.  It would seem that
people would want answers, and details on our future plans.  Why hasn't
there been a public forum?

I agree with Doug Cutchins that there's nothing we can do to restore
the partnership, and must instead look toward what we can do in the 
future.  I hope that we will explore the role of shared governance
in these kinds of decisions, and see better consultation.

As importantly, I hope that Grinnell will live up to our promises
to provide an even better substitute for our partnership with Posse.
While I respect my Dean, my President, and their staff, I find myself
worrying about what the future brings.  I'm even more worried because
a week has passed since the original announcement, and I've yet to
find someone who knows what the plans for a replacement are.  Perhaps I
shouldn't worry.  The last two major decisions that I've worried about --
the Young Innovator for Social Justice Prize and the Innovation Fund --
have proved useful additions to campus.

But I do worry.  I don't see how we achieve all the important aspects
of Posse without making some very significant changes and adding new
capabilities that we don't already have.  As I already noted, I see
great value in the Posse training program.  We have never offered such
a program.  Posse mentoring has been an important supplement to Grinnell's
close advising.  Given that it was a necessary supplement, I'm not sure
what will replace it.  Certainly, the PC-POP mentoring program, while
a great idea, has not been nearly as successful.  (And I say that as
a failed PC-POP mentor.)  While the Grinnell retreats I have attended
have been interesting, I don't think I've been to one as powerful as the
Posse Plus retreat.  We have big shoes to fill, as it were.  I hope we
do so quickly.

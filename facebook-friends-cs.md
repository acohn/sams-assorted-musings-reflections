New Facebook friends
====================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), social media, short*

Yesterday, three distinguished computer science educators friended me
on Facebook.  One is soon to receive a significant award, one is among
the most influential and energetic [1] young computer scientists I know,
as well as a leading force in diversifying the discipline, and one is
chair of a major conference.  They are all are professional friends [2].
Hence, in some sense, it's not surprising that they connected on Facebook;
But it's strange that it happened on the same day.

Did the Facebook algorithm suddenly decide to suggest me to people?
Did someone we know in common say "You should friend Sam on Facebook,
he posts a mediocre but occasionally amusing piece of writing each day"?
Are they all fake accounts through which someone is trying to infiltrate
the CS education community?  Is it one of those coincidences [5] that
naturally happen?  Probably the last.

Oh well, I'll treat it as another one of those mysteries of life.  Or
at least one of those mysteries of Facebook.

[1] I hear that they are now at Dan Garcia numbers in terms of annual
submissions to SIGCSE.

[2] No, that doesn't mean that their profession is "friend".  It means
that we know each other through our professions and regularly speak at
professional meetings.  [3]

[3] I feel I've made that "joke" way too many times already.  [4]

[4] Yes, the "air quotes" around "joke" are necessary.

[5] Or "coinky-dinks", as some pronounce it.

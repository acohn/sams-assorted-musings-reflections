Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Narren Brown
==========================================================

*Part of an ongoing series about people associated with Grinnell College.*

I'd like to introduce you to my friend and former colleague, Dr.
Narren Brown.  I think I've known Narren for his whole career at
Grinnell, and I appreciate the many things he has for the College.

I first met Narren when he was interviewing for his first position
at Grinnell, which I think was in whatever we called the Office of
Institutional Research and Analytic Support (OASIR) at the time.
He was a fresh Ph.D. (or near-Ph.D.) from Iowa State.  He struck
me as thoughtful and competent, interested in studying the kinds
of issues that are worth hiring.  We made a good decision in hiring
him.

I'll admit that I don't recall all the interactions I had with
Narren while he was in OASIR, or even if we had many interactions.
But Narren is a restless soul, and talented in many areas.  In
spring, 2013, Narren became Interim Director of the Office of
Intercultural Engagement and Leadership.  He did some fairly
interesting things in that position.  For example, he brought his
analytic skills to the study of issues pertaining to our domestic
students of color and first-gen students.  Rarely have we been as
well informed about those issues as when Narren was in the position.

Narren was also instrumental in setting up the Peer-Connections
Pre-Orientation Program (PCPOP), a program that builds a supportive
community among a diverse set of students.  Of course, Narren made
some strange decisions in that program, such as asking me to serve
as a mentor.  (I think I've been a fairly good mentor to the PCPOP
students who ended up in CS, but I wasn't assigned those students.
I was much less successful with my assigned students.)  Because
Narren built a strong program, we've made it a central part of our
post-Posse diversity efforts.

I really appreciate the casual interactions I had with Narren at
Grinnell.  We talked a lot about issues of diversity and the ways
in which Grinnell supports or fails to support our domestic students
of color.  I learned a whole lot from him.  Along the way, I learned 
that he was willing to sit in on faculty members' classes and observe
dynamics in those classes.  Because I worry about persistence of
students from underrepresented groups in our discipline, I asked him
to sit in on my section of the intro class.  I think students enjoyed
having him there.  However, because I'm such a spectacular teacher,
he didn't have a lot of suggestions for things to change, other than
indicating that I might have my class mentors do more of the typing
during class.

Somewhere along the way, Narren also became an informal part of the
CS department's search process.  He graciously offered to meet with
every candidate, to attend their classes, and to attend their talks.
I learned a lot hearing him talk about what he saw in those classes
and talks, particularly about how the candidates interacted with
students.  (I focus enough on content that I didn't catch many of
the things that he did.)  As importantly, having him talk to the
candidates about diversity issues helped reinforce to the candidates
the high value the department places on diversity.

At some point, Narren followed this interest in supporting teaching to
Grinnell's Center for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment (CTLA),
where he became assistant director.  In that role, Narren is
responsible for the latest phase of my career.  In one of our many
discussions about diversity in CS, Narren said something like: "Sam,
if you really want to make a difference in attracting a more diverse
group of people to computer science, you have to start earlier than
Grinnell.  By the way, did you know that there seem to be no summer
computing camps for middle-schoolers in Iowa?"  And so we wrote an
innovation fund proposal together to create camps focused on these
issues.

I appreciate that Narren pushed things in much different ways than
I would.  He helped us apply for and receive the governor's STEM
seal of approval.  He found interesting college students from beyond
Grinnell to help design and teach the camps.  He also did an awesome
job of mentoring the summer students who worked on the camps, not
only helping them think through issues of survey design, statistical
analysis, but also guiding them through the process of becoming
professionals and strong counselors.

Narren has had a long and interesting life path, from a childhood in
Oakland through work as a chef to an undergraduate degree at Luther
College and a graduate degree from Iowa State.  But I don't think
I have the right to say more than that.  I will say that his
wide-ranging background gave us the opportunity to talk about many
different things, from the joy of assessment (no, really) to knowing
Pete Brownell to assessing restaurants in Grinell to the frustrations
of CPAPs, and beyond.

This past month, Narren took the next step in his career and accepted
a position elsewhere with more responsibilities and, I think, a direct
report to the president.  We will miss him from Grinnell ... his energy
and enthusiasm for studying students, his thoughtful approaches to
diversity, his overall presence.  It will also be harder to run the
camps without him (but we'll keep trying).  Perhaps most importantly,
it's no longer clear who will keep the empress of the Forum basement
grounded.

Why did I write this long essay about Narren if he's no longer at Grinnell?
Well, when I planned the essay, I didn't know he was leaving, and he's
really a person that faculty and students would benefit from knowing.
Now that he's gone, I think I still owe him this tribute.  Plus, I expect
he'll be back to visit, and perhaps this essay will encourage you to meet
him when he returns to campus.

Textbooks and the bookstore
===========================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), intellectual property, long, rambly [1]*

A little while ago, I learned that the bookstore was selling international
editions of a textbook [2].  A bit before that, I noticed that the
only available copies of one required work of fiction for a course were
remainders [3].  Both choices make me uncomfortable, but I'm not sure
that they should.  This musing represents my attempt to consider the
issue in some more depth [4].

Ideally, intellectual property law, or at least copyright law, balances 
the interests of four or so parties.  The authors of a work should be able
to receive compensation for their work [5].  Consumers who purchase the work
should be able to use the work as they would anything else they own.
Publishers [6] who spend effort refining a work for sale and take
financial risks in bringing the work to market also deserve compensation.
And the nation benefits from a rich set of created and creative works [7].

One key issue in copyright is, of course, the right to make copies.
In societies without strong copyright, authors and their publishers
necessarily worry about "bootleg" copies of their work.  If I write a
novel that garners acclaim, it should not be possible for someone else to
print and sell copies of it.  If a publisher supported me in developing
that novel, I should not be able to suddenly switch to another publisher.

But we also have traditional consumers' rights.  If I buy a table from
someone, I am then free to do what I wish with that table.  I can resell
it.  I can carve designs on it and sell it as an artwork.  I can cut it
down into kindling and start a fire.  In the case of books, the first 
sale doctrine ensures that consumers have the right to resell the books
that they purchase.

What about the nation's broader interests?  Ensuring that authors receive
compensation helps encourage them to develop new works, which enhances the
standing and intellectual capital of a nation.  Ensuring that publishers
cannot be undercut by competitors helps encourage them to publish new
works, which benefits the financial state of the nation.  But there are
limits.  For example, the US fair use doctrine suggests that the nation
also benefits when excerpts of works are used in education, news, and
criticism.  Fair use is a delicate balancing act, but an important one.

Copyright law as a whole is also a balancing act.  I'm not sure if it's
ever been quite right.  But a number of factors are tilting the balance
in problematic ways.  Some tilting is intentional.  Some is a byproduct
of other changes.  Intentional tilting often happens through legislation;
for example, the span of copyright keeps increasing every time Disney is
at risk.  My reading is that the Music Modernization Act will do severe
damage to songwriters in an attempt to benefit record labels and services
like Spotify [8,9].

But the Internet has also had a huge impact, particularly in the textbook
market.  The biggest impact is on the role of used texts.  I think
we've always had textbook resellers.  But the rise of the Internet
has made it that much easier for them to connect with bookstores
and manage inventories.  And individuals now find it much easier to
resell their textbooks, not just to friends at the same institution,
but to almost anyone.  A seller's account on Amazon is easy to obtain.
And smart students shop for used texts in various places [10].

In reaction, textbook publishers appear to have significantly increased
their pricing.  While I appreciate the work that publishers put into their
work, I find a lot of that pricing immoral.  $100 for a disposable workbook
is insane.  But for textbooks that you know are going to be used again and
again and again and for which you only receive compensation once?  I can
understand some of the reasons that prices have gone up; if a textbook
gets resold four times on average rather than once [11], you have to make
much more on the initial sale.

Textbook publishers really do a lot of important work, from making sure
that textbooks are reviewed broadly to supporting the development of
ancillary materials to publicizing the work to faculty.  They and their
authors deserve compensation.

Still, the hundreds of dollars that textbooks command seems excessive.
And some of the development of ancillary resources that drive up costs
is of things that don't seem necessary.  As a professor, I encounter many
ancillaries that I have no plan to use, such as most electronic resources
[12].

As a professor, I've reacted to textbook prices in a number of ways.  For
some classes, I've written my own materials or adapted those of
colleagues in the department.  CSC 151 has always had locally written
materials through at least three versions of the course.  I also wrote
large amounts of material for CSC 152 (now 207).  For some
classes, I've looked for cheaper textbooks or open-source
textbooks.  In CSC 321 and CSC 322, I use [one text that is
available for free online](https://www.railstutorial.org/),
one that is [available for $10 in electronic
format](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Software-Service-Approach-Computing-ebook/dp/B00CCEHNUM/)
[14], and [one that is part of the ACM Safari
Collection](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/practical-object-oriented-design/9780134445588/),
and so available as part of the students' $19 ACM membership [15].
And for some, I've used professional texts, ones that I expect to see
on their bookshelves in a decade.  [Kernighan and
Ritchie](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/)
fits in that category, as does the original [_Design
Patterns_](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/),
as does
[CLRS](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/)
[16].  But there have also been times that I've chosen a commercial
textbook because I couldn't find anything as good.  In the end, I want
the text that best serves my students.

Where were we?  Oh, yeah.  This musing was supposed to be about the
bookstore selling international editions and remainders.  I wanted to
get some background in place to help myself consider the various issues
at play.

International editions are an interesting case.  Publishers and
authors accept less for international editions because they serve
the greater good [17].   The assumption is that they are produced for
a non-US market and that the textbook development is, in effect,
subsidized by domestic sales. Since [a legal case a few years
back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtsaeng_v._John_Wiley_%26_Sons,_Inc.)
determined that these textbooks are covered under first-sale doctrine,
it is legal to buy and sell them in the US, even though they generally
say something like "not produced for sale in the US".

Although that case clarified the legality of domestic sales of
international editions, my impression was that the sales generally
happened online and through non-institutional channels.  Having a
bookstore sell international editions somehow feels different.  I know
that I would not feel comfortable asking a publisher for a desk copy
or an examination copy of a textbook if my institution were only selling
international copies of that textbook.

I don't feel the same way about texts for which we sell only used copies.
That is, I'd certainly feel comfortable asking for a desk copy if we
only sold used copies.  After all, publishers do seem to  set prices
under the assumption that texts get resold.  I also don't feel the same
way about texts that have a legal free online version.  In that case,
the online version is part of the publishing model; for whatever reason,
they feel that enough physical copies [18] are sold that the free online
version is appropriate.  And I know that even when the text is available
for free online, some students buy copies.

But the international copies?  I don't think that's part of the
publisher's calculus.  I would venture to guess that publishers assume
that domestic bookstores don't regularly stock international editions.
I certainly wouldn't want that publisher to know that we were selling
international copies.

What about the other side?  There are some fairly significant benefits
to students being able to pick up an affordable printed copy on campus.
Students are more likely to be able to afford $25 for the international
edition than the $176 list price for a hardcover [19].  It's not much
different than the $35 the publisher charges for a legal "digital
subscription" copy, but I don't really like the "digital subscription"
model, which undermines first sale and provide an assumption that
students won't have long-term benefit from the text.  I also prefer
that students work from printed texts if they can; I think the evidence
is that students read printed texts better [20].  And I'd rather that
students have direct access to the text rather than relying on a friend
or the library.  So there are a lot of benefits to a $25 copy.  And I
suppose that students could buy it online for $25 in any case [21];
we're just making things easier for them.

While I'm pondering those issues, let's turn to the issue of the
remainders.  As far as I know, authors get nothing for remainders.
From my perspective, that makes them different than used copies,
particularly for class use.  For used copies, the author has received
some compensation and, if some authors I know are to be believed, accept
that used resale is part of the bargain.  I expect that some authors
even accept that there will be remainders of their books.  But when the
only copies available for a class are remainders?  That seems wrong.
The class is relying on the authors' creative work and, in the case of
a book-length work of fiction, it's an amount that's clearly beyond the
rubrics of fair use.  The author deserves compensation.

Even though I consider it wrong to only stock remainders, I don't
blame the bookstore [22].  They order copies of books from suppliers.
If the supplier says "We have twenty used copies" and sends along
twenty remaindered copies, the bookstore doesn't really have an option.
In this case, I think the problem is more the publisher's willingness to
remainder large numbers of the book and the used textbook markets' ability
to take advantage of that.  And popular works are not like textbooks;
the initial price and the compensation to the author are not nearly
as high.  I don't know what you do about that.  The whole process of
using used works of fiction in class is problematic [23].

Part of me wants to ask the professor to gather money from the class
and send it to the author.  But how would an author feel about that?
"Our bookstore stocked remainders of your work.  We think you deserve
compensation.  Each student chipped in $2.  We're sending you $40."

Hmmm ... I seem to have ve gone about as far as I can on this topic.
What have I figured out?  It strikes me that the academic book market
is broken.  While things seem like they are getting better for students
in some ways, it looks like it's getting worse for students in other ways
(e.g., those who end up having to purchase a new text spend much more).
And, as far as I can tell, the system makes things worse for authors,
particularly for authors of trade books.

I don't have a good solution.  Now that I think about it, I may even be
part of the problem.  For certain classes, I just buy enough used copies
of the text and loan them to my students each semester.  I've done that
for TEC 154 and I've done that for Tutorial.  I also buy used copies
of the book for Intro Studio and donate them to the art department so
that they can loan them to students.  I'm keeping the used texts out of
the market, but I'm also setting up a system in which the authors and
publishers don't get compensated.  For the textbooks I use, I'm not
concerned; the pricing model deals with that.  But for the trade books
that start out reasonably priced, such as Joe Williams' [_Style: Toward
Clarity and Grace_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0226899144/), I'm a bit
more concerned that I'm affecting compensation, even in a relatively
minor way.  Of course, in the particular case of _Style_, that book is now
out of print.  In addition, I bought some portion of the copies new, so
Williams got some compensation [24].  I'll have to consider whether I want
to try the "Gather money from students and send a check to the author"
model the next time I pass out used copies of trade books in class [25].

Maybe that's my personal solution to both problems [26].  If students
and faculty think about the value the books bring to their learning
and contribute a few bucks for each used book they get, authors get
better compensated.  That model doesn't help with publishers.  However,
I'm pretty sure that most publishers have designed a model that ensures
they make sufficient profit.  It also doesn't help with high textbook
prices; that's a more complex issue that I deal with in multiple other
ways (including handing out used copies in class).  And, as I said, my
primary focus in this musing was to consider the implications of these
two particular cases.

What are those implications?  It's good that students get affordable
copies of books.  It's bad that authors don't get sufficiently compensated.
My solution is ad hoc.  It doesn't solve the broader problem of author
compensation.  It certainly doesn't solve the broader problem of textbook
affordability.  Leaving the problem to the market doesn't really seem to 
make sense; we increasingly see the market finding ways to make a profit
with sufficient benefit to neither producer nor consumer.  

I've come back to this musing multiple times [27].  I'm still not
completely sure what my own perspective is or should be.  Selling only
remainders or only international editions seems wrong.  But I don't
think I should critique my colleagues or my bookstore for the decision;
I can see arguments about how these practices are good for our students
and accept that it's reasonable to prioritize those students.  And, as
I said, some of my own practices that are designed to support students
also negatively impact authors.

I wish I could use this topic as an excuse to rant.  But it's not a simple
issue.  And, if I accept complexity, I find it difficult to rant.  Instead,
I'll hope that some of my readers will react in ways that help me think
more deeply about the issue.  And I'll continue to reflect on it.  We shall
see if my opinions evolve [28].

Postscript: I miss Richard Fyffe.  He would have had some interesting
and informed comments on these topics.

[1] Do I have any long musings that aren't rambly?  I hope so!

[2] An international edition of a textbook is an edition designed for
students in another country, typically one not as wealthy as the US.
International editions generally have the same content but usually have
lesser production values and may have different questions.

[3] A remaindered copy is a copy that the publisher decides can no longer
be sold as new.  It could be a return from a bookstore.  It could be that
they printed many more copies than they sold and no longer want them
in their warehouses.  As far as I know, authors receive no royalties
from remainders.  You can often identify a remainder by a big black
marked stripe along the side of the text.

[4] I must admit that my muse leads me in some fairly strange directions.

[5] Assuming, of course, that they wish to receive compensation.

[6] Or equivalent.

[7] I accept that I have a somewhat American perspective on IP law.  The
parts of the constitution that focus on intellectual property talk about
the benefits to the nation.

[8] If you want to hear more from the songwriters' side, I'd suggest
checking out [The Trichordist](https://thetrichordist.com/).  At some
point, I'll write more about IP and music, including my reaction to the
awesomely cheap multi-disc jazz sets available from the UK, which, I
expect, provide absolutely no compensation to anyone involved in creating
the music.

[9] It makes me sad that [the EFF supports the Music Modernization
Act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/music-modernization-act-good-solution-songwriters-dont-combine-it-bad-copyright), which really does seem to
be more about supporting streaming services than supporting songwriters.

[10] [Bookfinder](https://www.bookfinder.com) is my preferred used book
search tool.

[11] Those numbers are fictitious.

[12] Electronic resources are often especially expensive to develop.

[14] I recall hearing one of the authors say that they hoped to open
source the whole textbook once they had recouped their costs.  (I will
admit that not everything I recall is true.)

[15] That assumes that students decide to join ACM.  It also assumes that
ACM continues to provide student members with access to Safari.

[16] Sorry for using names that only insiders will understand.  But the
names aren't all that important.

[17] Okay, I'll admit that I don't really know why publishers and authors
develop lower-priced international editions.  "The greater good" seems
to make sense.

[18] Or licenses for ancillaries.

[19] Hmmm ... that's more than $160 for a textbook that was first
published in 2005.  

[20] I'm too lazy to look for that evidence right now.

[21] In fact, if you search the title and author of this text on Amazon,
the first result is the international edition.

[22] Or at least I don't think I blame the bookstore.

[23] Used works of fiction can be problematic in many ways.  In one of
my children's classes, the work was out of print.  We ended up paying
$50 for a used copy of a book whose cover price was under $20.

[24] Or his family got some compensation.

[25] I don't know when that will be.  I hope Tutorial is my next non-CS
course.  But I won't be teaching Tutorial next year (fellowship) or the
next year (sabbatical).  Three years in the future is far enough that
it's hard to know what I'll be doing.

[26] In case you've forgotten, "both problems" refers to (a) international
editions of textbooks and (b) remaindered copies of trade books.

[27] Four?  Five?  Three?  Six?  I'm not sure.

[28] If they do, I'll muse about the topic again.

Words I hate: Relatable
=======================

There are some words I have an unhealthy aversion to.  One of them is
"relatable".  I cringe, every time I hear it.  "Justin Beaver is so
relatable."  "One of the things that makes Donald Trump such a great
president is that he is relatable."  "She's so relatable."  "Hilary
didn't win because people didn't find her relatable."

Its meaning, in common parlance, is unambiguous: "They are
relatable" means "They are someone to whom I can relate" [1].  I don't
recall it being in common use until recently, although the [Google n-gram
viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=relatable&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1800&year_end=2015&corpus=15&smoothing=7&share=&direct_url=t4%3B%2Crelatable%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Brelatable%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BrelaTABLE%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BRelatable%3B%2Cc0)
seems to suggest that it peaked in the late 1970's.

I'm generally in favor of words that clarify and simplify.  So why do
I hate "relatable", other than the contexts in which I usually hear it [2]?

Perhaps it's that it's a nominalization.  I spent enough time working with
the Joe Williams approach to writing [3] that I like to hear actors and 
actions.  *Who* relates to the person so described?  Is it the speaker?
Is it the speaker suggesting a broader sense of relatability?  "Relatable"
obscures.

And is "relate" really the appropriate word?  I also don't like hearing
"I relate to [insert random pop star]".  I guess it's appropriate; as
it means to be connected.  But "I feel connected to [insert random pop
star'" feels more powerful to me, as does "I think many people would
feel a connection to [insert random pop star]".

Those serve as a few core complaints: "Relatable" is a nominalization and
therefore causes the speaker/writer to eschew a clear actor and action.
"Relate" seems like a weaker word than "connect" or other related words.
So yes, I do have reasons to dislike the word.

Or maybe it's just that I'm not relatable.

My spell checker also doesn't think "relatable" is a word, but it has a
fairly limited vocabulary.  It also doesn't like "nominalization", perhaps
because it doesn't like seeing me nominalize that word..

[1] Maybe it doesn't.  Maybe it means "They are someone to whom others
can relate."

[2] I would venture to guess that I hear it most frequently used in
relation to pop stars, but perhaps I'm mistaken.  I have heard the
Hilary quote, which is perhaps another reason.

[3] Exemplified by Chicago's "Little Red Schoolhouse" and a variety of
books whose title normally begins _Style_.

Doug Cutchins' Essay
====================

*Warning!  This essay includes some statements about gender roles
and their effects on student decisions and performance.  I know that
each individually is different.  I also know that we see generalities
when we look at large groups, rather than individuals.  I have done my
best to represent what I've read in the literature and heard from
reputable sources.*

*Warning!  This essay, like the essay I reflect upon, generally treats
gender as a binary, rather than a spectrum.  Since the original essay
used a binary, I have responded using a similar binary.*

Earlier today, Doug Cutchins '93 posted a long essay entitled
[Grinnell College, the midwest's premier liberal arts college...for
women](http://www.dougcutchins.com/single-post/2016/10/29/Grinnell-College-the-midwests-premier-liberal-arts-collegefor-women).
In it, Cutchins argues that (a) there are significant "discrepancies in
achievements between its male and female students" [1] and that therefore
(b) "Grinnell should become a women's college."  Now, I'm not sure
how serious Doug is in the essay.  It could be that he's just trying
to bring up some important issues, and to get us to think outside the
box.  It could be he wants to think more about how and why we under-value
women.  It could be that he's looking forward to sending his awesome children
to Grinnell, and wants to change the College before they arrive.  

But he's being pretty inflammatory.  My sons who attend Grinnell are
angry.  And, as both a parent of Grinnell males and a faculty member
at Grinnell, I think I owe my sons and the broader community a response
from my perspective.  And, as is the norm, I'm using the essay as a
way to think through some issues.  I'll admit that I thought I'd be
defending Cutchins to my sons.  However, as I write the essay, I find
I'm defending males to Cutchins.

Cutchins opens with a challenge.

> It's hard to encapsulate Grinnell in a short, pithy way, or define
what the world would be missing if Grinnell disappeared.  What is Grinnell
doing that Oberlin, Macalester, or Carleton are not?

I think I can answer that.

> Grinnell is one of the few places in the country where talented domestic
students can get a top-notch liberal arts education in a diverse community
of students irrespective of their ability to pay for such an education.
Grinnell also builds strong citizens by giving students significant
control over their college experience, control exemplified by both the
individually mentored curriculum and principles of self governance.

What do I mean by that?  For the first issue, as far as I know, none of
those three peers come close to our support for low-SES [2] students.
And, as I've heard from visiting college counselors, Grinnell really is
more diverse than its peers.

For the second, the difference in student roles is exemplified by a
simple comparison: Both Mac and Grinnell have startup weekends.  At Mac,
administrators designed and created the weekend.  At Grinnell, students
designed and created the weekend, and offices on campus provided them
with necessary support.  That's a huge difference.  When I've talked
to administrators who've been at both institutions, they tell me that
Grinnell students have more of a voice (and take advantage of that voice)
than students at our peers.

---

But that's not the main thrust of Doug's essay.  As I noted, he's
concerned about many issues of the male campus population.  Let's
look at some of those issues.

> Female students at Grinnell, overall, perform better academically
and have higher GPAs.  They study abroad more often.  They do much more
service work.  Those are all measurable factors, but anecdotal examples
also abound: the year that the Grinnell Corps was comprised of 10 women.
The Watson information meeting I held when 22 students showed up, all of
whom were women.  The year when the community service center had so many
women volunteers that service group leaders felt compelled to gather in
order to talk about how to recruit more men.

What does it mean to "perform better academically" other than GPAs?
I'm not sure.  But I would not want to compare students blindly on GPAs.
For example, there's historical evidence that men are more likely to major
in the sciences and that the sciences tend to award lower grades than
fields outside the sciences [3].  Could differences in GPAs correlate
to differences in choices of major?  I believe that when men and women
earn a B in a class in their chosen discipline, men are more likely to
push ahead and women are more likely to take that as a sign that they
should choose a different major [4].  So perhaps women intentionally
or unintentionally choose a path that leads to a higher GPA.  I'll also
admit that I'm not sure that I would want to judge students on their GPAs;
when I think about my students, I think about how they work with others,
how much they care about what they do, and how willing they are to take
risks, among other things.

Differences in major may also lead to differences in whether or not
students study abroad.  Many science majors worry about their ability
to study abroad when dealing with majors that usually follow a fairly
strict sequence of courses.  I know that has been an issue for CS majors
in the past [5].  I believe that most sciences have found more programs
in which students can take courses that allow them to progress in the
major, so I wonder if we'd see the same discrepancy.  In any case, this
is an instance in which we should "drill down" into the data a bit more,
and not just look broadly at men vs. women.  In my department, it strikes
me that men and women are studying abroad at about the same rates.

There may also be huge financial issues in choosing to study abroad.
I have no idea how (or whether) there is a difference in ability to pay
between our women students and our men students.  However, if there is, it
could explain some of the differences in study abroad.  I know of at least
three seniors whose ability to study abroad was impacted by finances.
One could not afford to go.  One could not afford to go for a semester,
and did a short program.  One could only go through Grinnell in London.

Returning to academic performance, I'll note that there seems to be
a fairly even gender divide in both [the President's Medalists](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/confops/commencement/presidents-medal)
and [the Archibald Prize](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/confops/commencement/archibald), our top two academic honors [6].

I don't know as much about the service issue.  It may well be that
men do service at a much lower rate.  However, it strikes me that the
Grinnellian approach to a finding that men do less service is (a) to
try to find the underlying causes and (b) develop programs to encourage
more men to do service.  Just as we have a Grinnell Science Project to
encourage Grinnellians from groups underrepresented in the sciences to
persist, so might we have a well-designed Grinnell Service Program to
encourage Grinnellians who might not otherwise serve to serve.

Do I know that the evidence suggests that most elite colleges are more
selective in the women they accept than the men they accept?  Yes,
I've heard that regularly, and I believe that it's true in some ways.
What I understand is that the range of acceptable scores on standardized
tests goes a bit lower for men than it does for women.  I don't know
if that holds at Grinnell.  But, even if it does, I do think that we
benefit from a mixture of students.  If, as I'd argue, we should look at
other issues than GPA or scores when "shaping" a class to ensure that we
include multiple perspectives, then I'd accept that some of the shaping
might be based on providing an appropriate gender balance.

Do I agree with the analysis that Doug linked from
[_The Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/30/achieving-perfect-gender-balance-on-campus-isnt-that-important-ending-private-colleges-affirmative-action-for-men-is)?  Let's see what that says.

> At Vassar College, the 34 percent acceptance rate for men was almost
twice as high as the 19 percent rate for women. At Columbia University,
the acceptance rate was 8 percent for men versus 6 percent for women. At
Vanderbilt University, it was 15 percent versus 11 percent. Pomona
College: 15 percent versus 10 percent. Williams College: 21 percent
versus 18 percent. This bias in private-college admissions is blatant
enough that it can’t be long before “gender-blind admissions”
becomes the new campus rallying cry.

This is another one of those cases in which one needs to dig more
deeply in to the data to see what's happening.  Could it be that
the women are perhaps less competitive?  (Probably not, but it's
worth asking.)  Could it be that women have better yields at these
institutions?  (That is, could it be that most women apply to a few
schools, and go to one of these schools when accepted, whereas men
apply to many schools, and are less likely to accept an acceptance?)
Is it that more women apply than men, but the schools want something
like a gender balance?  Perhaps.

But you know what?  The author links to the data.  So let's 
[look at Grinnell's data](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=Grinnell&s=all&id=153384).  Grinnell had 6,414 total applicants, 3,009 of whom seemed
to self identify as male, and 3,405 who seemed to self-identify as
female [7].  We admitted 24% of males and 25% of females.  We yielded
28% of admitted males and 28% of admitted females.

Sorry Doug; it doens't look like Grinnell has a different acceptance
rate for the two groups.  (That doesn't mean that we have different
criteria for the two groups; I still think there's a possibility that
we do things to ensure balance.  However, according to the article
you linked, there's not the main issue; acceptance rates are.)

---

Doug reports that "A former Dean of Students at Grinnell once told me
that he estimated that a whopping 80% of the academic and conduct offense
cases on campus have men at the center of them."  I am fortunate enough
not to have served on CAS, the College Hearing Board, or Joint Board,
so I cannot speak to those statistics.  They may be true.  But even if
they are true, I think it's a case in which we have to dig deeper into
the statistics, or things behind the statistics.  Could it be, for example,
that faculty are more likely to report a man than a woman for academic
dishonesty?  (I will say that I've seen some male high school teachers
be much more combative with male students than female students; it's
not a stretch to see a faculty member thinking that a male's apparent
misconduct is a challenge to authority, and therefore worth reporting,
while a woman's is an innocent mistake [8].)  Could it be an extension
of apparent faculty biases against male athletes from the "big 3" [9]?

---

My sons report that they felt that Doug attacked athletics in the article.
I don't see it.  But, just in case Doug did mean to criticize athletics,
let's consider them anyway.  As someone who did not pursue athletics
in college (well, I did do intramural archery and some Ultimate),
but who has sons who are multi-sport athletes, I've seen some great
benefits to varsity athletics.  In particular, I appreciate the ways
in which they develop "soft skills": How to work as part of a team, how
to graciously accept failure, how to subtly challenge authority, how to
balance different things, how to lead (at least in some cases), and more.

Those are important skills.  At today's Volleyball game, they reported
on the seniors' post-graduate plans.  One is going to med school.  One
is going to grad school (in English, I think).  One is spending a few 
years working and then plans to go on to grad school (in Econ, I think).
One plans to be a politician.  

That's not atypical.  Here's a quotation from [an article on the 100th
anniversary of the first Grinnell-Iowa game](http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-03/sports/sp-2185_1_grinnell-football).

> Take the 1988 football team, which was 2-6. One senior was accepted to
medical school, another enrolled in the Ph.D. program at Utah State and a
third is studying chemistry at Northwestern.  "To me, that's as gratifying
to see as someone being a first-or second-round draft pick," said football
coach Greg Wallace. "They're going to be leaders in their profession."

That is to say, I don't think Grinnell varsity athletes are substantively
different in terms of talent and interests than other Grinnell students.

I suppose I'll return to this issue in another essay.

---

Let's move on to Doug's final point, that Grinnell should consider becoming
a women's college.  Since I don't accept many of Doug's other analyses,
I'm not sure that I can easily accept this conclusion.  Even if I did
accept Doug's analyses, I'd probably challenge this conclusion.  Why?
Because it would completely transform the students at Grinnell.  It's
not just that we wouldn't have men.  It's that we wouldn't have most of
the current women students, either.  After all, they chose to come to
a co-educational school.

That said, I very much appreciate Doug's challenge to think outside the
box.  And I've certainly heard many other similar challenges.  I recall
Mark Montgomery noting that with our endowment, we could probably enroll
students only from Eastern Europe (and maybe only in one country from
Eastern Europe) and significantly increase the academic talent and potential
of our students.  Mark wasn't proposing that as a serious approach (or at
least I don't think he was).  But I think he was challenging us to think
about what we really value.

In the end, I think I've already said what I most value about Grinnell:
We are accessible to domestic students of a wide variety of backgrounds
(and somewhat accessible to international students of a wide variety
of backgrounds).  We bring together people with different backgrounds,
experiences, and perspectives [11] and empower them to individually and
collaborative build their college experiences.  It makes as much sense
to me to ensure that that diversity includes gender diversity as it
does to ensure that it includes racial diversity.

I do like Mark Schneider's suggestion that we go tuition free.  (Given that
we are already giving average financial aid of about $45K/year, that's not
a big stretch.)  Now *that* would be a courageous transformation.  It
also seems to be a good subject for a future essay.  I wonder if I can
find Mark's original proposal?

---

Now that I've responded defensively to Doug's essay, what do I discover
that I really think?  I'm bothered that I feel so defensive.  Doug is
clearly good at pushing my buttons (and, clearly, others' buttons).

I'm surprised that Doug seems so extreme in how he presents things.
And that's not the Doug I know.  So, what's up?

One possibility: Someone hacked Doug's account.  I don't think that's
likely.

Another possibility: Doug is completely serious.  Maybe some things
happened that really set him off.  It sounds like some of these
issues have been on his mind for years, and so perhaps he reached a
tipping point.  Maybe that tipping point was the treatment of a student
or students he knows.  Maybe it's him thinking about his children.
I'm not sure.

A third possibility: Doug is confused at what day of the year it is,
and this is an April Fool's essay.  Certainly, that's implied by some
statements like "Especially when men are already lifted up and given
unfair advantages by our patriarchal society, what on earth could be a
reasonable excuse for why male Grinnellians are performing so poorly?"
Or perhaps he's become a Trump supporter and he's satirizing feminists.

A fourth possibility: Doug is offended by Raynard's original question,
and is suggesting that if we have to make Grinnell into something
totally unique, we'll be going off track.

A final possibility: By being this extreme, Doug is challenging us to
think about our values more deeply.  Why would we want to keep men,
even if we see that men are less successful than women?  As we make
arguments for that, we might also be making arguments for keeping
other groups who are sometimes less "successful" than other groups.
I know that he's challenged me to think more about how I view the
kinds of statistics we regularly use [12].  And, as I noted above,
I do appreciate the challenge to think outside the box about Grinnell.

Will Doug tell us more about what he was thinking?  I hope so.  

---

Was this a useful essay for me to write?  I'm not sure.  I feel strange
about being so defensive.  I don't feel like I've responded properly to
what I hope are Doug's challenges to think outside the box.  On the other
hand, I have identified what I most value about Grinnell (three things:
diversity, need-blind admissions plus meeting full demonstrated need,
the hybrid of open curriculum and self gov).  Still, I don't feel good.
I prefer either the joy of a really positive essay or the righteous
anger that comes from a rant.  This essay gives me neither.  Oh well.
In the mean time, he's inspired me to write a few more essays.

---

Followup: Doug wrote [a followup essay](http://www.dougcutchins.com/single-post/2016/10/30/Continuing-the-conversation) in which he says 

> There have been several calls, both public and private, for me to explain myself and the essay further, specifically to state whether I intended it to be taken at face value or as satire. 

> Given the range of reactions, for me to continue to center my opinion by "explaining what I meant" would be to stifle the re-emergence of an important and wider conversation about access and support that I urge the Grinnell community to continue.

Of course, that answer explains very well what he intended, as does the
end of the followup.  

> I would hope that this essay ultimately awakens and continues several important conversations in the Grinnell community:

> How does Grinnell define its values?  How are those values revealed in the student body?

> How do we decide who gets to join this community and who is excluded?  What are the values that go into those decisions?  What measures do we use to make such decisions, and do those measures reflect our values?  

> What is the college’s responsibility for measuring success among students, and how should it do so?  How does Grinnell know if it is accomplishing what it has set out to do and is fulfilling its values?

> What are the appropriate institutional support mechanisms that Grinnell needs to have in place to help students be successful?  How much do those differ from student to student?  To what extent is Grinnell meeting its obligations to its students?  What is the appropriate reaction if Grinnell discovers it is not adequately supporting some students?

Thanks Doug [13]!

[1] Yes, Cutchins does accept that there is not just a gender binary.

[2] Socio-economic status, for those who don't know that TLA.

[3] I don't think I understand all of the reasons for the grading
differences. One claim I've heard is that it can be easier to quantify 
differences in performance in the sciences.

[4] That's a sign of a big problem.  If students are equally successful,
they should stay at equal rates.  But women treat the "B"s as a sign that
they don't belong.

[5] Students have certainly dealt with it.  As a recent visitor to
Learning from Alumni noted, they started with CSC 151 in fall of their
second year, went abroad to a place with no CS, and still completed a
CS major (with honors).  The creation of the AIT program in Budapest
has made it much easier for our CS majors to study CS while studying
abroad. 

[6] At least one of the recent winners lived in gender-neutral housing,
so this may be an instance in which using the gender binary is particularly
inappropriate.  

[7] The data say "male" and "female".  I assume they ask applicants to
self identify on the gender binary.

[8] Yeah, I'll admit that this is a stretch.  But I really do think that
this is a case in which implicit bias may play a role.

[9] The big three are football, basketball, and baseball.  I have no idea
what the standardized test score of grade distributions are for men (or
women) from these teams are.  But there is this underlying view, similar
to the view in Doug's essay about men vs. women, that we drop standards
for athletes from those groups.  I'll even admit to harboring that view
in my early years at Grinnell [10].  And, it's clear that students worry
about this bias; many athletes at Grinnell worry about revealing their
status to their faculty.

[10] I work very hard to fight that bias.  I think I mostly succeed.
I hear from sources that most athletes consider me very supportive, and
I very much support our athletics program.

[11] Okay, I'll admit that it's hard to be a conservative student on
campus.

[12] Of course, that's not really anything new.  I always try to dig
more deeply into the statistics I read.

[13] And I still hope you'll post the original followup you intended.

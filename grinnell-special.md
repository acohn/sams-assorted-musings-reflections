What Makes a Grinnell Education Special?
========================================

*I've just finished a year of helping my middle son choose a college.
Along the way, I thought about different kinds of schools, and also
about what makes a Grinnell education special.  This essay reflects
my attempt to record what I think sets us apart.  My Dean, Mike 
Latham, does a better job than I at highlighting the strengths of a
Grinnell education, but I still find it worthwhile to myself to record
my thoughts.*

There are a wide variety of kinds of institutions in this country.
Small, private, liberal-arts colleges.  Large public and private
research institutions.  Community colleges.  Mid-sized public and private
institutions.  And many many more.  Grinnell is a highly-ranked, small,
private, liberal-arts college, and shares many characteristics with
its peers.  I'll begin with those.

Grinnell, like its peers.
Grinnell, like its peers, has a faculty who are committed to both teaching
and scholarshp.  That is, the faculty spend a lot of time thinking about

how best to teach

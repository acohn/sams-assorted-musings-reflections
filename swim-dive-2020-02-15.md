Today, Middle completed his last dive as a D3 athlete at Grinnell.
It was a ????, which means "".  Learning how to interpret dive
abbreviations was one of the thrills of having a son decide to dive
[1].  I'm pretty sure that that makes today the last time I sit in
the sauna that is the Osgood Natatorium [2], watching one of my
offspring compete.

I appreciate how divers and swimmers can be simultaneously competitive
and cooperative.  Divers, in particular, impress me with their
mutual support.  I like that they do a cheer together at the start
of their portion ofo the meet.  I like that they all seem to cheer
each other after a dive.  I like that ithis morning I watched a
coach and a diver encourage someone from another school during
practice.  Supportive.

It's been a fun run [3].  It's also been a long run.  The Nat, as
people call it, also serves as the practice and competition space
for the Grinnell and BGM [4] High School Swim Team [6].  So I've
been watching my kids compete here since 2009 or so.  All three
sons swam in high school.  One swam and competed in water polo in
college.  One dove [7]. Its a lot of years of competitions.

Now it's over.  I'll still come back, from time to time.  I've come
to love watching diving, even if it's not one of my students [8].
And I'll always want to support my student swimmers [9], even if I
won't be here quite as often.

At least there's alumni weekend.

[1] I suppose I could have learned them when my advisees dove, but
that didn't happen.

[2] Steaming hot in the stands, cold on the deck.  Definitely a bad
design.  As far as I can tell, they are trying to blow heat from
above.  Given that heat rises, the strategy makes no sense.

[3] A fun _swim_?

[4] Brooklyn, Guernsey, Malcom [5]

[5] Dear spell checker: The town's name has only one "l".

[6] Yes, the two schools share a team.  BGM doesn't have enough
people (or a pool) for a team.  We generally have only one or
two BGM swimmers on the team.  I'm impressed that they make the
drive for the 6am practices.

[7] And swam a bit.

[8] I still do prefer watching Grinnell students swim.

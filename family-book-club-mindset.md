Family book club: _Mindset_
===========================

*Topics/tags: [Those wacky Rebelskys](index-rebelskys)*

A few months ago, I started reading Carol Dweck's _Mindset_ [1].
Dweck's distinction between fixed mindset and growth mindset struck
a chord.  Certainly, I exhibited some tendencies toward a fixed mindset
when I was in college.  For example, I took my score on my first college
math exam as evidence that I would never be a great mathematician [2].
But a lot of my life has been about growth.  I've challenged myself with
film classes, with studio art, with teaching courses I've never taken,
and more.  As Dweck notes, most of us are somewhere on a spectrum between
pure fixed mindset and pure growth mindset.

In any case, as I read the first few chapters of Dweck, I started worrying
about whether Michelle and I had been raising our children with a fixed
mindset.  Certainly, we celebrated many of their achievements, from their
seventh-grade ACT scores [3] to their reading lexiles, as evidence of
their intelligence.  And that's exactly what Dweck cautions against.

So I suggested that everyone in the family read the book.  Of course,
it's my family, so someone [4] suggested that we form a "Rebelsky Family
Reading Group".  The idea was that we all read the book and then discuss
it together.  I had only asked that people read it, or at least the
first chapter.  But a family bonding activity sounded good.

Today, we had the book club discussion.  It started at 5:00 about p.m.
It ended at about 7:30 p.m.  Like any Rebelsky family discussion, it
diverged from the main topic at many times and included some of the
traditional Rebelsky family memes [5].  I found it interesting to see
how each of us read and reacted to the book.  It appears we all agreed
with the basic theme that a growth mindset is preferable, but we had very
different reactions to the rest of the book: the quality of the studies,
the use of repeated anecdotes, the implications, and so on and so forth.
I'm not going to relay the details because, well, I don't consider it
appropriate to share my family's opinions broadly and, given both my
normal (lack of) hearing and the addition of a cold, I'm not sure that
I'd get everything right.

I will say that I was happy to hear that we've generally done a good
job of helping our children rely more on internal validation rather than
external validation and to enjoy challenges [6].  I guess I shouldn't be
surprised, all three sons regularly make me proud with how they approach
the world.

I also appreciated our use of technology.  We all read the book on Kindle
and were able to share notes, bookmarks, and highlights as we went. That
meant that we had a good way to structure our discussion.  That is, we
went through the book from front to back, stopping mostly at the parts that
someone had selected.  As I said, it was a Rebelsky family discussion, so
we also detoured to other topics and other parts of the book.  But the
technology gave us a helpful framework.

In the end, the best part was having a long discussion with my family.
Dinner discussions have always been part of our modus operandi.  However,
we've had fewer opportunities for them of late.  

I look forward to our next four Rebelsky Family Book Club meetings, one
on Emma Bull's _War for the Oaks_, one on "some personal finance book",
one on a book on stoicism, and one yet to be determined [7].  I know
they'll be great.  And while you can't join in, perhaps you'll be able
to experience them vicariously through musings about the meetings and
the books.

[1] Eventually, I'll even muse about it.

[2] I scored an 83.  That sounds oka, until you realize that it was out
of 150 rather than 100.  Then it sounds bad.  But I had placed out of
the 100-level math classes and was in a class with mostly second-year
students.  And, well, it was the third highest grade in the class.
So perhaps it wasn't so bad.  However, the two higher grades were also
first-year students and the top grade was 143.  In any case, I clearly
had a fixed mindset because I took it as evidence that although I could
be a decent mathematician, I would never be a great one. That view stuck
with me throughout the rest of my undergraduate career.  Of course,
the 0 on the Putnam didn't help much either, even though it put me in
the 50th percentile of people taking the Putnam.

[3] Ah, the joys of Duke TIP.  If I recall correctly, all three sons scored
over 90th percentile on the ACT while in seventh grade.

[4] Probably Middle Son.

[5] While we did not discuss the legendary Rebelsky Test, we did consider
whether or not "You do pretentious music major well" is a compliment.

[6] In the weeks leading up to the discussion one Son posted a question of
"Do people really say 'This is too hard Iâ€™m doing something easier'?  That
seems like a horrible way to live."

[7] We committed to five book club meetings this summer.

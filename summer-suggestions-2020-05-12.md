**_This musing is in draft form!_**

The pandemic has brought complications and difficulties to many (all).
I lack the knowledge and skills to help others deal with most of those,
but I can sometimes provide a bit of advice.  Right now, many Grinnell
CS majors are facing the challenge of what to do this summer.  Some had
their internships canceled.  Some were waiting for an offer.  Some still
hadn't figured out what to do this summer; things changed quickly.

The CS department and its faculty have started to hear questions from
students.  "What should I do now?"  This musing serves as my draft of a
message to go out to our students.  I may even try to keep it up to date
as I get more suggestions.

Dear CS Students,

I hope that you are well (physically, mentally, and emotionally) during
these troubling times and that your semesters are wrapping up well.

We've been receiving questions about what to do this summer from
many of you, particularly those who have lost summer internships.
Unfortunately, we are unlikely to be able to provide any additional
opportunities through the CS department (we did ask).  But we're happy
to try to support you in trying to think about other possibilities.

I've heard that there are still some remote internships on Handshake.
It's worth checking there.  I don't know how many, if any, of those
are paid, but they could be good experiences.  CLS might be able
to provide some funding, but I'm not sure how much. It may be worth
reaching out to Sarah Barks for advice.

We know that some of you need to make money to support yourselves
or your families.  Unfortunately, we can't provide you with any good
advice for finding either remote or local jobs.  Please know that our
thoughts are with you.  

We've been told that the $2400 "scholarship grants" that the College
has been giving out are intended to offset your expected summer
work contributions.  I don't know if that makes things less
anxiety-inducing, but I hope it does.

Okay, on to ideas of what you might do (related to computing) if you 
have some time.

* You might develop a *personal project*.  That is, identify a piece
  of software that you would use and that is not available (or not
  affordable or open source).

* You might contribute to an *open-source project*.  Find something 
  meaningful to you and start to dig in.  Read the source code.  Join
  the discussion group.  Look at the bug reports and feature requests.
  See how you can help.  If you're not sure where to get started with
  open source, there are a few sites designed to help.

    * <https://www.firsttimersonly.com/>
    * <https://opensource.com/life/16/1/6-beginner-open-source>

* You might teach yourself a new language or a new framework.  (You
  can even do this in the context of your personal project or open-source
  project.)  Or you might delve more deeply into a language you already
  know.  I have no idea what is "hot" right now, but I have heard that
  it's good to know React.  We don't teach phone app development in our
  curriculum, so you might try that.  Smalltalk was one of the first
  real object-oriented languages and its modern versions can still 
  help you think differently about programming.

* You might do some of the *practice problems* in the collections
  of good problems out there, perhaps in a new language or a new
  framework.  Here are some.  I admit that I don't have a good sense
  of what people use now.

     * <https://projecteuler.net/>
     * <https://www.hackerrank.com/>
     * <https://leetcode.com/>

* You might *start a 'blog* on technology.  I know very little about
  good 'blogging (and I'm probably the only person left in the world
  who puts an apostrophe at the start of "'blog" to acknowledge
  that it's a contraction of "weblog").  Philip Kiely knows a lot,
  and has a book out that might help, which you can find at
  <https://philipkiely.com/wfsd/>.  I expect that if you are a
  Grinnell student and send PK a note, he'll send you a free copy.

* You might *develop resources* for your peers.  For example, do 
  interviews with a dozen CS alums and gather information from those
  interviews.  (You could build the list of languages and frameworks
  to learn that I was unable to present above.)  Sarah Barks says
  that things like alumni profiles or tips for future CS students 
  could find a home on the STEM Career Community GrinnellShare subsite: 
  <https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/OAS/CLS/STEM/SitePages/Home.aspx>.
  As you might expect, I'd prefer a more public location.

* You might work your way through one or more *great texts in CS*.
  One favorite is, of course, _Structure and Interpretation of
  Computer Programs_, 
  <https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html>
  I like Sandi Metz's _Practical Object-Oriented Design in
  Ruby_, <https://www.poodr.com/>, to gain a broader idea of OOP beyond
  what we teach in 207 (and even 324, although perhaps it's just a
  different view than 324).  You might find it interesting to read
  the original _Design Patterns_ book.  The Association of Computing
  Machinery has a list of 25 classics at
  <https://dl.acm.org/collections/classics>.

  Speaking of the ACM, I would strongly encourage you to consider a
  student ACM membership which, at last count, gives you access to
  O'Reilly's Safari platform.  I know the Metz book is on it, as are
  most of the O'Reilly titles and much more.  If the $18 membership
  fee is a stretch, let me know and I'll pay it for you.  (This offer
  applies only to Grinnell students.)

* You could try one of the *popular MOOCs* for learning something new
  (and for getting practice with online learning).  EdX
  <https://www.edx.org/> and Coursera <https://www.coursera.org/>
  are two of the most popular platforms.  I think both of them still
  have free options, but they may be hidden.

That's about it for now.  Make sure that you also find ways to take
care of your physical, emotional, and mental wellness!  Go out for
a walk.  Do yoga.  Video chat with friends.  Whatever works for you.

Regards,

-- SamR, for the CS department

p.s. The ideas in this message were developed in collaboration with the
faculty in the CS department.  Sarah Barks and Philip Kiely provided
additional suggestions. (I, not Philip, suggested his book.)

p.p.s. I've posted this message to my 'blog.  If I get suggestions
and corrections, I may update it.  You can find it at

**_This musing is in draft form.  Do not read it unless you've been told to do so._**

In [a paired musing](tutorial-2020-07-16.md), I presented an
introductory letter to my students.  At the conclusion of that
letter, I included my answers to the questions that they had been
asked to answer for their not-yet-known advisor.  The last question
was to provide a list of courses for the fall.

Once I started writing these notes, I realized that my "'blogger
voice" had taken over. It seemed best not to present them directly 
to the students in an email message and I'm too lazy to undertake 
a rewrite [1,2].  

I wasn't sure whether I ad to pretend to be a first-year student again.
I decided that no particular model worked.  I'm going to pretend that
the person I am now is going back to college, although perhaps with
fewer of my college classes completed.  I'm (mostly) sticking to
100-level classes.

Do you have access to a list of classes?  Did my advisees?  Right
now, when I visit [my _de facto_ source for the list of
courses](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/), I
see that every course is now listed as "Cancelled".  I guess I'll
be relying on incomplete information.

_14. List below several courses you are interested in taking during the first two Fall terms. The typical schedule for new students is 3 courses plus the First-Year Tutorial and the First Year Experience, across two terms (Fall 1 and Fall 2), for a total of 16+ credits. We encourage you to list at least 6 possible courses so that you and your adviser have a number of ideas to consider. Consult [Academic Planning for New Students](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/academic-advising/resources/new-student-planning) for suggestions on planning a well-balanced schedule._

* ANT-295-01, _ST: Jews, Multiculturalism, and Anitsemitism_.  I have
  not explored enough of my Jewish identity.  College seems to be the
  place to do that.  Plus, I hear that Professor Gibel Mevorach is
  awesome.  (Yes, it's okay to take a course because you've heard
  great things about the professor.  You should also know that 
  what is great for one person may not be great for another.)
  Whoops.  This isn't a 100-level class.  Oh well.  I'm still including it.
* ARH-160-01, _Introduction to Museum Studies_.  I like museums.  I'd
  like to find ways to think more broadly about them.  (How's that for
  a shallow rationale.)
* ART-134-01 or ART-134-02, _Drawing_.  Studio Art is a potential major
  (or so I'm pretending).  I didn't have a chance to take it when I
  last took art classes.
* ART-195-01, _Introduction to Film Studies_.  A starting point for a
  possible independent major in film studies.

Hmmm ... Four courses, and I'm only through the A departments.  "At least
six" should not be hard.

* BIO-150, _Introduction to Biological Inquiry_.  Student Sam has
  heard that this course is one of the highlight's of Grinnell's
  science program.  (Faculty member Sam has said so.)  Rather than
  a giant overview of the field, we get to "be" scientists, reading
  the literature, designing an experiment, conducting the experiment,
  presenting the results.  Sounds cool.  I just want to be able to
  pick the one that sounds most interesting to me.  Plus, I hear
  that some sections will be offered in person [3].
* CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_.  Computer Science is a possible
  major, or so I'm pretending.  And I will be taking this course, at least
  in some interpretation, since I'm teaching it.
* ECN-111, _Introduction to Economics_.  I have no desire to major in
  Economics.  But I feel like I should know something about it.  Maybe
  I'll put this off until another year.  Let's leave it as a fallback.
* ENG-121, _Introduction to Shakespeare_.  I enjoyed my study of 
  Shakespeare in high school.  I'd like to continue.
* GLS-195, _ST: Japanese Science Fiction_.  I love science fiction.
  (Yeah, not the best reason, I know.) I'd look forward to the 
  opportunity to study a different cultural approach.
* LIN-114, _Introduction to General Linguistics_.  I'm interested in how
  language works and how languages form.  I know Grinnell does not have
  a linguistics major; perhaps this is a chance to consider an 
  independent major.  Or perhaps I can combine this with my other
  potential independent major and do one on "The Language of Film".
  (While that would be fun, I don't think one could really treat
  linguistics and film studies as a combined major, at least not
  in that way.  I'm also not sure how a film studies major and a
  language of film major differ.)
* MAT-215, _Linear Algebra_.  I suppose I should channel pre-college
  Sam and consider the course that I would have started with.  Plus,
  I expect every tutee to list at least one math class.
* PHI-111, _Introduction to Philosophy_.  A liberal education without
  philosophy seems woefully incomplete.
* POL-101, _Introduction to Political Science_.  I'd live to have some
  background to understand what is happening in America (and the
  world) these days.
* PSY-113, _Introduction to Psychology_.  I should do a lab science.
  Mom was a psychologist.  I should understand more of what she did.
* RUS-101, _Beginning Russian I_.  Everyone should start their career
  with a language (other than their native language).  I'd like to
  learn one a bit different.
* STA-209, _Applied Statistics_.  It feels like one needs to know
  statistics to understand the world today.  Also a potential part
  of my potential math major.
* THD-115, _Theatrical Design and Technology_.  My friends (okay, my
  kids) took this course elsewher eand said it's really wonderful.

And I mustn't forget my two one-credit classes.

* MUS-120-16, _Perf: Banjo_.  I tell my students to take music lessons.
  I should take them, too.  Taking up a new instrument seems fun.  I
  would also consider others, perhaps trying a different one each
  semester.  I should consider Voice, but that might torture the poor
  instructor.
* PHE-100-25, _Beginning Tennis_.  Such a great sport.  Let's hope my
  knees can keep up.

How did I do?  I have at least six courses.  I have a language
course and a math course, as required.  I have listed courses in
multiple potential majors: Studio Art, CS, Mathematics, Film Studies,
and Linguistics.  I have the required music and wellness courses.

Yeah, I'm one of those students for whom the primary advising task
is narrowing choices.  But that's also good; if a course gets closed,
it's easy to find fallbacks.  So what would I suggest for myself?
(That is, what would Sam as an advisor suggest for the Sam who lists
too many courses?)  Ideally, we'd have a conversation.  But let's
be a bit more directive.

A\. Take a language in your first semester.  Plan to continue it in your
second semester.

> Done.  I'm taking Russian.

_B\. I recommend that you continue mathematics.  Since you said that 
Mathematics is a prospective major, take either MAT-215, _Linear
Algebra_, or STA-209, _Applied Statistics_.

> Statistics is not Math.  I'll take it at some point, but for now
I'd rather focus on making progress in the major.  Let's go with
MAT-215.

_C\. Try something different than those two.  You could consider
divisional diversity and add a social studies course.  It doesn't
sound like economics or political science are prospective majors.
But you'll never know until you try.  Or would you rather explore
something different in other ways, such as _Drawing_ or _Philosophy_?
While both are in the same division as Russian, they are no closer
to Russian than they are to, say, Applied Statistics._

> Can I do ART-195-01, _ST: Intro to Film Studies_?  Didn't you say
  that we should try special topic courses because they might not be
  offered again.

_D\. Take music lessons.  They are included in your tuition.  They
give you a chance to explore your creative side._

> Banjo!

_E\. Take a wellness course, which most typically means a physical
education course.  I know it's trite, but a healthy body supports
a healthy mind._

> Beginning Tennis.

Great.  We'll cross our fingers that this all works out.  But I
should warn you that courses do fill at Grinnell.  That's a side
effect of having small classes.  There have been semesters in which
Linear Algebra is not open to first-years.  I expect the film
studies course will be popular.  Can we have fallbacks?

> Sure.  How do I indicate those?

We've now reached a difficult point in the simulated advising session.
If we had a traditional first semester, we'd discuss how to optimize the
first-year selection sheet.  That would include looking at current
enrollments.  But we're not doing a traditional first semester.  And
the faculty have not yet been told what first-year enrollment will look
like [4].  Maybe I'll learn at the Tutorial sessions next week.

Should I have told myself to take CSC 151?  It's an awesome course.
I'm not sure my Tutorial students should have to put up with two
courses with me, one in each term.  We'll have sections available
in spring [5].  If it were a high priority, I'd support the
decision.  I'd also warn them that it fills (and tell them that,
in my experience, any student who wants 151 in their first year
will get it in their first year).  So let's leave things as they are.

---

Speaking of spring, we might lay some groundwork for spring in this
discussion [6].

F\. Plan to continue Russian.

> Ok.

G\. You said CS was a prospective major.  If that's really the case,
you should take CSC 151 in the spring.

> Ok.

H\. It would be good to explore another prospective major.

> Linguistics! [7]

I\. Let's plan to fill in the fourth course later.  I'd suggest
getting one of the social studies courses in during your first
year.  Maybe political science, so that you can figure out what
happened in the election.

> Ok. [8]

J\. You'll need a music course and a wellness course in the spring.
We'll also discuss those later, after you've had more time to
acclimate to Grinnell.

> Ok.

Course selections!  Explanations!  A mock advising session!  Mockery!
What else could you want?

Oh, I know.  Real people.  Real discussion.  I look forward to hearing
what my tutees are considering and to help them in their planning.

---

[1] To be honest, I could not come up with a good way to rewrite
my list with an appropriate tone.

[2] To be honest, writing them this way feels more honest to who I am
or would be as a student.

[3] Should one trust hearsay?

[4] Does anyone know what first-year enrollment will look like, or is that
process still being designed?  I don't know.

[5] I'm not sure whether or not I'll be teaching one of those.

[6] I have that discussion planned for later in the term, but sometimes
it happens naturally as part of the discussion.

[7] Not an official major.  We'd need to have that conversation.

[8] It appears that I'm an agreeable student.

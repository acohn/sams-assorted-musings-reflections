Where was everybody?
====================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

Last night, I went to an excellent discussion session with Cristina
Henríquez, author of this year's Grinnell Common Read, _The Book
of Unknown Americans_.  Today, I saw another conversation with
Henríquez during Convocation.  I found Henríquez to be thoughtful,
articulate, and occasionally incredibly funny.  From her discussions
of how literature helps us empathize, even with characters we
dislike, to her stories of her writing process, to her perspective
on keeping things, my time at these sessions was time incredibly well
spent.

Nonetheless, I'm freeling incredibly frustrated.

Why?

I guess I should start by paraphrasing the words of a colleague who arrived
with a minute or two to spare at the Convocation conversation.

> I thought it would be standing-room-only by this time.  *Where is 
everybody?* 

I felt the same way.  I showed up thirty minutes early last night
so that I could get a seat near the speakers [1].  I hadn't needed
to do so.  There were many spaces left by the time her talk started.
There were even free copies of her book left [2].

More than four-hundred students should have read Henríquez' compelling
book.  A good number of faculty, staff, and community members read
the book and participated in conversations about the book.  And
it's a really good book.  The book is also supposed to be at the
center of conversations about diversity and inclusion, which are
topics that most of us care deeply abaout.  You would think that
we'd have a healthy crowd at each event, even though people at
Grinnell are usually busy.

Where was everybody?

Sometimes I hate this place.  Maybe it's time to make Convocation
as mandatory as we've made the First Year Experience.

Oh well, at least I got to hear two good conversations and had the
opportunity to compare Henríquez' answers to similar questions.  I
would have liked to have heard her read a bit from her book, but I
guess I can always listen to the audiobook version [4].

Postscript: It seems like this visit would have been a great opportunity to
partner with Writers @ Grinnell.  But I saw little evidence of such
collaboration.  I wonder if that would have made a difference.

[1] The mechanical devices.  Not Henríquez and Arner.

[2] The books were free in the sense that the College [3] paid for them.
Since it's hard to get a Kindle book signed, I was happy to get a hardcopy.

[3] Or a grant to the College.

[4] She does not read the audiobook.  She said that they got a cast of
readers so that each narrator in the book gets their own voice.

Where was everybody?
====================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

Last night, I went to an excellent discussion session with Cristina
Henríquez, author of this year's Grinnell Common Read, _The Book
of Unknown Americans_.  Today, I saw another conversation with
Henríquez at Scholars' Convocation.  I found Henríquez to be
thoughtful, articulate, and occasionally incredibly funny.  From
her discussions of how literature helps us empathize, even with
characters we dislike, to the stories of her writing process, to
her perspective on keeping things, to her comments on the meaning
of the term "American", my time at these sessions was time incredibly
well spent.

Nonetheless, I'm feeling fairly frustrated.

Why?

I guess I should start by paraphrasing the words of a colleague who arrived
with a minute or two to spare at the Convocation conversation.

> I thought it would be standing-room-only by this time.  *Where is 
everybody?* 

I felt the same way.  I showed up thirty minutes early last night
so that I could get a seat near the speakers [1].  But that wasn't
really necessary.  I was one of the first few to arrive.  There
were still many spaces left by the time her talk started.  There
were even free copies of her book left [2].  At least I got to spend
the extra thirty minutes with art.

More than four-hundred students should have read Henríquez' compelling
book.  A good number of faculty, staff, and community members read
the book and participated in conversations about the book.  And
it's a really good book.  The book is also supposed to be at the
center of campus conversations about diversity and inclusion, topics
that most of us care deeply about.  You would think that we'd have
a healthy crowd at each event, even though people at Grinnell are
usually busy.

So where was everybody?

Sometimes I hate this place.  Maybe it's time to make Convocation
as mandatory as we've made the First Year Experience.

Oh well, at least I got to hear two good conversations and had the
opportunity to compare Henríquez' answers to similar questions.  I
would have liked to have heard her read a bit from her book, but I
guess I can always listen to the audiobook version [4].

Postscript: It seems like Henríquez' visit would have been a great
opportunity to partner with Writers @ Grinnell.  But I saw little
evidence of such collaboration.  I wonder if that would have made
a difference.

and Arner.

[2] The books were free in the sense that the College [3] paid for them.
Since it's hard to get a Kindle book signed, I was happy to get a hardcopy.

[4] She does not read in the audiobook.  She said that she asked
them to get a cast of readers so that each narrator in the book
gets their own voice.

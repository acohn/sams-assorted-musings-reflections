Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Corlis Benefideo
==============================================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnellians](index-grinnellians)*

This October appears to be a month in which people introduce
me to Grinnellians *I* should know (or know about).  Not only
did I learn about [Claire Patterson](claire-patterson)
a few weeks ago, but a friend just wrote to ask if
I've heard of Corlis Benefideo; he'd just heard about him [on the
radio](https://www.symphonyspace.org/selected-shorts/episodes/ways-of-seeing-guest-host-maulik-pancholy)
and thought that Benefideo was a Grinnellian I should know.

Particularly as Grinnell extends its reach through the "Global Grinnell"
program, Benefideo is a name you should also know.  He's one of the few
Grinnellilans with an award named after him [1], one awarded by the North
American Cartographic Society.  The primary criterion for the award
is "The potential of their work to transform our ways of seeing and
understanding the world".  Isn't it great that a Grinnellian is associated
with such an approach? 

Benefideo was a creative cartographer and an author (under various pen
names) of deeply thoughtful and carefully mapped books about Bogotá,
Cape Town, Djakarta, Perth, Lagos, Tokyo, and Venice.  His maps inside and
outside the book showed creative and innovative approaches.  Here's what
one commentator notes about some of Benefideo's maps of Tokyo.

> Even without language to identify information in the keys, even without
titles, I could decipher what a mapmaker was up to. One designated
areas prone to flooding as water from the Sumida River backed up through
the city's storm drains. Another showed the location of all the shops
dealing in Edo Period manuscripts and artwork. Another, using small
pink arrows, showed the point of view of each of Hiroshige's famous
One Hundred Views. Yet another showed, in six time-sequenced panels,
the rise and decline of horse barns in the city.

I've had difficulty learning much about Benefideo's career at Grinnell.
The one biographical note I found says that,

> Benefideo was born in Fargo, North Dakota, in 1912. He went to work
for the federal government straight out of Grinnell College during the
Depression and by 1940 was traveling to various places---Venice, Bogotá,
Lagos---in an exchange program.

I must admit that everything I know about Benefideo comes from a single
source, an article by Barry Lopez entitled "[The Mappist](http://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/7040_TheMappistLopez.pdf)" [2].

And, well, I'm pretty sure that "The Mappist" is fiction.  The story appears
to be an homage to Borges, at least in my reading.  It has the rhythm and
tone of a Borges story.  It has the slightly fantastical and slightly
scholarly approach of a Borges story, or at least stories like "Tlön,
Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" [3].

But the Corlis Benefideo award?  It's
[real](http://nacis.org/awards/corlis-benefideo-award/), and is awarded
for "imaginative cartography".  NACIS says that 

> Mr[.] Benefideo is a fictional cartographer, the central character in
Barry Lopez's short story, [T]he Mappist, which is printed in his short
story collection _Light Action in the Caribbean_.   We've adopted his
name for our award with Mr[.] Lopez's blessing.

Should his reality, or lack thereof, make a difference?  I think not.
We claim as Grinnellians famous people who attended Grinnell, but never
graduated.  Why not claim fictitious graduates, too?

In any case, I'd recommend that you read [4] the story.  I'm thankful that
a friend pointed me toward it.  As you read it, consider the ways that
maps can be used not only to inform, but also to lead people to think
about things in new ways [5].

Postscript: Someone should create a Wikipedia page for Benefideo.
And it would be cool to see someone generate some of the maps that Lopez
describes.

[1] There is, as one might expect, a [C.C. Patterson
award](https://www.geochemsoc.org/honors/awards/ccpattersonaward).
SIGCSE has a Henry Walker travel award.  Grinnell has awards named
after alums, but that's not the same thing.  I don't know of others, but I
look forward to hearing from my readers.

[2] You can also listen to "The Mappist" on [an episode of _Selected Shorts_ on "Ways of Seeing"](https://www.symphonyspace.org/selected-shorts/episodes/ways-of-seeing-guest-host-maulik-pancholy).

[3] I'm pretty sure that that's the Borges story that comes to mind.

[4] Or listen to it.

[5] I suppose I do need to include mapping in the FunDHum course.

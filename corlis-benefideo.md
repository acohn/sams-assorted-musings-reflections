Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Corlis Benefideo
==============================================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnellians](index-grinnellians)*

This appears to be a month in which people introduce me to Grinnellians
*I* should know (or know about).  Not only did I learn about [Claire
Patterson](claire-patterson) a few weeks ago, but a friend just wrote
to ask if I've heard of Corlis Benefideo; he'd just heard about him on
the radio and thought that he was a Grinnellian I should know.

Particularly as Grinnell extends its reach through the "Global Grinnell"
program, Benefideo is a name you should also know.  He's one of the few
Grinnellilans with an award named after him, one awarded by the North
American Cartographic Society.  The primary criterion for the award
is "The potential of their work to transform our ways of seeing and
understanding the world".  Isn't it great that a Grinnellian is associated
with such an approach? 

Benefido was a creative cartographer and an author (under various pen
names) of deeply thoughtful (and carefully mapped) books about Bogotá,
Cape Town, Djakarta, Perth, Lagos, Tokyo, and Venice.  His maps inside and
outside the book showed creative and innovative approaches.  Here's what
one commentator notes about some of Benefideo's maps of Tokyo.

> Even without language to identify information in the keys, even without
titles, I could decipher what a mapmaker was up to. One designated
areas prone to flooding as water from the Sumida River backed up through
the city's storm drains. Another showed the location of all the shops
dealing in Edo Period manuscripts and artwork. Another, using small
pink arrows, showed the point of view of each of Hiroshige's famous
One Hundred Views. Yet another showed, in six time-sequenced panels,
the rise and decline of horse barns in the city.

I've had difficulty learning much about Benefideo's career at Grinnell.
The one biographical note I found says that,

> Benefideo was born in Fargo, North Dakota, in 1912. He went to work
for the federal government straight out of Grinnell College during the
Depression and by 1940 was traveling to various places---Venice, Bogotá,
Lagos---in an exchange program.

I must admit that everything I know about Benefideo comes from a single
source, an article by Barry Lopez entitled "[The Mappist](http://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/7040_TheMappistLopez.pdf)".

And, well, I'm pretty sure it's fiction.  The story reads as an homage to
Borges, at least in my reading.  It has the rhythm and tone of a Borges
story.  It has the slightly fantastical and slightly scholarly approach
of a Borges story, or at least stories like "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius".

But the Corlis Benefideo award?  It's [real
](http://nacis.org/awards/corlis-benefideo-award/), and is awarded for
"imaginative cartography".

We claim as Grinnellians famous people who attended Grinnell, but never 
graduated.  Why not claim fictitious graduates, too?

In any case, I'd recommend that you read the story.  I'm thankful that
a friend pointed me toward it.

Postscript: Someone should create a Wikipedia page for Benefideo.
And it would be cool to see someone generate some of the maps that Lopez.

Meta-reviewing
==============

*Topics/tags: [Overcommitment](index-overcommitment), writing, academia*

Different disciplines and subdisciplines have very different approaches to
conferences, from the prestige associated with conference presentation
to the process by which one decides what papers are to be presented
at the conference.  In some disciplines, a conference is a place to
test out ideas, and the submissions are reviewed lightly, perhaps
primarily for theme.  In contrast, in many subdisciplines of computer
science, submissions are reviewed carefully, by multiple reviewers,
the acceptance rate is comparatively low [1], and the proceedings are
considered an archival form of publication [2].  If I recall correctly,
there's a report from the National Academy of Arts and Sciences that
says that computer scientists value conference publications because they
allow us to get results out in a much more timely fashion than journal
publication permits.

This week, I've been playing my part in the review process for one
conference, SIGCSE [3].  To explain that part, I need to explain more
about the SIGCSE reviewing process.  SIGCSE is a relatively competitive
conference with about a 30% acceptance rate for papers.  Each SIGCSE
paper gets five or six reviews [4].  Then an associate program chair
(APC) moderates a discussion amongst the reviewers and, after a
week or so of discussion, writes a "meta-review" that summarizes the
strengths and weaknesses identified the by the reviewers and makes
a recommendation.  The Program Chairs then use the meta-reviews to put
together the conference program, making adjustments as appropriate [5].
I don't envy them that job.

Anyway, this year, as in many years [7], I'm serving as an APC for SIGCSE
[8].  When I first served as an APC, we had to write meta-reviews for
somewhere over twenty papers.  It's gotten better.  Now we only have to
do eight or nine papers.  However, we do have to spend more time moderating
and encouraging discussion than we used to.

We're close to the deadline for meta-reviews, so I spent much of today
writing those meta-reviews.  In order to write a meta-review, I revisit
the paper and the reviews, reflect on the positives and negatives the
reviewers have raised, consider further issues raised in discussions,
and attempt to put that all together in a comparatively concise piece that
serves both the conference chairs and the authors.  While my primary job
is to reflect the recommendations of the reviewers, I will also insert
some of my own comments when I think they will help the authors prepare
better final papers for this year or revised submissions for the future
[9].

Writing meta-reviews takes time.  If I count correctly, I wrote about
2600 words of meta-reviews today [10], or about 325 words per meta-review.
I know from experience that a tightly-packed, 9pt, two-column,
8.5x11 inch page [11] has about 850 words and I see from the Interweb
that [a more traditional single-spaced page of text has about 500
words](https://anycount.com/WordCountBlog/how-many-words-in-one-page/).

Five pages of writing should be enough for a day.  But I also had a musing
to write.  Hence, you get this musing.  I had initially assumed it would
be shorter [12], but it appears that my muse wanted me to provide you
with more of the backstory.

Let's hope that I can get five pages of real writing done tomorrow.  And
let's hope that after those five pages, I'll still have some ability and
inclination to muse.

[1] I believe it's as low as 10% (and perhaps lower) for some top-tier 
conferences.  However, my quick check suggests that [the acceptance rate
for the top conferences in theory](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~sikora/ratio/confs.php) is about 25%, [the acceptance rate for CHI, the top conference in human-computer interaction](http://chi2018.acm.org/blog/) is also about 25%.

[2] That means that you don't get to republish the work elsewhere.

[3] Officially, the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education,
or so I believe.

[4] Once in a while, they get only four reviews.

[5] I considered writing about the adjustments they make.  But I've never
been a SIGCSE program chair [6], so I don't know that what I'd write would
be accurate.

[6] And I'll probably never be a program chair.

[7] If I count correctly, this is my seventh year as an APC.

[8] Am I allowed to mention that?  I think so.  SIGCSE usually publishes
a list of the APCs.  It also appears in my CV.

[9] From my perspective, the review process has two primary goals: It
helps the conference select the better papers, and it helps the authors
improve their work.

[10] Yes, I also edited what I wrote, at least a bit.

[11] That is, a typical page in the SIGCSE conference proceedings.

[12] "I wrote reviews today.  They totaled 2600 words.  I have no
writing energy left to muse.  Deal."

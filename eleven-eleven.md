It's November 11, or 11/11.  It's Veterans' Day [1].  It's also Armistice
Day [2].  If you have not done so already, take a moment to thank any
veterans you know [3].

When I think of 11/11, I often reflect on Walt Kelly's _Pogo_.  I recall
that the 11/11 Pogo strips were often subdued and thoughtful.  I remember
appreciating them as a child, but I don't think I understood the deeper
meaning that Kelly was trying to convey.  But I recall that I always
enjoyed the November 11 strips, most of which I read in reprints.

Given the special status of 11/11, I was surprised at the difficulty
I had finding anything about Kelly's use of the date.  I looked for
entries about "Armistice Day", "Veterans Day", "Dates", and "November
11", in _The Pogopedia_ [4], but found nothing.  I had hope for _Pogo
Files for Pogophiles_ [5], but I'd forgotten that that book is primarily
a set of articles, rather than broad coverage.

Finally, with some effort, I found a note from Kelly in _Ten Every Lovin'
Blue-Eyed Years with Pogo_ [6] that is almost certainly what was
sitting at the back of my head.

> The eleventh day of the eleventh month has always seemed to me to
be special.  Even if the reason for it fell apart as the years went
on, it was a symbol of something close to the high part of the heart.
Perhaps a life that stretched through two or three ways takes its
first war rather seriously, but I still think we should have kept the
name "Armistice Day."  Its implications were a little more profound,
a little more hopeful. (p. 100)

I can see a ten-year-old Sam remembering "eleventh day of the eleventh
month" but not understanding everything else in that paragraph.

What about the strips?  Here are a few.

_November 11, 1949_

> Panel one.  Owl is speaking while Albert and Pogo are sitting on 
a bench.  Porky walks in from panel right with an alarm clock.

> > Owl: On this occasion I step proudly to this rostrum, head high, 
    chin out, eyes fastened on a not so distant past .... a past full
    of striving, full of immeasurable sacrifice .... full, I cry, of
    glory!  Aye, my friends, through tear-speckled bi-focals, I behold Ah-Hmm-A-Boop-Haw-Hph- ...

> > Porky: **HOLD IT!  Hold it!**  Time for a full minute of silence.

> Panel two.  All four characters quiet, looking thoughtful.

> Panel three.  Pogo and Albert seated.  Porky standing.  Owl walking
toward the right.

> > Albert: Now, what was you a-sayin' Howlan' Owl?

> > Owl: Aw, I dunno ... I wasn't really listenin'.

In _Walt Kelly and Pogo: The Art of the Political Swamp_ [7], James Eric
Black describes the strip as follows.

> November 11, 1949, was Armistice Day.  The strip was a simple recognition
of the holiday dedicated to the cause of world peace.  

_November 11, 1950_

> Panel one: Churchy, Pogo, Porky, Albert, and Owl sitting on a log, viewed 
three-quarters from behind, at sunset.

> > Churchy: The sunset there to the west makes me feel like makin'
    a speech.

> > Pogo: Whpf!

> > Albert: We had a speech once .... by Owl ... last  year.

> Panel two: Same characters, now viewed from the front.  A pond is
visible in the foreground.

> > Owl [In a word balloon that implies whispering]: This year even owl is
speechless.

Black writes

> The mood of the strip was much different the following year when it
became more obvious that world peace could not be completely achieved.
[...] This is an important strip for Kelly for many reasons.  It is a rare
two-panel with little interaction between the characters.  Kelly uses both
the depth and darkness in the first panel to set the mood.  "The sunset
there to the west" refers to the conflict across the Pacific in Korea.
[...] The darkness of the mood is significant because the previous
year's strip occurred during a time of peace.  Three months before this
second strip, the United States joined a United Nations "police action"
to protect South Korea from aggression by its northern counterpart.

_November 11, 1953_

> Panel one: Churchy, Pogo, and Porky sitting in a boat named "Ol'
Deems Taylor [8].  Churchy looks a bit stunned, Pogo and Porky
look thoughtful.  No dialog.

> Panel two: Same boat.  Different angle.  No dialog.

> Panel three: Same boat, another angle.  Porky speaks.

> > Y'know, it seems to me this is all backwards ... We, ever'body,
ought to keep our mouths shut all the whole year long so's we'd have
time to think of two minutes worth of something' to say on the eleventh
day of November.

_November 11, 1954, labeled "Armistice Day 1954"_

> Panel one: Beauregard is in his dog house.  Rackety Coon Chile is
running toward the house.  It's raining.

> > Beauregard: Hurry on in here, Chile ....

> > Rackety Coon Chile: I'se doin' my best, Uncle Beauregard.

> Panel two: Inside the house, looking toward front door.  Rackety Coon
Chile is drying himself off with a _Fort Mudge Most_ towel.  Beauregard is
looking out the door.

> > Rackety Coon Chile: Whee-oosh!  What a day!

> > Beauregard: Perfeckly beautiful.

> Panel three: Inside the house, same perspective.  Rackety Coon Chile now
has the towel at his side.  Beauregard is lying down, facing outward.

> > Rackety Coon Chile: Beautiful!?  What's so beautiful about it?

> > Beauregard: Wull ... It's November Ee-leventh .. [word balloon
continues into next panel]

> Panel four: Outside the house, looking in.  Both Beauregard and
Rackety Coon Chile are looking out the door.

> > Beauregard [word balloon continues from prior panel]: .. An' it's
better to have what we got of it than to never of had it at all.

_November 11, 1957, labeled "Armistice Day, 1957"_

> Panel one: Porky and Pogo are riding on the pond in what looks
to be a soda crate labeled "Barkle Sparkle".

> > Porky: Whatever happened to that plan 'bout atoms for peace?

> > Pogo: Must of dropped it.

> Panel two: Still in crate, different perspective.

> > Porky: Didn't drop the bomb tho, did they?

> > Pogo: Ain't heard no reports.

> Panel three: Still in crate, moving to the distance.

> > Porky: An' what happened to disarmament? ... Anybody drop a gun yet?

> > Pogo: You got me.

> Panel four: Further in the distance.

> > Porky: I was goin' to ask you what happened to Armistice Day, but
you ain't up on this stuff, are you?

> > Pogo: Nope

I wonder what Kelly would do with our current gun climate?

Kelly didn't write a special strip every year.  November 11, 1951 was a
Sunday strip about returning the bones of a martian to Mars.  November 11,
1952 has Beauregard flirting with Mam'selle Hepzibah and Porky's Uncle
Baldwin bussing the Mam'selle [9].  November 11, 1958 has Pogo talking
to a butterfly.

And that's all I have the energy to track down right now.

Let's see.  Where do we stand?  I was correct in remembering that
November 11 was special to Kelly.  I learned (or re-learned) that
it was special because it was Armistice Day.  However, Kelly was not
steadfast in his use of November 11th to remember Armistice Day.  Oh,
as I reread strips that I haven't read for decades, it was amazing
to see how much they were buried in my brain.

Maybe I'll teach my next Tutorial on Pogo.

[1] Or perhaps Veterans Day, without the apostrophe.

[2] For those readers who are not historically inclined, Armistice day
celebrates the end of the first World War, which, unfortunately, was
not the expected "war to end all wars".

Visiting Mass MoCA
==================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc)*

Yesterday, Eldest Son and I drove west from the Happy Valley to
visit the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, or Mass MoCA.
For those who have not been, Mass MoCA is a converted industrial
site that was once a fabric printing mill [1] and then an electronics
manufacturer.  After it had sat idle for some time, some brilliant folks 
at Williams suggested converting it to a museum for contemporary art.
It was a fantastic idea.

I had gone because I wanted to see the Sol LeWitt wall murals [2].
But I appreciated the wide range of pieces that were there.  I also
appreciated the scope and scale of many pieces.  It appears that
Mass MoCA often gives artists access to full-size rooms (and by
full-size, I mean full-size manufacturing rooms).  It must be an
amazing privilege as an artist to have full control over spaces
that size.

As I visited, I considered whether I wanted to sample everything
or to follow my colleague Jeremy Chen's suggestion to pick a few
pieces and devote significant amounts of time to them.  Since it
was my first visit, I decided I was best off trying to get a sense
of the scope of the place.  Sampling was worthwhile; I appreciated
the scope of works that we were able to see, including LeWitt's
walls, Cauleen Smith's videos and video-related installations,
Trenton Doyle Hancock's somewhat indescribable Mound series, ERRE's
moving piece on the wall entitled Them and Us, some Laurie Anderson
videos [3], Jenny Holzer's overwhelming work with words, Gunner
Schoenbeck's instruments, Annie Lennox's 'Now I Let You Go...', and
James Turrell's light works [4].  We spent six hours there.  I'm
pretty sure that I could have spent a week or more [5].

When I return, there are many individual pieces I need to spend
more time with.  Certainly, the early LeWitt walls command more of
my time, particularly [Wall Drawing
305](https://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing305/), _The location of
one hundred random specific points (The locations are determined
by the drafters)_ and [Wall Drawing
260A](https://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing260a/), _On blue walls,
all two-part combinations of white arcs from corners and sides, and
white straight, not straight, and broken lines within a 36-inch (90
cm) grid_.  I did not spend nearly enough time with Adriana Corral
and Vincent Valdez' _Requiem_; Eldest told me that it was valuable
to read [the accompanying narrative that explains the meaning of
dates](https://issuu.com/massmoca/docs/requiem).  I need more time
with Annie Lennox's 'Now I Let You Go...', in part because I need
to get better at letting physical things go [6].  I'd really like
to see one of the Laurie Anderson limited-visitor pieces, although
I'm not sure that I'd appreciate the VR piece.  And I really need
to spend more time immersed in the Jenny Holzer room.  I'd also
like to bring Middle Son to the Gunner Schoenbeck instrument room.

As I said, I could spend at least another week there.  I wonder when
I'll find the time.

[1] Our tour guide claimed that the residents knew what color was being
printed by the color of the river; I'm not sure if that's really true.

[2] More on those in a future musing.

[3] We were not able to get reservations for either of the limited-entry
Lennox exhibits.

[4] We were able to get into both of Turrell's limited-entry exhibits.
I'm not sure that my pupils dilated enough in his dark-room piece.  But
I enjoyed the darkness.

[5] Although not at one time.

[6] Item 92 is "My Father's Chanter Reeds and Tin Box".  About these, Lennox
writes,

> You need to use special cane reeds to play the chanter.  They're very
challenging to master.  They need to be moistened by saliva until they
can produce a sufficient sound.   It takes time, patience, and a lot of
breath.  My father's breath passed through these reeds.  He kept them in
this small cigar tin.

I don't think I could have gotten rid of something like that,
particularly with that backstory.

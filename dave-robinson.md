**Notes**

*Part of an ongoing series about the people who inhabit or have
inhabited Grinnell's campus.*

Dave Robinson is Grinnell's Chief Information Technology Officer and the
director of Information Technology Services.  Given that he serves those
roles, and what I think about technology on campus, you might think that
he's someone I argue with regularly, and don't particularly respect.
You'd be wrong.  Dave is one of the people I most value on campus.
Let's explore why.

Some reasons have to deal with our personal interactions.

Thoughtful.

Willing to listen and explain.

Gets me to think in different ways.  ("Sam, if we trust this backup
service with the College's most sensitive data, don't you think we
can also trust it with your data?"  (Well, you do trust your data
to Microsoft systems, but ...))  

Knows what he knows and doesn't know (usually - story about HTTP).

Some reasons have to do with his life outside of work.

Does woodworking with his daughter (or at least I hope he still does).

Some reasons have to do with what I see him do.

In an incredibly hard position.  Following two directors who were
disliked (perhaps by different groups).  Both directors build mistrust
among faculty and among ITS staff.

Fighting hard to teach higher-level administration about our real
technology needs.  Responsible for creating new processes and
procedures.

Trying new things.  I think ITS is a leader in applying our implicit
bias procedures to staff hiring.

I was on the committee that hired Dave.  (It's actually the committee
in which I started wearing my "Curmudgeon" nametag.)  We made such a
good decision.

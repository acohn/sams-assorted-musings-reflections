This year's sabbatical
======================

*Topics/tags: [Overcommitment](index-overcommitment), academia, write, long*

I'm on sabbatical this year.  When people hear about the sabbatical, they
tend to ask two questions: _Weren't you on sabbatical last fall?_ and 
_What do you plan to do on sabbatical?_ [1].  The answer to the first question
is a bit more straightforward: I had a fellowship in Fall 2018 and fellowships
are separate from sabbatical [2].  I feel privileged to have had the
fellowship and I plan to continue the work from that fellowship during
my sabbatical.

The answer to the second question is a bit more complex.  A year ago,
when I needed to plan for the sabbatical, I wrote [an extended set of
notes on my plans](sabbatical-2019-draft).  For those who don't want
to read the whole thing, here's the most important paragraph.

> I’m planning four projects: I should put the new CSC 151 materials in a generally-usable form. I should wrap-up the code-camp work, whatever that means. I should rework the mediascheme materials to work only in DrRacket. And I should reboot the MIST project. But how do I discuss and describe those? I also may be working on the SIGCSE volunteer system, but that’s probably not worth mentioning in the application. [3]

But, well, things change.  Among other things, new opportunities [4] arise
and some dry up.  There's also more to sabbatical than the primary projects.
As I sit down to begin my sabbatical, it seems worthwhile to revisit my
plans.

The first answer I give to most people is to pat my belly and say "My 
health is my first priority."  And it really needs to be.  I'm out of
shape.  And my shape is too round.  So exercise and weight loss are
an essential part of sabbatical.  I'm hoping that the reduced stress of
sabbatical [5] will make it easier to find the time to focus on those
issues and that they will remain a focus once I return to work.

When I wrote about planning to write more about the code camps, I had
not yet submitted the latest set of papers on the code camps for review.
I was surprised to find that both were accepted [6].  Given the messiness
of our data [8], I don't think that there's much more I can write for
my professional community about those camps.  However, given the impact
the camps had on our community and the number of requests I've been getting
to offer camps again, it's worth considering how we can continue to offer
them now that the grant has expired [9].

In terms of new opportunities [11], the most significant is that I have
been asked to take a more active role in the ACM Special Interest Group
on Computers and Society.  SIGCAS is an important group, but is struggling
with identity issues and a lack of volunteers.  I've volunteered to help
try to address these challenges.  But working with ACM is, well, a
challenge of its own [12].  I'm also a bit uncomfortable with this much
responsibility.  This sabbatical activity, more than my others, invokes
some anxiety.

As long as we're on the subject of projects not in the sabbatical plan,
I should mention at least one internal project.  Fall 2021 will mark the
50th anniversary of the individually advised curriculum [14].  A sympoisum
on "The liberal arts in the 21st century and the open curriculum", or
some such, seems like a good thing .  When I asked about it recently,
it sounded like no one else was thinking about such a possibility.
It may be that I'm more passionate about the option than others and must
therefore take some lead in moving us forward [16,18].

I hope to be able to teach Tutorial in Fall 2020.  I should spend some of
my sabbatical time planning the topic and readings for that Tutorial.

[1] Some also ask _What's happening to your advisees?_  I'm keeping them.
However, since 30+ graduated in the spring, I'm down to a dozen or so.

[2] And, for the next few years, MAP credits are another thing altogether.

[4] Or expectations.

[5] Fingers crossed.

[6] It was not a typical year; I submitted more things than normal and
had a higher percent than normal accepted.  In addition to two code-camp
papers, I also had a paper with Janet on the software design course
accepted [7] as well as a panel proposal in which I was a panelist.

[7] It even won an award: Second best paper in the experience reports
track.

[8] Among other things, we had not planned for returning students (or
the effects of having returning students) and we found that we had to
modify the instrument midway through the project.

[9] I'll likely muse about the issue in the future.  For now, one idea
is to offer only one camp each summer and make it part of the broader
work of my research team [10].

[10] The odds are that MIST will again take its place as my primary
research project.

[11] Or expectations.

[12] Amazingly, I hear the same thing from almost everyone who works
with ACM.

[14] Also known as the individually mentored curriculum, the open curriculum,
and the no-reqiurements curriculum [15].  

[15] I've probably missed a few other names

[16] That reminds me, now that our new Dean is back on campus, I should
try to schedule a meeting [17].

[17] It was impossible to find a time in the next few weeks that all
fifteen people I've been communicating with could meet.  But I did find
a time that all but one of us could meet.

[18] It also reminds me that I should consider writing an innovation 
fund proposal.  That's also another good topic for a musing.

Finishing five months of daily essays
=====================================

Well, we've reached the end of another month of monthly essays, which
I think makes it five months [1].  It's also the end of the year, but not
really the end of a year of essays.  That's still seven months away.
In any case, since it's the end of the month, it's time to reflect
on my writing for the month.

Last month, I primarily wrote profiles of a variety of Grinnellians.
That was harder than I had expected, but I ended up finding some value
in those essays, and I started getting used to writing that kind of
essay.  Still, I was looking forward to getting back to writing a
wider variety of essays.  

It turned out to be much harder than I expected to get back into the
groove of writing other kinds of essays.  Toward the end of month three,
I had developed a long list of things I was really enthusiastic about
writing about it.  But when I came back to the list this month, few of
the things really struck me.  In part, I think it's because the profiles
put me in a better mood; I feel less inclined to rant about things than
I might otherwise. I think the "rants" I've written recently are less
extreme.

I did realize that I should be getting back to writing "useful" essays,
essays that are intended for a broader audience, such as my early [essays
for prospective students](index-prospective-students).  I didn't write
enough of them.  In part, that's because this month was the end of
the semester, and the end of the semester is a particularly busy one.
Hence, I often felt like I wanted to write, or had to write short essays.

That said, some writing got away from me.  I had thought that [my essay
on linking endnotes](joc-linking-endnotes) would be short.  However, it
ended up being at least twice as long as the average essay.  The original
version of [my essay on Trustees](trustees) included a number of public
rants that it probably should not have contained.  And I'm pretty sure
there were others.

On the subject of linking endnotes, I also wrote some software for the
essays.  One was the software to link the endnotes.  A second piece was
a short script to renumber endnotes, one that allows me to easily insert
a new endnote in the middle of the essay.  It took me much too long to
decide to write that second piece of software.  As a computer scientist
(or at least as a cmputer programmer), I should know that once I've done
the same stupid repetitive task a few times, I should then write software
to automate that task.  At some point, I'll probably write some more
software for the essays.  I think I should write some indexing software.
I'm not sure what else, but I'm sure that something will come up.

Oh, yeah, I'm supposed to reflect on what I've learned about writing.

Harley's comment on my writing: It's reflective, not argumentative.

[1] Yes, I realize that five months of essays should be no more than
155 essays, and this is essay #172.  But, well, I wrote forty essays
in the first go-round, and counted that as only one month; I wrote
"bonus" essays on a number of days; and I ended up moving the end of
the month to the end of the month [2].

[2] That is, rather than calling a month 30 or 31 days from the start
of the essay writing, I started using the last day of the month.

Finishing five months of daily essays
=====================================

*Forthcoming.*

---

Notes:

* Kind of hard to get back in the groove.
* Time felt more limited - often felt like I wanted to write or had to
  write short essays..
* Some writing got away from me.  (The one on making links was supposed
  to be quick.)
* Wrote software to improve the site.

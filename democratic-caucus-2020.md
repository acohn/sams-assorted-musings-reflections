Middle convinced me to caucus for Jimmy Carter, "the most ethical president
we've had in a long time".  I kept hoping somone else would join us as a
strategy; once he became non-viable we would have followed them back to their
preferred candidate.

Someone else noted that the Carter strategy was good because "No preference"
can become viable. (It didn't look like it would, but ....)

The new process, which was supposed to be more efficient, was much less
efficient.  People thought they were no longer viable, switched, then
were told to go back to their original space.

Many people didn't realize that you could become viable in the second
round.  That's a problem.  (I hear that in the Stanford remote Caucus, 
Amy became viable in the second round.)

The form had this wonderful "Only in F(6)C situation" section.  I asked
about it, and no one knew for sure what it meant.  I find that problematic.
I also find it problematic that my brain immediately went to "I wonder
what triggers this section."

Policies on practica and performance
====================================

_**This musing is in draft form.**_

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), [Grinnell](index-grinnell)*

As many readers know, Grinnell has an atypical curriculum, one that
lacks general education requirements.  In fact, Grinnell has only
five primary requirements: Students must take Tutorial, students
must complete a major, students must take at least 124 credits,
at least some number of which must be taken at Grinnell [1], students
must achieve at least a 2.0 grade-point average, and students must
spend some number of semesters in residence at Grinnell [2].  You
can see all of the details on our [Requirements for graduation
page](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=3643).

Grinnell also has some "negative" requirements. The ones that come
immediately to mind are that you can't count more than 48 credits
in any one department toward the 124 credits required for graduation,
you can't count more than 92 credits in any one division toward
graduation [3,5], and you can't count more than eight *practica
credits* toward graduation [6].  Note that these are limits on the
amount you can *count*; many students still take more than these
limits and just accumulate more than 124 credits.

Grinnell also has at least one more negative requirement, one that
has evolved over the time I've been at Grinnell: You can't take
more than eighteen credits in any semester without receiving
permission from the Committee on Academic Standing and, in many
cases, paying extra fees.  There have been some exceptions over the
years.  For example, when students had to pay for their lessons,
we generally approved those extra credits automatically, without
consultation with CAS.  These days, your first music lesson is free
[7], and neither music practica, nor music performance, nor physical
education practica count toward the eighteen-credit limit [8].
Responsibility for approving overloads has also moved from CAS to
the Office of the Registrar.

This year, a new change was made or seems to have been made.  The
following language was added to [the section on
Practica](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2537#practica).

> Credit Limitations [...]  A combined semester maximum of 6 credits in musical group performance (MUS 101), studio instruction (MUS 120, 122, 220, and 221), and recitals (MUS 320 and 420.)

The policy itself is not new.  However, its placement is.  That
policy used to reside under the "[Credit
Limits](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=3643)"
section [9].  It has migrated to new locations.  The meaning changes
significantly when you switch where the policy appears.  In the
original location, it's just another limit of what we count toward
graduation and does not affect any particular semester.  In the new
locations, it affects what a student can do in any semester.

That change bothers me.  It also seems quite strange.  What's wrong
with it?

*It does not acknowledge expectations or workload*.  I have had
music advisees who play two instruments and sing.  At the end of
their careers, those students will typically want to perform recitals
in each (two credits per recital, six credits total) and to continue
performing in their ensembles (another 2 credits).  Those students
will be doing eight credits of real work.  After all, you can't
slack off in either recitals or ensembles.  So why can't they receive
those credits?

I've heard suggests that students deal with these issues by auditing
some of their practica and performance classes.  However, the audit
option does not work for recitals since those are often supervised
by our Applied Music Associates, who must be paid.  What about
ensembles?  Since another policy requires anyone involved in an
ensemble to register, even if they are only participating for one
piece in one performance, "Audit" primarily signifies that kind of
participation.

*It contradicts our advertising*.  The Music Department's "Why
become a music major" signs and [information
page](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-and-concentrations/music/private-lessons)
note that "All majors may take an unlimited number of private lessons
at any level without additional charge." Since it's not possible
to audit lessons, we can't have both policies in place.

*It singles out one department*.  Why should practica and performance
in music be treated differently than practica and performance in
PE or Theatre and Dance or any other department that decides to
offer practica and performance classes?  Why should eight credits
of music practica be treated differently than six credits of music
practica and performance and two of Theatre and Dance practica and
performance?  Why should eight credits of Music be different than
eight credits of PE?

*It undermines faculty governance*.  A significant change in our
requirements should be discussed by the whole faculty, and not
determined by an individual or a committee.  And, even if one
believes that a committee or individual can make the change, that
change should be announced, not hidden.  I'm pretty sure that few
people are aware of the change [11].

---

I can understand that we might have imposed a limit on the number
of practica in a semester when those practica counted toward our
eighteen-credit limit per semester since that would significantly
limit the non-practica courses.  But practica don't count toward
credit limits [12].

I can also understand concerns about student workload.  I certainly
would not advise most students to take eight credits of practica
on top of a sixteen-credit semester.  However, if we limit practica
and performance , the limits should be imposed universally, and not
on a single department [14].  And the decision should be a faculty
decision, not a committee or Deanly decision.

Am I going to raise the matter with appropriate folks?  Probably
not.  I already complain about way too many things.  Since the Music
Department is being singled out, it seems that it is their
responsibility to complain or seek changes.  However, if one of my
advisees is affected by the change in rules, I will.

[1] Sorry, I couldn't easily figure out how many.

[3] The 92 credit limit can be phrased in a positive way, such as
"You must take 32 credits outside the division of your major" [4].

[4] That doesn't quite work for interdisciplinary majors, such as
Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies or the various independent
majors.

[5] For two of the three divisions, the limit makes sense to me.
But I consider the difference between, say, Philosophy and Studio
Art to be as wide as the gap between either discipline and Psychology
or Political Science.

[6] This could also be phrased as a positive requirement: You must
take at least 116 credits of non-practica courses.

[7] More about that in a subsequent musing.

[8] Here's the statement from the [_2019-2020 Student Handbook_](https://catalog.grinnell.edu).

> Approval from the Office of the Registrar is required to carry a semester course load of more than 18 credits. Students registered for more than 18 credits per term are billed the per credit rate for the credits in excess of 18. Musical group performance, studio instruction in music, physical education activities, and varsity sports (MUS 101, MUS 120, MUS 122, MUS 220, MUS 221, MUS 320, MUS 420, PHE 100, and PHE 101) are not counted when determining credits in excess of 18. [10]

[11] Over the past ten years at Grinnell, and mostly over the past
five years, we've seen a significant shift in the interpretation
of "shared governance".  These days, "shared governance" often feels
more like "representative governance", which isn't quite the same.
When I was a young faculty member, representative groups like Council
suggested changes in policy to the faculty, who then provided
commentary and voted on the adoption of those changes.  Now, both
the Dean's office and a number of committees seem to consider it
within their purview to change policy without broader discussion.
I'm hoping that things will get better with our new Dean.  I suppose
I need to muse a bit more on the change in models.

[12] At least Music practica and PE practica don't count toward limits;
I'm not sure about Theatre and Dance practica.

[14] And we need to change our advertising.

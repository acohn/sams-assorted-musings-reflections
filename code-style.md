Teaching code style
===================

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), language, [the joy of code](index-joc)*

Recently, someone posted a question to the SIGCSE-members mailing list in
which they reflected on how CS fits into an institution-wide "Writing across
the curriculum" initiative.  They mentioned something about code style.

One of the first replies went like this.

>  Focusing on style guidelines in code is IMHO like focusing on grammar in prose writing. I think you need to get into a little bit more refactoring, etc.

I couldn't let that stand.  So I wrote a reply.  I started as follows.

> From my perspective, *syntax* in code corresponds to grammar in prose writing.  Just as one can tell the difference between well-written prose and adequately written prose, one can tell the difference between well-written code and adequately written code.

I probably should have put more attention into that paragraph.  Here's a
similar, but better, start.  It makes something implicit explicit.

> From my perspective, *syntax* in code corresponds to grammar in prose writing.  Style is different.  Just as one can tell the difference between well-written prose and adequately written prose, one can tell the difference between well-written code and adequately written code.

After I sent the response, I realized that a longer version would be an
appropriate subject for a musing.  So here goes.

*Original*

In the end, the goal of teaching style is not just correctness or efficiency, it's elegance, broadly defined.  I find it important to teach style to help students understand that they are writing code not just for the computer, but also for other people to read.

I also accept that style in code may be just as hard as style in writing.  In both cases, it takes time to understand what makes good style.  In both, there are some "rubrics" that one can apply, but applying rubrics does not suffice.  In the end, one needs to practice communicating well.

The biggest difference I see is that most of the prose students read has style as a goal.  In contrast, most of the code students see has poor style.

*Some other notes*

Most of the time we read [or at least most of the time that I read], the
style is not immediately obvious.  When you read for content or story, you
don't always pay attention to the exact way the words are organized.  But
sometimes a particular turn of phrase will catch your eye or ear.  Anyone
who writes knows this.

Please chill!
=============

I understand that some alumni and current students are writing
to Dean Latham to complain about the student-faculty ratio in CS.
**Please don't.** I realize that things seem bad right now.  We have
large classes.  We have a large student/faculty ratio in the department.
And I have way too many advisees.  Those are all very real problems.

At the same time, we remain a very strong department.  While we have a
large student/faculty ratio, we have faculty who care very much about
supporting their students, we have a generous peer education budget which
supports a committed corps of peer educators, we have an excellent Peer
Education Coordinator, and we have wonderful students who do a lot to
support each other.  We are supervising 28 summer research students this
year within the department and we helped a number of others achieve
excellent positions elsewhere.

Next year, we move from 4.5 full-time-equivalent (FTE) faculty to 6 FTE
faculty [1].  No, it's not enough, but it is an improvement.  Colleges are
also slow-moving creatures; it is rare that a department can add more than
one FTE per year.  It's more complicated than normal at Grinnell because
the Trustees and the President have capped the number of tenure-line
positions.  That means that if we gain a tenure-line position, someone
else loses one.  So it is not easy for the Dean or for Executive Council.

What also makes it more complicated is that CS is not a typical
academic discipline.  In most disciplines, the number of available
Ph.D.'s interested in academic careers is much higher than the number
of positions.  That means it's easy to hire for term positions.  In CS,
the number of open tenure-line positions outstrips the number of qualified
applicants.  That means it's much harder to hire for term positions,
particularly if you are in the middle of Iowa.  But tenure-line positions
are significant commitments; you should normally think of a tenure-line
hire as a thirty-year position.  So even I would be reluctant to add
more than one tenure-line position, even though I think we need about
more faculty members in the department.

Writing to the Dean is unlikely to be helpful.  He does not make the
decisions on how to allocate tenure-line positions.  Our Executive Council
(faculty governing body) does.  He does not make decisions on how many
tenure-line positions we have.  The President and Trustees have put on
that cap.

As importantly, Dean Latham has been an incredibly strong supporter of
the CS department.  He helped bring in our Peer Education Coordinator.
He supported the expansion of Mr. Stone's position to full-time lecturer.
He increased our peer educator budget.  Complaining to him is unfair and
wastes his limited time.

Over the next year, the department will be exploring solutions.  I hope
that we get another tenure-line position [2].  I worry about what the
College loses if we do [3].  We will work with the Dean to get long-term
visiting positions (even though we are worried about our chance of filling
them) and to find spaces to house them.  We are building relationships
with other departments and initiatives on campus that can help.  We will
continue to be welcoming to a broad variety of students, to support them
in their learning and exploration of CS, and to make sure that they can
complete majors in the department.

So, if you'd like to help, don't complain to the Dean (or to Council or to
the Trustees).  Rather, find positive things to do:  Help us mentor our
students (many of you are doing so already).  Identify people who might
serve in term positions and encourage them to apply.  Find someone or
some organization to donate $2 mil for an endowed chair; we're a leader
in diversity, certainly Microsoft or Google or Amazon or Intel would want 
to help with that.

I appreciate your passion for your College and for our department.  Please
use that passion productively.

[1] Just to be clear: That increase involves a position approved by
Council in Spring 2016 to start in Fall 2017 and the expansion of
John Stone's position from three courses per year to five courses
per year.

[2] I have heard nothing yet.  My understanding is that Council has not
yet decided.

[3] While the College's official policy right now is "We don't have to
cut the  year we add", I do worry about the departments that have applied
for replacements for faculty who have left.  Even if those are not cut,
I worry about whatever department would be cut in the future.

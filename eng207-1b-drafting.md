Once I wrote [my first assignment for _The Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_](eng207-1b-assignment) I had to undertake the much more
complex task of drafting my manuscript.  I didn't expect my first
draft to be my last, and it wasn't [1].  However, I did want a
substantial first draft to work with.

I had to choose a subject for the piece, a place or some form of
travel.  I don't travel a lot, except to conferences or to see my
children.  So I decided to focus on place.  Prof. Savarese had
already told me that I could not use [Plans] as a place.  I ended
up settling on my office in Noyce.  I spend more time there than
almost anywhere.  It contains memories.  It contains objects.  Lots
of objects.  Even though I'm currently banished from it, it's a place
I know well.  I thought it would be fun to write about.

What about the point of the piece?  I thought I'd let that emerge
as I wrote.  It's something I do frequently.  You write to learn.
How do you know what your piece is about until you learn by writing
it?  The seven tasks I'd assignment myself?  I thought I'd either
find appropriate places along the way, or address them retrospectively.

I started by narrating the chaos that one encounters upon entering
the office.  That seemed to be the right way to explore my office.
It also let me play with how I describe objects and to mix the
length of the sentence fragments I used.  Perhaps because I'd just
read the Jamaica Kincaid, I ended up writing in the second person:
"The first thing you notice about the room is the sheer volume of
books."  I kept coming back to that first paragraph, adding things
you might see.

At some point, I realized that the natural "You" was a student.
I needed to give them a reason to visit my office.  And there it
was, an exam on my table.  I hadn't realized that the exam would
come to help structure the place.

I wanted to describe some of the objects in more detail; to give their
backstory.  I ended up with a few more paragraphs.  I knew that I'd
have to structure them a bit better; my initial goal was just to get
some of the descriptions down.

I realized that I'd fallen into "You" and "They" as the two main
characters.  Particularly since "You" can be difficult, I thought
about the pairs.  You can see a simulation of my thought process,
simplified.  I had considered writing multiple versions of the 
piece using different pairs of voices.  I ended up doing most of
that work in my head and settled on "You" and "I".  I liked the
"You"; I think it moves the piece forward.  But the "they" had
felt a bit impersonal.  Plus, most of the pieces we were reading
included the author explicitly.

Once I'd done that, I began to think about the "reversal of roles".
What better way to reverse roles than to have the student critique
the instructor?  I haven't strictly echoed Abbey, who was worried
about how others would assess or study him. Rather, I have the
student assessing me, or, more precisely, assessing my writing.
I realized that the choice was a bit "meta", but found that I liked
it.

It was, of course, a total joy to dredge up the wide variety of
criticisms I expected for my piece

I thought about the assignment to describe something without naming
it, and removed any use of the word "office" from my piece.  

---

1. Sneak in the lyrics to a popular song by breaking them up.

   > I ended up with "You and I, we've been through that." from Bob Dylan's
     "All Along the Watchtower", as performed by Jim Hendrix.

   > That didn't appear until the second draft.

2. Rule of three, using two identical short sentences and then expanding in the third.

   > "You ignore the voices.  You ignore the voices.  You ignore the
     voices, but they insist on ..."

   > I would have told you that I hadn't included that until the second
     draft, but I see it in my initial draft.  I probably edited along
     the way.

3. Write about something indirectly, without saying explicitly what it is.

   > I don't think I ever explicitly describe it as an office.

4. Reverse a trope or role.

   > The student edits my writing.

5. Use an adverb or a single word as a sentence by itself, suggesting multiple meanings.

   > I had originally included "Perhaps you knew that quote already.  Liberated.  "  I had intended the double meaning to refer back to the quote (when your chains are removed you are liberated) and the liberation you get from knowledge.

   > Once I started writing about the plants, the "naturally" came, well,
     naturally.  I originally had "It’s still on the window sill.  Naturally."
     I ended up with "Its corpse remains on the window sill.  Naturally."
     I like the corpse; it feels a bit more descriptive and it makes it
     clearer that it doesn't belong.  In retrospect, I'm less comfortable
     with the switch away from "still".  I had found it too 
     repetitive, but I wonder if I was mistaken.  "Its corpse is
     still on the window sill."  I'm not sure.

6. Violate the reader’s expectations of one of the characters.

   > Do you expect a computer scientist to talk so much about art?

7. Add an appropriate, but somewhat sarcastic, parenthetical comment about something unexpected you’ve just revealed about a character.

   > "I might pull one out from a stack (always organized)".  'nuff said.

You probably need to read the whole piece to understand the broader
context of each of those.

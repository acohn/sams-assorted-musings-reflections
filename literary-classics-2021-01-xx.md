The other day, part of our dinner discussion centered around the
[#DisruptTexts](https://disrupttexts.org) movement, which strives
to change the expected readings in K-12 classrooms from classics
like _The Scarlet Letter_ or _Moby Dick_ to modern young adult (YA)
literature.

The rhetoric of that movement is fairly strong.  For example, Ellen
Oh, founder of [#WeNeedDiverseBooks](https://diversebooks.org) [1],
a related movement, wrote [2]

> This year, we should do a WORST CLASSIC BOOKS EVER list and
  why they should not be taught in K-12 schools anymore because
  the legit cause kids to hate reading.

> Number one on the list:

> MOBY DICK - it literally kills brain cells [4]

Why do we want students to read fiction, which is really what this
is about?  Because we learn from fiction: We learn about the world,
about people different than us [5], about thought processes. Most
good literature gets us to understand that no one is perfectly good
nor perfectly evil; it helps us understand and embrace our "flaws"
and to look for he spark of positive in someone who seems irredeemable.
When we practice reading, we learn a love of reading (or some one
hopes).  We want students to read because reading introduces us to
new words, words that we can use to communicate more creatively and
which we can better interpret when others use.  We want students
to read because when we read we learn language different than that
which we speak, perhaps a common form of our supposedly common
language [6], perhaps different variants.  And learning to read and
speak differently can help build connections.  We want students
to learn to appreciate language: a well-crafted sentence or
paragraph, a clever description, a subtle metaphor, the way great
writers can carefully turn our perspective with words alone.

Why do we want students to read "the classics", whatever those may
be.  In part, it's because these classics provide a common frame
of reference.  Whether it's "To be or not to be", the cynicism of
Holden Caulfield [7], the dangerous obsessions of Ahab, the sufferings
of Job, the meaning of a scarlet letter [8], the unexpected friendship
of Huck and Jim and what it means, whenever someone uses these uses
these phrases or metaphors, we want our students (or our students
future selves) to understand them.  But it's more than that, at
least I think it is.  When studied carefully, many classics can
reveal the beauty and power of language.

My first reaction to hearing about the movements was negative.  We
shouldn't be telling people not to read things [9].  And, as I
noted, there are many benefits to reading classics.  However, the
more I thought about it, the more I realized that it's also likely
that most who benefit from reading classics already love reading
and have developed the skills or perspective that allows them to
adapt to different language, to look for and appreciate an interesting
turn of phrase, to see themselves and othere in what they read.

And that common knowledge?  It's about a particular group of people:
Mostly white, mostly Christian (Protestant, not Catholic).  If you
don't fall in that group, can you empathize with the characters?
I'd hope so.  After all, isn't that one of the points of literature?
I'm not British, but I empathize with British characters.  I'm not
Christian, but I learned from reading about Christian characters.
I'm not black, but I learned about the experiences of black people
through reading [10].  And, as an avid reader of science fiction and
fantasy, I even learned the perspective of people who aren't strictly
people.

But I come from a point of privilege, or at least comparative
privilege.  So while I did not read many (any?) stories about
culturally Jewish upper-middle class children, I could find something
to link myself to many of the characters.  And I'd developed an
early love of reading.  What if you haven't developed that love,
if you can't find anything to connect you to those you are reading
about?  And what if your experience is that the books you read try
to norm you to the White Protestant pespective?

So I can understand the emphasis on finding books in which students
can find themselves, and on finding books that help students learn 
more about their peers.  That mostly means modern fiction.

I don't accept the "people were worse then; we shouldn't read things
from a time when people were racist or ..."

Language of _The Canterbury Tales_ should be foreign to everyone;
it's a leveling.

[4] Sorry Ralph.

[5] In a recent conversation, one of my colleagues suggested that those who read more often have more empathy.

[6] Of course, [there are those who object to common language](https://cccc.ncte.org/cccc/demand-for-black-linguistic-justice).

[7] I must admit that I've never read _The Catcher in the Rye_.

[8] Or should I write Scarlet Letter, or perhaps even _Scarlet Letter_.

[9] Well, we might tell them not to read things because kids are defiant;
some will read them because we tell them not to.

[10] Admittedly, much of that reading was from biographies or autobiographies
rather than fiction.

Inbox zero, stage seven
=======================

You may remember that in [our last adventure](inbox-zero-06), I had made
the idiot decision to disconnect and reconnect my Grinnell account in
Mail.app, resulting in about 180,000 messages appearing in my inbox.
To make sure that things were working correctly, I did it again.  One
consequence of that action is that I could see exactly how many messages
Mail.app thought it should download.  It appears that I have 518,470 
messages in my Grinnell mailboxes.  Yay!  I beat half a million.

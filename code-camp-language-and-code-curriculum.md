Curriculum for the langugae and code camp
=========================================

*Topics/tags: [Code camps](index-code-camps), Racket, Digital Humanities*

In [a recent musing], I discussed the genesis of the "language and code"
camp and the planning and preparation that I need to do for the camp.  As
I suggested, my first step is to sketch the overall schedule.  There are
two parts to that.  I need to think about what the goals are for each
day and I need to think about how to break each day up into times.  I
can use the data science camp as a guide for breaking up each day, but
I'll probably make a bunch of changes based on both forced changes (e.g.,
we're doing lunches at different times, which also means that snack breaks
will change, content changes (e.g., we won't be teaching them micro:bits),
and my own personal preferences (e.g., I think that we should mostly do
the scavenger hunts immediately after lunch).

Let's start with a big picture overview [1].

*Monday*

The primary goal of Monday is to give the students an introduction to
what we will be doing for the week and to get them a bit excited.

We usually have a few hours of set-up on the first day.  We give surveys.
We orient the to the camp.  We have them log on to the computer.  

We also teach algorithms.  For the craft of code camp, we do my
traditional [PB&J Exercise](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1227440).
For the data science for social good camp, we use a variant of Mikey
Goldweber's "Boston Molasses Spill" exercise [2].  I'm not yet sure
what to use for this camp.  Instructions for writing a story?  I'll 
have to think about it.

We also have two snack breaks and one lunch break.  Day one is also
a good day to start the Noyce Scavenger Hunt [3].

That leaves us with about three one-hour activities.  Let's see ...

* The "[So you want to build a snowman](https://dustycloud.org/misc/digital-humanities/Snowman.html) activity is a nice start to DrRacket.
* I'll adapt my introduction ot CSS and HTML.
* We'll have students plan and write short hypertext stories.  That
  also gives them something to show off to each other.

Day one is done.

**Things for Sam to figure out**

It would be great to allow the students to run cgi scripts with
Racket.  I know that that's straightforward with [a Racket Web
server](https://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/index.html).  But can 
I do it with our own server?  I'm not sure.  And maybe I shouldn't
need to; the Racket Web server can run on individual machines.

[1] I will admit that I wrote the overview at the same time that I
planned the individual days.  While I started with the big picture, as
topics fit (or, more often, did not fit) on particular days, I changed
the big picture.

[2] I can't find a link to that.

[3] The Noyce Scavenger Hunt was an ad-libbed addition during the first
ever code camp.  We had planned an outside scavenger hunt.  But it rained.
So we put together a list of interseting things, like "Find four pictures
of women scientists" and "Find something that starts with the same letter
as your first name" and had counselors take pictures of the students in
their group in front of each goal.  It was one of the most successful parts
of camp, so we continue using it.

Registration for first-semester, first-year students
====================================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), academia*

At most institutions of higher education, registration for classes
is both a straightforward and complex task.  On the one hand, it should
be straightforward: Working with their advisors, students figure out
what classes are appropriate for them and indicate those preferences.
However, in many cases, class slots are limited, and that makes the
situation much more difficult.  How do you give students the opportunity
to explore broadly while also balancing different students' needs?

Long ago, back in the days when I was an undergraduate, UofC [1] had a
form of first-come, first-served system.  You met with your advisor.  They
entered your information into the system.  If there were slots available,
you got into the classes.  If not, you got onto the wait list.  So if
you wanted a popular course, like Bevington's Shakespeare, you needed
to get an early appointment with your advisor.  I recall that students
regularly camped out the night before appointments became available.

For as long as I've been at Grinnell, we've used a somewhat fairer
and undoubtedly more complex system.  We allow an arbitrarily large
number of students into each class during a "pre-registration" period.
Then we cut in some manner that seems fair.  We prioritize majors in
major classes.  We look at students who have been closed out of a course
in a previous semester.  After that, some faculty fill in the remaining
slots based on what they've heard from the students.  Others ask the
registrar to select students randomly.  It's not a perfect system. For
example, students with more social capital [2] may be better able to
advocate for slots in courses.  But it's much better than first-come,
first-served and other registration policies I've heard.

But that process doesn't work for first-year students.  Students 
need to discuss their courses with their faculty advisor before the 
register, which means that they can't register until they are on
campus in the fall [4].  There isn't time for the standard system.

At one time, we had students come to a giant registration event in Harris
Gym [6].  Students would rush to get to the table of the first course
they most wanted, then the next, then the next.  I remember watching
how quickly intro Philosophy filled [7].  But that system wasn't fair.
Not all students could line up early.  For example, athletes and students
with jobs were at a disadvantage.

So about a decade ago, the Registrar's office developed a new approach.
The basic principles were (and are) straightforward: We would place
students in three rounds.  Students are prioritized randomly in the
first round.  In the second round, students get the opposite priority
as the first round; those who were placed late in the first round are
placed early in the second round, and vice versa.  I'm not quite sure
what happens in the third round; I'm pretty sure that by that time,
all of the popular classes are filled.

How does each round work?  Students have made a priority list for
each round.  That is, in the first round, they list their first choice,
then their second choice, and then their third.   They do the same for
all three rounds.  And yes, they do it all at once.

We also have a "cleanup" session after the three rounds.  Students have
time to meet with their advisors.  Then there's a smaller Harris Gym
session [8] in which students can meet with departments to add classes
individually.

I'm not sure that it's the way I'd design a system.  When I advise
students, I find that our analysis creates more of a decision tree.
Suppose I have a student who is really interested in Biology but would
also like to explore studio art.  I expect that Studio Art usually closes
in the first round.  I probably also expect that Biology closes in the
first round.  They choose to prioritize Biology.  But we list Studio
Art second in the first round, because we know that they won't get
Studio Art if we wait until the second round.  So what we do we do in
round two?  If the get Biology in round two, they don't need a science
course in round two.  However, if the end up in Studio Art, we should
put Chemistry in round two because it will be gone by round three [9].

But I don't get to make the decisions.  I'm also not sure how we'd deal
with more complex decision trees efficiently.  So we have the system 
we have.  When we first started this registration system, I suggested
we computerize it.  The Registrar's office wasn't interested.  So there's
a cohort of folks who have to read through all the forms and enter them
in the system one by one by one.

How well does the system work?  My experience is that it works pretty
well.  Most students get a set of courses they want.  Not all students
get all the courses they most want.  But not all students *can* get all
the courses they want.  And, in the end, students should be exploring
topics broadly and, in most cases, it doesn't really matter whether you
take a course your first semester or your second semester.

Is it an ideal system?  No.  Can I envision a better one?  No, except to
use computers, rather than humans, to do the work.  Is it a relatively
fair system?  I think so.

What will the system look like in a decade?  I have absolutely no idea.

[1] That's the University of Chicago.

[2] Or with advisors with more social capital [3]

[3] Or experience with the system.

[4] I realize that some institutions have incoming students come to
campus during the summer for some form of orientation and that students
can meet with their advisors then.  However, most such institutions draw
primarily from the local region.  Because Grinnell draws students from
across the country and across the world [5], and because we admit a
large number of students with limited resources who likely could not
take a week away from their summer work, it would be inappropriate to
require students to come to campus in the summer.

[5] 20% international students!

[6] Yeah, I know it's not a gym.  It still looks like a high-school gym.

[7] It's not quite full this fall, but it's close.  Poor Johanna has
has two 20-person sections of intro and nearly twenty in her Arendt course.

[8] With much smaller lines.

[9] Yes, I really do think about these issues when helping students
put together their plan.

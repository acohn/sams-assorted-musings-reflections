As [I noted a few months ago](weekly-report-2019-09-08), when
Youngest went off to college in a land far, far away and Eldest
went off to graduate school in the opposite direction, I began a
habit of writing a weekly "week in review" to share with my family
and encouraged them to do the same.  I had thought that I would
post those as musings but, well, things didn't happen as planned.
That is, although I wrote weekly reports, I didn't post them.  But
perhaps it's time to start again.  Here's a slightly edited version
of this week's report, which I sent to my family yesterday.

Another week that flew by.

Water aerobics was good this week.  On Wednesday morning, there
were only two of us there, so we got to do a lot of work with motion,
doing exercises from deep end to shallow end and back again.  Jumping
jacks in the shallow end were bad for my ankles, but that's probably
to be expected.  Wednesday afternoon's session with Holly didn't
feel as intense as the prior week but it was nice exercising with
mom.  Thursday morning we had five people and I enjoyed it.  My
watch claims that I'm burning tons of calories.  I don't know whether
or not that's accurate.  My joints still aren't great and I have
to pay more attention to my diet.

Like mom, I was disappointed in _Jesus Christ, Superstar_.  I have
most of the album of the film memorized; it was on my regular
playlist when I was a kid.  It's probably where I learned about
christianity.  I even recall discussing it in junior high and
realizing that I knew more than some christians about this stuff
(e.g., that the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene were different
people).  Anyway, back to the show.  The set was kind of boring.
I'm not sure if they were trying to hearken back to the stage they
used in the early 1970's but it did not have the design flair I've
seen in most recent shows.  I thought the actor who played JC's
voice was mediocre at best.

Like mom, I enjoyed seeing Middle dive this weekend.  I liked seeing
him place first on the three-meter board.  I enjoyed seeing him
attempt some fairly hard dives; I think I counted three with
two-and-a-half flips (or, as I think of them, "N05 dives").  I was
sorry to see that Teammate didn't make his dive with three-and-a-half
flips.

Computers are causing difficulty in my life.  My laptop's keyboard
is dying; the "e" key works only intermittently.  The drive that
was dying toward the end of break is no longer recognized by my
computer and I don't have the energy to send it back.  They're
moving my Web site and it is not going smoothly.  There were other
things, too, but I can't remember them. Oh, even though I met with
ITS to get a new laptop about four months ago, there was a mixup
and it never got ordered.  But there's a positive result from that:
Apple no longer makes 15" laptops, so I'm getting one of the new
16" ones.  I hear they've fixed the problem with the keyboard, going
back to the old scissor switches from butterfly switches.  ITS even
acknowledged that I probably need 32GB of RAM.  Happy Dad!

I've been trying and failing to get reading done this week.  I was
hoping to finish _The Starless Sea_ before I chose a reading.  But
enough time had passed that it seemed best to just pick it and hope
for the best.  Mom thinks it's strange, but I really like the
imagery.  I never did get to read the new Seanan McGuire book.

Mom and I finished watching _Hellcats_ this week [1].  The show went
downhill as the season went on.  As mom said, "I can see why it
didn't get renewed."  I tried to get mom to watch _Sex Education_,
but she didn't find it as funny as I did.  We also watched another
episode of _Legacies_ (and yes, we'll re-watch if folks want to see
it as a family).  I'm not sure what's up next.

I'm still musing.  Today's was insanely long (5000+ words).  It was
just one of those days that I kept writing.  I probably need an
editor.  (Ooh!  I'll add that to this musing.)

I recall feeling really blah a day or two this week.  Maybe Friday
after Jon's meet?  I can't recall.  But I seem to be doing okay
now.

I'm looking forward to starting class next week.  I have Ralph's
_Craft of Creative Nonfiction_ on Tuesday and Justin's _Digital
Media Design_ on Wednesday.  I'm missing Ralph's class on Thursday.
Friday, I'm helping to run a Faculty/Staff Friday on Belonging.

Mom and I are supposed to go to a show with Friend on Thursday.
We're not sure we can make it.  I may go see Andrew Yang on Monday
night.  I may go to the Jazz Band Potato Bar on Friday night.

I feel like I'm missing one or two things.  I'll probably remember
immediately after I send this [2].  Oh well, that's how it goes.

Love you all! [3]

[1] Yeah, we watch some mediocre TV.

[2] Nope, I didn't.

[3] That message is for my family.  I love some of my readers, but I don't
even know all of you.

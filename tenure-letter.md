A letter to my newly-tenured colleagues
=======================================

*We recently had the annual announcement of faculty who were promoted
to associate professor, with tenure.  At least when I got tenure, tenure 
at Grinnell felt weird and somehow anticlimactic.  Hence, I've had a tradition
of sending a letter and a small gift to each newly-tenured colleague.
I'd given up the tradition for a number of years, but restarted it
last year.  I distributed letters and gifts to the folks I saw today.
(Not all of this year's newly-tenured faculty have them yet, so they
may first see the letter here, but that's how things go.)*

From: Samuel A. Rebelsky   
To: My newly-tenured colleague   
Re: Congratulations!

Dear Colleague,

I understand that the Personnel Committee has recommended that the
Trustees of Grinnell College promote you to the rank of Associate
Professor and award you tenure, that the Dean and the President have
accepted this recommendation, and that the Trustees have followed
these recommendations.  Congratulations!  Grinnell is improved by
your presence, and I am very happy to hear that you will continue
to be here to the benefit of your students, your colleagues, and the
broader College community.

Please accept the accompanying gift as part of your entry into
tenured status.  As you know, Associate Professors naturally take
on more committee responsiblities.  The gift is intended to provide
support for you in such activities (or at least to ease the burden of
such activities).

Because most Grinnell faculty who receive tenure clearly deserve tenure
and because tenure naturally confers additional work expectations,
those who receive tenure sometimes feel somehow empty, as if a big event
lacks the import it should.  (It used to be worse &mdash; these days
you get an extra raise, which provides some acknowledgement of your value.)
However, you will discover some additional benefits to your new status.
In my own case, the first real evidence I saw of the power of tenure
was when I got to react to what I deemed to be a silly rule (about the
particular shade of red one must use in presenting the Grinnell logo).
I said, *I don't care.  I have tenure.* I then went on to do what I
wanted.  In any case, I have found it an empowering and useful phrase,
and I encourage you to remember it and use it wisely.

Welcome to the ranks of the tenured.  I look forward to working with
you for years to come.  Congratulations again!

*p.s. Associate Dean Karla Erickson has created some support infrastructure 
for "mid-career" faculty.  I think you now fit in that category.  I'd
encourage you to use Karla's support.  I've certainly found it helpful.*

Conciseness vs. concision
=========================

*Topics/tags: [Language](index-language), short*

[Grammarly](https://www.grammaly.com) has a variety of categories
of suggestions it makes, including spelling, grammar, punctuation,
conventions, formality, confidence, clarity, variety, vocabulary, and
conciseness.  Why does Grammarly use "conciseness" when "concision" is,
well, more concise?  Maybe it's just me, but "concision" also sounds
better.  "Brevity" would also be a reasonable alternative; after all,
we've been told that it is the soul of wit.

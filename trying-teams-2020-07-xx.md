Wanted to use Slack.

Told to use Teams.

But it's growing on me.

Problem: I rely on my email as a repository of information.  So how
do I make Teams easier to browse and search.

No regular expressions.  Damn.

Started boldfacing the subject of threads.  I think that will help.
We shall see.

How do I find thread titles?  I started writing "Subject: **Title**".
But I couldn't get Teams to search for "Subject:".

Learned that there's a hidden Subject field.  Now I'm using that.  But
I don't think I can search it.  Yay for badly designed sotware.

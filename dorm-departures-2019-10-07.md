Dorm departures
===============

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), [Grinnell](index-grinnell)*

One of the disadvantages of being on sabbatical is that I am less
aware of what is happening on campus [1].  I don't always get the
_Scarlet and Black_ and I don't hear as much from students and
colleagues because I don't see nearly as many students or colleagues.
But occasionally one of them sends me something of interest.
Recently, one pointed me to [an article in the
_S&B_](https://grinnell.formstack.com/forms/shuttle_signup).  My
colleague and the article pointed out a new addition to the
_Student Handbook_.

> Non-graduates are required to check-out within 24 hours of their last final exam; Graduates are required to checkout by noon the day after Commencement. [2]

I understand why folks in the administration thought things needed
to change; as the _S&B_ article suggests, some students who finished
their work early in the spring were less than responsible during
the time after they finished and their escapades added burdens to
Student Affairs and interfered with the ability of their dorm-mates
to do their work [4].  Traditionally, issues like this are handled
by techniques of Self Governance and, if necessary, by JudCo [5].
But the administration seems to have gone with a new policy instead.

I had written up a host of concerns I had about the policy and the
way it was implemented.  But you know what?  Our Dean of Students
says that the primary goal was student wellness.  So, while I may
have concerns, I don't think it's appropriate for me to air them
in public.  

What's happened to me?

p.s. I am heartened by the suggestion in the article that students
can apply for an exception so that they can, for example, stay on
campus to pick up a few extra dining shifts or stay until [the
airport shuttles on
Friday/Saturday](https://grinnell.formstack.com/forms/shuttle_signup).  I
hope that the process for applying for an extension is easy.

[1] Maybe that's an advantage of being on sabbatical.

[3] At least it's currently available at the URL.  I'm not sure what happens
to old student handbooks on that server.

[4] I know none of this for a fact.  I am interpreting from what I read
in the article.

Phishing scams
==============

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc)*

Recently, I've started to receive messages that appear to come from my
own account and say things like,

> I've hacked your account and I've been watching you.  Send me Bitcoins
or I'll share screenshots of what you've been doing. [1]

I wasn't very worried.  The sequence of characters they claim
was my password wasn't.  More importantly, there's not much that
appears on my screen that I wouldn't want others to see [2] and
certainly not the kinds of things they suggest [3].  I reported
the first few messages to ITS and left it at that.  Then I saw
that [UCF had enough instances that it has warned its employees about the
scam](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/10/26/central-florida-warns-employees-%E2%80%98sextortion%E2%80%99-scam).

We also got a very different version of the message posted to the mailing
list.  You can certainly tell it's a scam when a non-person receives it.
It's also less sophisticated than the other one; it makes no claim about
a password and it does not appear to come from the mailing list account.
Since the UCF post shows one version of the scam, I thought I'd share
another one for your edification or amusement.

And so now i know who my goal is to deliver that to, in case you not necessarily going to settle this along with me.

I'm not going to move through every detail and stuff, just ain't got precious time for that and also you likely know that world-wide-web is overloaded with text letters like this, so it's as well your decision to believe in this or not, there may be only a proven way to uncover.

The socio-technologist in me finds this scam interesting.  It's relatively
easy to harvest email addresses [4].  It's cheap to send out large numbers
of email messages.  Evidence suggests that lots of people visit porn
sites [5].  Our society has such strong strains of both Puritanism [6]
and progressivism [7] that those people would want to keep their use hidden
from others, not only for fear of embarassment, but for fear of job loss.
So, even if there's only a small success rate, there's money to be made.

I wonder how well it works? [8]  I also wonder what happens to those who
pay [9].

[1] That's a paraphrase  

[2] Please don't take that as a challenge.

[3] Some people call this a "sextortion scam".  

[4] I'm pretty sure there are even sites at which you can find or
purchase large sets of email addresses with accompanying information.
The list from the Ashley Madison data breach would be a good starting
point.

[5] Or perhaps a very small number of people each visit porn sites an
incredibly large number of times.

[6] Sex is a private act that should never be discussed in public.
(I am just reporting the perspective.  I do not agree with it.)

[7] Most kinds of pornography objectify and denigrate women.  (In this
case, I generally agree.)

[8] I am not tempted to try the scam myself.  But the scholar in me wants
to know more about the "results", as it were, and what it says about the
modern world.

[9] Do their names get added to a list of easy targets?

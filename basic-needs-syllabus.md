Adding a basic needs statement to the course syllabus
=====================================================

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching)*

Some time this semester, an alum suggested I read [an
article by Sara Goldrick-Rab entitled "Basic needs security and the
Syllabus"](https://medium.com/@saragoldrickrab/basic-needs-security-and-the-syllabus-d24cc7afe8c9)
[1].  For those who haven't read the article, Goldrick-Rab observes
that because there are students who face food and housing insecurity
and that such insecurity likely affects their performance, we should
acknowledge the issues in the syllabus and suggest avenues of support.
Goldrick-Rab provided the statement she uses for her graduate class.

> Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing and believes this may affect their performance in the course is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. Furthermore, please notify the professor if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable her to provide any resources that she may possess.

She also provides one aimed at undergraduates.

> Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact the Dean of Students for support. Furthermore, please notify the professor if you are comfortable in doing so. This will enable her to provide any resources that she may possess.

There are students on Grinnell's campus who face food insecurity.
We have a food pantry in the CRSSJ [2] to help address that need.  I know
less about housing insecurity on campus, although I do know some students
who don't have a "home" to go home to outside of Grinnell.

It seems important for me to follow Goldrick-Rab's lead.  I had initially
considered adapting the latter statement as is, with a few slight changes.
However, I realized that I wanted it in my own words.  Unfortunately, this
policy falls into the intersection of the categories of "things Sam wants
to express in his own words" and "things Sam has difficulty writing well".
Perhaps I'll get there by reflecting on what Goldrick-Rab provides.

Do we need the "believes this may affect their performance"?
How can food or housing insecurity *not* affect their performance?
I suppose that the extra language falls in the category of giving students
ownership of their choice of whether, when, and how to get support.
But I tend to be more directive.  For example, I recall that I'm more
directive in my accommodations text.  I know that disabilities and basic
needs security are very different issues, but the statements should share
my intention of encouraging students to connect with the resources that
they need.

Let me see.  It appears that I have two sets of accommodations text,
a short common text that we seem to use in all sections of CSC 151 and
a longer text that better expresses my personal practice.  I also have
a separate statement on my attempts to make the course web accessible,
but that's not relevant here.  In any case, the short statement reads

> My goal is to help you learn as much as possible in this course; please let me know what I can do meet your learning needs. If you have a disability that requires accommodations, please contact Disability Services. Disability Services will work with you to determine your needs, and will provide you with paperwork outlining the accommodations you require. Please give me this paperwork at least a week before the course activity for which you need accommodations. If this timeline is not feasible for any reason, please contact me as soon as possible and we will work together to find a solution.

The longer statement reads as follows.

> I encourage those of you with disabilities, particularly hidden disabilities such as learning disabilities, to come see me about the accommodations and adjustments that I can make to make your learning easier. When making such accommodations and adjustments, I prefer to work with students who have documented disabilities, since such documentation regularly includes not only recommendations for particular accommodations, but also general principles to help me develop other appropriate accommodations and adjustments.

> If you have not already done so, you should also discuss your disability with Disability Services. If you think you may have an undocumented learning disability, please speak to me and to Disability Services. However, I will work with you whether or not you have documented the disability. (I believe I am only allowed to use the term “accommodation” for cases in which students have documented disabilities. Other students will find that I make appropriate “adjustments”.)

> In my experience, some learning difficulties can make learning computer-related topics more difficult, particularly because computers emphasize small details. I also know that many of my favorite and best students have some learning disability and have succeeded. In fact, many have excelled. We’ll all do better if you talk to me about disabilities early. I will make accommodations and adjustments that seem to be appropriate.

> Note that I generally find that the accommodations and adjustments that I make for those with learning disabilities are appropriate for all students, so I often incorporate them as part of the normal structure of my courses.

What do these say about my approach [3]? The short statement begins with
a rationale of supporting students.  I like that.  The short one does
suggest that it's only necessary to visit Disability Services if the
student needs accommodations.  But I believe that there are benefits to
visiting with our experts in any case, which is why the longer statement
includes "If you have not already done so, you should also discuss your
disability with disability services."  

What else worries me about the version I thought of copying?  I tend
to avoid passive ("is urged") and don't like people to refer to me in
the generic ("the professor").  I'm not sure about "providing resources
that [I] may possess".  While I have been known to share my financial
resources, I see my role as more helping the student navigate College
and town resources than providing my own.

So, while I like the sentiment of the original, it does not represent me.
Now that I've reflected on the important points, let's see what I can
come up with.

> Other factors may also affect your ability to thrive in this class.
In particular, students who have difficulty affording groceries or
accessing sufficient food to each every day or who lack a safe and
stable place to live may find that their situation affects their
performance.  I encourage such students to contact the  [Dean of
Students](https://www.grinnell.edu/profiles/student-affairs/staff) or
the [CRSSJ](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/crssj)
for support.  You may also notify me, if you feel comfortable doing so,
and I will do my best to help you identify and arrange other resources.
We can also discuss other ways I can support you.

I'll need to let that gel a bit before committing to it.  I should also
chat with folks in Student Affairs and the CRSSJ to determine who they'd 
like me to put as the contacts in the paragraph [4].

The next question is where to put the statement in the syllabus.  The
"[o]ther factors" suggests that I've planned it to follow the section
on accommodations and adjustments.  I tend to title the sections of my
syllabus.  What title should I use?  For now, I think "Basic needs
security" will have to suffice.  Again, that's something I'll need to
let gel for a bit.  Fortunately, I have a month or so until classes 
start [5].

I wonder what mom would have suggested?

Postscript: The latest [Campus Memo](https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Campus-Memo---12-18-2018.html?soid=1101855135914&aid=7Q4bQo9WqCg) arrived while I was composing this musing.  It begins with the following.

> **Donations for Student Pantry **

> The Student Pantry, located in the Center for Religion, Spirituality, and Social Justice, 913 8th Ave., will offer food, toiletries, and cold weather gear to students who may need assistance over winter break.  As you may know, many international students remain in Grinnell over the winter break when the dining hall is not open. Additionally, domestic students from non-contiguous states in the U.S. and those who cannot afford to travel or for personal reasons cannot go to a home, spend many weeks finding ways to purchase and prepare food. In recent years, there has been an increase in expressed need for food assistance from our low-income students over the break and throughout the year.

> In an effort to aid these students in their need over the break, the Chaplain's Office will open the pantry beginning on Saturday, Dec. 22. They are accepting donations of (mostly) non-perishable food and other items at the CRSSJ through Thursday, Dec. 20 and again beginning on Jan. 3, 2019.  As they are able and eligible, the CRSSJ will assist students in finding other local sources for food, toiletries, and clothing. As you might imagine, these needs do not begin and end with academic breaks. Many low-income students are food insecure throughout the year. The CRSSJ plans  to have some supplies in the pantry throughout the spring semester as well.

> The CRSSJ is asking for donations for the pantry. The CRSSJ is open and staffed, Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-5 p.m. It welcomes your assistance and your opinions as it begins this endeavor. Over the next week or so, the hours for the pantry will be finalized.  Check out the list of [suggested items for donation](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/offices/Communications/Shared%20Documents/Sarah%20GA%20-%20do%20not%20publish/Pantry%20List%20for%2012-19.pdf?utm_source=Campus+Memo++-+12.18.18&utm_campaign=Campus+Memo+12-18-18&utm_medium=email) [6].

Some shorter questions and answers about Grinnell's CS program
==============================================================

*Recently, our Office of Admissions forwarded along a student's questions
about our program.  These are their questions and my answers.  I expect
that I will add additional questions and answers as they arrive.  See
the end of the page for a note on when the page was last updated.*

Are Grinnell's computer science classes more theoretical or practical? 

> Our classes have a mix of theory and practice.  We firmly believe that
understanding the underlying theory helps you adapt better as technologies
change, and we hear the same from our alums.  At the same time, most of
our students best understand concepts when they build things.  So we
incorporate both theory and practice in most classes.  Some, like CSC
301 (Algorithm Analysis) and CSC 341 (Automata, Formal Language, and
Computational Complexity) skew more toward the theoretical.  Others,
like CSC 321 (Software Design Principles and Practices) and CSC 322
(Team-Based Software Development for Community Organizations) skew more
toward the practical.

How accessible are the professors? 

> My sense is that our faculty are very accessible, and I hear the same
from our students, including in their graduation interviews, when they
are most willing to praise and criticize.  Most of us keep our doors open
when we are in the office and are happy to talk with students about a wide variety of issues: our courses, broader ideas in CS, curricular planning, life after Grinnell, other issues of common interest, and so on and so forth.  

Are there research opportunities available?

> Certainly.  We had about two dozen students working with faculty on
research projects this past summer.  But more of our students go off
to internships.  More information on our research opportunities are
available on [a separate page](research-in-cs-2016).

Can you tell me the graduate school placement or the jobs the Computer
Science graduates have held?

> I will admit that I don't know our placement rate for either jobs or
graduate school.  Students who want to go to graduate school get in, and
get funded, but I don't know that they always get their first choice.
Students who make a serious effort at getting jobs usually get jobs,
but a few have trouble. As of December 2016, I think half of the senior
class has already accepted offers (Microsoft, Expedia, Amazon, Google or
Nest, some consulting firms, a few boutique software firms, and others
I forget).  Epic is one of the most popular employers.

Do recruiters often visit Grinnell College and have the students held
internships at well-known places like Google, Microsoft,etc?

> We do not get many recruiters visiting Grinnell; we are small, and
far from most firms.  Nonetheless, our students have been able to obtain
internships at well-known places.  I think we send about two to Google
each summer, about two to Microsoft, about two to Amazon, and about
two to Goldman Sachs. There seems to be a pretty good pipeline to
these places.  Microsoft, in particular, always asks their interns
to suggest other Grinnell students, and I think Google and Amazon do
something similar.  The rest of our students go to a variety of other
places or to research experiences.

What other information can you provide?

> I've written [a variety of short pieces](index-prospective-students)
on computer science at Grinnell and on Grinnell in general.  The
[department Web site](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu) also has some useful
information, including a description of our curriculum.  I'd recommend
that you take a look at those.  If you still have questions, feel free
to email me at <rebelsky@grinnell.edu>.

"Advisor" wins!
===============

*Topics/tags: [Language](index-language), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), short*

When I arrived at Grinnell, the Office of Communications provided
what I call "The Grinnell Style Guide". That may have even been its
name. The guide was a small pamphlet that described writing customs to
use when writing about the College. For example, it indicated that we use
"first year" [1] rather than "freshman" [2] that we use "second year"
[4] rather than "sophomore", that we use an apostrophe and the last two
digits of a graduation year when referring to an alum, but only for the
first century after they graduate, and so on and so forth.

Among the many things in the style guide is a policy for how we spell
"advisor", or, as the guide specified, "adviser". If I recall correctly,
it read something like "the word adviser is always spelled with an
‘e’."  But I like the look of the "o" spelling. And I like its
support for multiple pronunciations. So I tend to use that spelling,
even though it violates the style guide [5].

Over the years, I’ve noted that many of the software products we
purchase use the same spelling I do [6]. I assume that the College has
no control over such matters. Nonetheless, I take such instances as a
modicum of support for my perspective.

Yesterday, the College released a memo that included the sentence
"Faculty also serve as *advisors*, both formally and informally, to
Grinnell students." [7,8]

Since the Campus Memo comes from Communications, I’ll take this
as evidence that my spelling won!  No longer need I worry that I’m
violating policy! [9]

[1] or "first-year student"

[2] I sometimes use freshling [3]. 

[3] my autocorrect thinks "freshling" should be "fresh lung".

[4] or "second-year student

[5] You may recall that one of my first post-tenure statements was in
response to Communications telling me that I could not print my own
letterhead because the shade of red would not be quite correct.  My
response?  "I don’t care. I have tenure."

[6] One example is Ellucian Self Service, aka "Academic Planning".

[7] Emphasis mine.

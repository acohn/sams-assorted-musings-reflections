Grinnellians you should know (or know about): J. Harley McIlrath
================================================================

*Part of an ongoing series about people associated with Grinnell College.*

I'd like to introduce you to my friend and former colleague, Harley
McIlrath.  For the past fifteen or so years, Harley has been the
primary "book person" in the Grinnell College bookstores.  Among
other things, he's the person who orders our texts and trade books
and, more generally, thinks about the role of books in the book
store.  In many ways, he's the first person faculty think about
when they think about the bookstore.

Harley came to a Grinnell through a fairly circuitous route.  He
grew up in the town and started college here.  But his interests
drew him elsewhere (University of Northern Iowa, I believe).  At
some point, he opened a used book store.  But family drew him back
to Grinnell, and as he returned, he joined the College bookstore.

Harley was (and is) a real bookseller.  If you've met a real
bookseller, you'll know what I mean when I say that Harley graciously
shared his knowledge of books with the College.  That is, he knew
a lot about books: He was not only well read in many areas, but
knew issues about publishing, about the book trade, and more.  He
is also a talented author, with at least one book of short, literary,
nonfiction under his belt.  His knowledge and skills meant that he
was someone many faculty could talk to about planning for their
courses.  Harley knew and cared enough Grinnell that one could
always learn something new about the history of the College from
him, whether it be anecdotes about Peter Coyote '64 or stories about
the legendary Bruce Springsteen concert.

I've had many pleasurable conversations with Harley through the
years, about books, about music (he's one of the only people I know
who not only has heard of, but even likes, Scruffy the Cat), about
life in general.  And Harley had many great stories to go with our
conversations: stories about meeting authors and musicians, stories
about the history of Grinnell, stories about many different people.

In addition to the many pleasurable conversations, I've always
enjoyed Harley's enthusiasm for our alumni and faculty authors.  He
was careful to make sure that we stocked books by alums (particularly
at reunion time) and, for a time, even worked to gather a variety
of historical texts related to the College.  I know that visiting
authors like chatting with him, and I'm still sad that I didn't get
to sit in on his conversation with Coyote and Terry Bisson '64.

Beyond work, Harley is father to two awesome kids.  His Facebook
page has a great picture of the three of them playing guitar together,
which I think says something about both Harley and his family.
(Sorry, that's all I'll say about his kids.  I generally don't
consider it appropriate to write about people's families.)

Harley is clearly a true Grinnellian.  Unfortunately, Harley is also a
victim of what I call "the beancounters", so you can no longer find him
in the bookstore.  But you can still find him around Grinnell.  If you
meet him, ask him about Peter Coyote, or Scruffy the Cat, or about books,
or about Iowa, or about his current novel.  You'll learn a lot, and have
a great conversation.

Distrust
========

*We recently had our monthly meeting of department chairs with representatives
from the Dean's office.  At that meeting, we discussed the new "Research
for All" requirements.  In our discussions, I was struck by what seemed to
be a deep distrust of the administration.  This essay is my attempt to analyze
the roots of that distrust.*

It strikes me that there are a number of factors that have led the faculty
to be distrustful of the administration.

1. Certainly, some *recent breakdowns in shared governance* contribute.
In that, I include primarily the wide variety of issues surrounding
the discontinuance of Posse, including not just how that was handled,
but also how it was discussed by the administration in faculty meetings
and how the followup actions were taken.

2. For some of us, the [*long-standing issues with the Web
site*](grinnells-web-presence.html) play a role.  It's hard not to feel
a bit adversarial after three-plus years of failure by the administration
to address the issues it created in moving to the new Web site.

3. Many faculty feel significantly increased stress from *additional
requirements* placed on them, requirements in which they feel they
have no voice.  Our regular campus adoption of software that makes
faculty lives more difficult, rather than easier, contributes to the
stress of these requirements.  I think, in particular, of Sedona and
WebAdvisor/Selfservice.  Given what I've heard, the new student success
software will feel like yet another obstacle to our work; instead of
making things easy, it imposes a multi-step workflow.

4. At the Chairs' meeting, I heard a number of concerns about *lack of
feedback from the Dean's office* - we are asked to submit documents and
hear nothing back about them.  The concerns raised were about research
plans, but I have the same concern about my budget.  I work carefully to
explain why I need the resources I've asked for.  All I get in response is
"This is what you get."  No acknowledgement for our rationale is given;
no explanation of why we don't get the resources we think we need.

5. It feels like faculty encounter an increasing number of decisions
that are made, but never conveyed to us in a way that lets us plan for
the implication.  The first things that come to mind are the recent
policy changes in Catering (which had huge budgetary implications for
departments), the Dean's office's decision not to cover all meals with
candidates, the creation of faculty Fridays without time or support for to
adapt to the impact those meetings have on departments that traditionally
use Fridays for meetings, and the recent change in policy on crediting
of music ensembles.

6. I also think the ongoing saga of SHACS contributes to the sense of
mistrust.  We regularly deal with our students' mental health issues
and know that SHACS has been broken for a number of years.  Each year,
the administration says "Don't worry, we've fixed it."  And then it turns
out we continue to have significant problems.  It becomes hard to have
a sense of shared mission and trust.

7. Then there's the broader issue that faculty everywhere are generally scared
of change, and we're seeing a lot of it.  Many changes are good, but
they still make us uncomfortable.

8. Grinnell's resources are an issue.  I used to say that one of the big
problems with having an endowment is that many of us don't understand
why, with all of our resources, we can't fund whatever their pet project
is. And I think we still have trouble adapting to that.  These days,
many faculty have difficulty reconciling a zero-sum game on tenure-line
faculty with what appears to be significant growth in both administrative
positions and highly-paid consultants.  The new Admissions building
probably contributes, too.  The College spent a lot on the Chrystal
Center.  It's not comforting to hear "We made a mistake, so we're going
to build another admissions building."  It's even less comforting to
hear that the current plans don't include a presentation space that the
admissions consultants say we clearly need.  And it's worrisome that
there doesn't seem to be much public discussion of that space.

As usual, I've gone on too long.  I hope that someone finds these
comments of some use.  As to how to address these issues, I'm not sure.
I think acknowledging what seem to be causes would be a good first step,
as would suggesting forward directions.

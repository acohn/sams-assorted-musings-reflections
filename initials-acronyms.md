CS department initials, acronyms, and abbreviations
===================================================

*Topics/Tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), silly, short*

The other day, I was writing a note and using the initials of some of
my colleagues.  As I did so, I realized that many of us have initials
that have everyday other meanings.  Here are the ones that immediately
came to mind.

* CC: Carbon copy.  Or perhaps Creative Commons.
* HW: Homework.
* AV: Audio/Visual.
* SR: Senior.
* PM: Personal message.  Also evening.
* PO: Upset.
* JS: JavaScript.

What about JW?  Nothing immediately came to mind.  But the InterWeb tells
me that it could be "Jehovah's Witness" or "Just Wondering" [1].

In our family, we have a Senior and a Mister and a Junior and a Doctor [3].
The last of us?  They seem to be a Wide Receiver [4].

How common is it that initials [5] serve as acronyms or abbreviations?  
I have no idea.

[1] I suppose if I was hip to the text message lingo, I would have known
that [2].

[2] I expect that "hip", "text message", and "lingo" are all dated terms,
which probably proves my point.

[3] SR, MR, JR, DR.

[4] WR.

[5] Or perhaps any pair of letters.

FedEx signatures
================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

Once in a while, when we order something or have it repaired, the sender
uses FedEx to ship the package.  That's not a problem; our local FedEx
driver is pretty good.  But some shippers require a signature.  *That* is
a problem.  Like most services, FedEx won't tell you when they plan
to visit.  I work for a living.  So does the rest of my family.  How
are we expected to be home to sign?

Sometimes you are able to go online and choose another option.  Let's see
what options are available. 

*Leave at a local FedEx facility.*  In Iowa, "local" is in the eye of
the beholder.  I think our local facility is in Des Moines, about sixty
miles away.  I'm not interested in driving two hours for something that's
been shipped to me.

*Choose the arrival date.*  That could be convenient.  For example,
we had signature required for four different shipments from the same
shipper, scheduled to arrive on three different days.  However, it's
not always possible to find *any* day to be at home.  For example,
those shipments were scheduled during a week that I was at code camp.

*Choose a new delivery address.*  That sounds good; I can have things
delivered to work and people; there are always people available to sign
[1]. But they charge extra if you change the address.  Something in me
rebels against paying extra for something that I've already paid for [2].

And that's it for the options [4].

I've tried leaving a signed note at the door.  The driver isn't allowed
to accept that.  I've tried leaving a note that says "Call me; I can be
there in five minutes".  That sometimes works; our driver can be very
accommodating.  But most of the time, I end up struggling to find an
appropriate solution.

What do *you* do?

Postscript: While I don't appreciate having to sign for FedEx packages,
I do appreciate the careful work with typefaces that went into the FedEx
logo to create the arrow.

[1] Or at least there are usually people available to sign during regular
FedEx hours.

[2] If I were more sensible, I'd just ship everything to my office [3].

[3] Of course, I also encounter vendors who are not willing to ship to
an address other than the one on my credit card.

[4] At least that's it for the options that I can recall.

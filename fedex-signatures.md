FedEx signatures
================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

Once in a while, when we order something or have it repaired, the sender
uses FedEx to ship the package.  That's not a problem; our local FedEx
driver is pretty good.  But some shippers require a signature.  That is
a problem.  FedEx won't tell you when they plan to visit.  I work for a
living.  So does the rest of my family.  So how are we expected to be home
to sign?

What are our options.

"Leave a local FedEx facility."  In Iowa, "local" is in the eye of the
beholder.  I think our local facility is in Des Moines, about sixty miles
away.  I'm not interested in driving two hours for something that's been
shipped to me.

"Choose the arrival date."  
That could be convenient.
For example, we had signature required for four different shipments from
the same shipper, scheduled to arrive on three different days.  
However, it's not always possible to find *any* day to be at home.  For
example, those shpments were scheduled during a week that I was at code camp.

"Choose a new delibery address."  That sounds good; I can have things
delivered to work and people ...  But they charge exra.  Something in
me rebels against paying extra.

What do you *you* do?

Toward the end of this year, I received a notice from Grinnell that
some people had donated to Grinnell in my name [1].  A bit later,
I was reading through the [_2018-19 Honor Roll of
Giving_](https://alumni.grinnell.edu/giving-to-grinnell/impact-2019-honor-roll)
[2] and noticed the section on Honoraria [3].  The donations were
repeated in that section, as were the many other gifts that people
gave in honor of someone or something.  It was good to see so many
of my students, alums, friends, and colleagues honored.

Then I realized that when I donate to Grinnell, I could have an
extra impact by choosing someone to honor with the donation.  The
additional impact is small; the primary effect is it makes someone
feel good.  However, I consider that worthwhile.  I know from my
experience that it feels good to see that someone took the time to
designate you as an honoree.

You might suggest that such gifts shouldn't make a difference, given
that we were going to donate to the College in any case.  However,
you can try to choose parts of the College that the folks you are
honoring would appreciate [7].  I will admit that it felt nice to
think of folks and say to myself [8], "We appreciate this person;
where would they like money to go in their honor?"

I must note that our choices of who to honor were somewhat ad hoc;
there are hundreds of people worth honoring at Grinnell; I mostly
went with the first ones who came to mind.  I wish we'd been able
to do more than the half-dozen or so we chose.

If you give to Grinnell, and I hope you do, I encourage you to consider
using the "in honor of" field when you donate.  It's a fun way to add
a bit extra to your donation.

[1] **Thank you** to those who have done so.  Thank you, also, to those
who show me honor and respect in other ways, most frequently through your
actions.

[2] No, I don't know why we password protect the honor roll.  You can try
asking the folks in Development and Alumni Relations for the password.
We used to have printed copies, which seems pretty public.

[3] Here's the preface to that section.

> Each year, Grinnell receives gifts that are made specifically in
honor of meaningful Grinnell memories of living Grinnellians [4],
including alumni, students, faculty and staff [5].  Between July
1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, the following individuals and organizations
were honored through gifts and pledges to Grinnell.  Please note
the list is in alphabetical order by last name of the honoree [6].

[4] There is a separate section for memorials.

[5] I don't know why there is no Oxford comma.

[6] Or by the name of the organization.

[7] Do folks we honor get notified of anything other than that there was
a donation in their name?  I'm not sure.  Do the departments to which the
donations go get notified?  I'm also not sure of that, either.  You think
that I would know since there have been donations in my honor and I've
been a department chair.  However, these kinds of issues don't seem to 
stick in my brain.

[8] Or "say to ourselves".

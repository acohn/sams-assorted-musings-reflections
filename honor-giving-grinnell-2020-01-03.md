This year, a confluence of events led me to some fun experiments
with donations to Grinnell.  First, my in-laws and my family decided
that we didn't need gifts and agreed that we'd give to a charity
in each others' names instead [1].  Second, I received a notice
from Grinnell that some people had donated to Grinnell in my name
[2].  Third, I was reading through the [_2018-19 Honor Roll of
Giving_](https://alumni.grinnell.edu/giving-to-grinnell/impact-2019-honor-roll)
[3] and noticed the section on Honoraria [4]. Finally, Michelle and
I were planning our annual gifts to Grinnell and other charities.

As you might guess, I realized that when I donated to Grinnell, I
could have an extra impact by choosing someone to honor with the
donation.  The additional impact is small; the primary effect is
it makes someone feel good.  However, I consider that worthwhile.
I know from my experience that it feels good to see that someone
took the time to designate you as an honoree.

You might suggest that such gifts shouldn't make a difference, given
that we were going to donate to the College in any case.  But we
tried to choose parts of the College those folks would appreciate
[8].  I will admit that the choices of who to honor were somewhat
ad hoc; there are literally hundreds of people worth honoring at
Grinnell and I simply went with the first ones who came to mind.
Some were also associated with particular gifts we had already
planned [9], such as to the Swimming and Diving Team, which always
needs support to bring students on their winter-break training trip,
and to Grinnell Singers, to help support the students who will be
traveling abroad this spring.

I will admit that it felt nice to think of folks and say to myself
[10], "We appreciate this person; where would they like money
to go in their honor?"

In retrospect, I missed a large swath of people we'd like to honor;
as I suggested, there are hundreds.  I wish we'd been able to do
more than the half-dozen or so we chose [11].  If I were more cynical,
I'd do something like give one dollar for each of them.  However,
even though the recipient does not know the amount we give, it feels
wrong if we don't give a reasonable amount in their name.  But I'll
try to continue the practice over the next few years and, over time,
I hope that I'll manage to honor a substantial fraction [12].

If you give to Grinnell, and I hope you do, I encourage you to consider
using the "in honor of" field when you donate.  It's a fun way to add
a bit extra to your donation.

Postscript: In preparing to write this musing, I revisited the
_Honor Roll of Giving_ and realized that the donors' names also
appear.  I guess that will make it clear who Michelle and I honored
this year.  If you don't see your name, please do not think that
we honor you any less than those whose names appear.  Rather, the
folks we honored were either associated with something to which we
wished to contribute or happened to be on our minds on the day we
donated.

Postscript: Here are some parts of the Honoraria section that I appreciate,
beyond the wide range of faculty, staff, alumni, and students who are 
honored.  One alumnus gave in honor of Chelsea Manning, Bernie Sanders,
and Edward Snowden.  A variety used the "in honor of" field to speak to
union issues on campus: Three in honor of the Grinnell Union of Student Dining
Workers, one in honor of students fighting for better working conditions,
one in honor of Union students [14]

[1] No the charity was not Grinnell.

[2] **Thank you** to those who have done so.  Thank you, also, to those
who show me honor and respect in other ways, most frequently through your
actions.

[3] No, I don't know why we password protect the honor roll.  You can try
asking the folks in Development and Alumni Relations for the password.
We used to have printed copies, which seems pretty public.

[4] Here's the preface to that section.

> Each year, Grinnell receives gifts that are made specifically in
honor of meaningful Grinnell memories of living Grinnellians [5],
including alumni, students, faculty and staff [6].  Between July
1, 2018, and June 30, 2019, the following individuals and organizations
were honored through gifts and pledges to Grinnell.  Please note
the list is in alphabetical order by last name of the honoree [7].

[5] There is a separate section for memorials.

[6] I don't know why there is no Oxford comma.

[7] Or by the name of the organization.

[8] Do folks we honor get notified of anything other than that there was
a donation in their name?  I'm not sure.  Do the departments to which the
donations go get notified?  I'm also not sure of that, either.  You think
that I would know since there have been donations in my honor and I've
been a department chair.  However, these kinds of issues don't seem to 
stick in my brain.

[9] No, that's not the same as planned giving.  We did do planned giving
to Grinnell, but that's a subject for another musing.

[10] Or say to ourselves, when I did it with Michelle.

[11] I don't have an exact count.

[12] There are enough people to honor that I don't think I'd ever manage to
honor them all.

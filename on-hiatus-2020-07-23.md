I have an amazing family.  It's been great to have them home or
nearby since Father's day.

I have wonderful students.  I especially appreciate my summer research
students, who brighten each day.  I also love being able to work with
Youngest Son, who is once again contributing to the MIST project.

It's not just my research students; I also appreciate the other
students I've taught at Grinnell.  And I'm looking forward to
teaching my Tutorial students, or at least the portion of my Tutorial
students who arrive this fall.

I'm thrilled by the many graduates I know, wonderful students who
have become even more wonderful adults.  I appreciate their willingness
to engage in discussions and dialogue from time to time.  I even
more appreciate their support for current students.  And I like
seeing their accomplishments.

I am so lucky to have such wonderful colleagues in the CS department.

I value the many colleagues I have across campus.  I include staff,
faculty, and even administrators in my list of people I consider
colleagues.  As I said in a workshop today, I seek advice from many
of them and trust that advice.

I feel lucky to have Elaine Marzluff as Acting Dean.  Despite my
frustration at President Harris' recent letter, I feel fortunate
to have her as president.  As I've noted repeatedly, I find her
thoughtful, articulate, and someone who can move Grinnell in new
and positive directions.

I'd like to continue writing musings of thanks and appreciation to
all these groups.

But I can't do it anymore.

I can't stay positive while working the equivalent of two unpaid
nearly-full-time jobs (preparing Tutorial for the fall and Chairing
a Department) while also having a life and supervising my research
students.  I've worked between twelve and fourteen hours each night
this week.  It's too much.

I can't stay positive while having to repeatedly argue for the
things I and others need to successfully teach online, to have to
argue for bandwidth, and software, and iPads for my colleagues,
while ITS seems to think that we are lucky to receive webcams and
headphones and microphones [1].  What good is any of this if faculty
don't have the bandwidth for reasonable-quality video conferencing?
And what kind of institution thinks it's worthwhile trumpeting the
webcams and headphones and microphones to parents as the great
technology we are providing to faculty to ensure successful online
classes?  I can't deal with policies that regularly interfere with
my ability to teach, to do research.  As I've said, [I appreciate
the staff in ITS](thankful-its-2020-07-21) as individuals.  But the
big picture?  It's flawed.

I can't stay positive when my college president fails to defend
faculty, fails to "call them in rather than call them out", as a
colleague says.  I probably shouldn't have written a public response
to her letter.  It's clear from some notes I received that it will
damage my ability to achieve some of my goals, particularly my goals
of diversifying my department.  It may even damage my department
in other ways.  But someone had to speak out.

I can't stay positive when virus cases are increasing rapidly and I
see people in my town unmasked, unconcerned, expecting things to be
fine.

I can't stay positive when all I can see for November is a Biden
victory and then a Trumpian declaration of martial law.  Or maybe
a Russian hack of the Republican-promoted electronic voting machines.

I can't stay positive in a society of systemic racism, a society that
denies that systemic racism.

Maybe I shouldn't think so globally.  If I do so, I'll never be able to
cope.  Let's return to the local.

I can't stay positive when I'm not sure that a year from now we'll
have the staffing we need.  Or maybe I can be optimistic about that.
Perhaps if the other issues were not at play, I would be.

I can't stay positive watching the treatment of colleagues who have
given decades of their lives to this institution.  And no, it's not
just those from President Harris' letter.

I can't stay positive amidst the repeated microaggressions against
me or my discipline.  A trustee who says "Why would a computer
scientist care about the humanities?"  Colleagues who ignore my
discipline when discussing the sciences [2].  Colleagues who suggest
that other faculty could teach our introductory course; after all,
"it's just programming" and anyone who programs can teach programming
[3].  Guess what?  It's not.  Intro CS is a way of thinking.  And
it's a very different way of thinking.  I see far too many people
who learned to program but not to think computationally.

I can't stay positive dealing with an administrator who spent the
second half of the spring telling me that "technological minimalism"
was essential, without ever actually realizing that Blackboard
Collaborate only shows a few people at a time.  How the hell am I
supposed to teach if I can't see my students' faces? [4]  

I look forward to seeing the College enforcing this minimalist
approach for all disciplines.  Chemistry gets oxygen and hydrogen.
That's enough, right?  Art History gets Thomas Kinkade [5], painter
of light.  Why would one study anything else?  We don't want to put
too much stress on our students.  Linguistics can teach about
three-letter one-syllable words, nothing more.  And they must also
restrict themselves to such words in what they say to students.
Keep it simple, minimalist!  English?  _Dick and Jane_ should
suffice.  Music?  C-major, one octave.  That's incredibly generous.
Art?  One purple crayon per student.  I guess that's one case that
might succeed; you can create a world with one purple crayon [6].

I can't stay positive knowing that we consider "this has 80% of the
features you need in your software" to be a close-enough match.

I can't stay positive knowing that classes start in one month and
one day while considering the huge number of things I need to do
that have nothing to do with getting ready for those classes.

I can't stay positive when I get called out (or is it called in) by
an administrator for telling a student that "I feel sorry that the
College treated you poorly" [7].

I love to muse.  It helps me learn.  It helps me think.  It helps
me connect with others.  It helps me express appreciation.  It helps.

But I know that these days, if I muse, I'll rant.  If I rant, I'll
burn more bridges.  I've probably burnt too many already.  I likely
burnt more in the text above.  They may not burn as brightly as the
comet overhead, but I've burnt them nonetheless.  Perhaps I should
care.  I don't.

So the musings are going on hiatus.  For how long, I do not know.
I may still write.  But I will not post.  It won't do you good.  It
won't do me good.  Or maybe I won't write.  I have a lot of time I
need to spend on those unpaid jobs. Or, better yet, I could spend
more time with my family.  We'll see [8].

See you sometime.

**_Postscript_**: You know how song lyrics regularly enter my mind.
As I was editing this, I kept hearing the first two lines of Cat
Stevens' "Can't Keep It In".

> Oh, I can't keep it in.

> I can't keep it in; I gotta let it out.

If only my brain moved on to the next two lines.

> I gotta show the world, world's gotta see.

> See all the love, love that's in me.

Unfortunately, that second line (or perhaps my ability to express
that line) is being drowned out by the noise from everything else.

[1] Okay, having high-quality microphones is important to make sure that
those with hearing impairments can hear me clearly.

[2] You may consider that minor.  Since I've seen our students lose
opportunities because "CS is not a science", even though CS students
are explicitly eligible for those opportunities, I consider it a huge
problem.

[3] Yes, I know that our Statisticians experience the same bias.

[4] I am not suggesting that all faculty need to see their students'
faces.  Certainly, those with limited or no sight teach successfully
without seeing those faces.  But I am accustomed to seeing my students'
faces and hearing their responses.  The silenced voices are bad enough.
Loss of both voices and images is like teaching to a blank wall.

[5] Is that like Kool-Aid?  Or something to help Ray and Dave?

[6] I guess I can still find some places to be positive.

[7] That happened a month or two ago. 

[8] You won't.  I will.

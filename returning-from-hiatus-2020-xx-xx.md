Some time ago, I [put my musing on hiatus](on-hiatus-2020-07-23).  It
was a dark time.  At least it was a dark time for me.  I was doing too
much work.  I was finding myself at conflict with my institution about
software, policies, faculty governance, more.  I was feeling the
pressures of pandemic, facism, systemic racism.  I was worrying about
how I was contributing to systemic racism.  When I sat down to write,
all I wanted to do was rant.  And since most of my attention goes to
my work, I found myself starting to rant about everything that was
frustrating to me about Grinnell.

Some rants help the ranter [1].  Some rants help move things forward
or create change [2].  But other rants only do damage.  I was getting
close to the stage that all I would post was damaging rants.  And
I didn't want to do so.  It wasn't healthy for me.  It would not
be healthy for my relationships with other people, including many
people I respect highly.  So I did the only sensible thing.

I took a hiatus.

I also did one other thing.  I explained why.  I ranted, although
in language other than I might normally use.  And certainly more
concisely than normal [3,4].  A beloved friend and colleague noted
that I was "astute and eloquent in [my] despair".  That got a lot
of the rants out.  That got a lot of the despair out.  Putting
things down can help.  Nothing got better immediately.  Part of the
frustration I was feeling that it seemed like nothign would.  Some
things got worse.

But I felt able to move on.

Here's the thing.  Musing is now part of who I am [6,7].  I knew I'd
continue to write a bit; I just didn't plan to post what I was
writing.  Knowing that I was not posting [8] meant that I did not
feel compelled to rant.  It helped that I'd ranted already.  But I
did not feel the need to lay out the details, to pull no punches,
to express the built-up frustrations, to share these concerns with
others who seemeed oblivious and those who had similar concerns but
were not as comfortable expressing them in public.  And so I was
still able to muse.

So I mused.  At least at first, I should have mused less.  Musing
takes time away from other activities.  But it was healing.

Should I have made those musing public?  No.  Part of what allowed
me to muse positively was that I was not posting to the public.  If
I was posting, I would want to continue to complain, to share my
frustrations in the hopes that things would get better before the
semester started.  And that would make things worse, given how
unlikely it was that I would see improvement [9].

Enough time has passed that I'm comfortable posting again.  I have
a backlog.  A fairly long backlog.  Some of the musings are no
longer relevant.  But you'll see many of them.  I hope to intersperse
new musings with backlogged musings.  We'll see what my muse insists
upon.

**_Postscript_**: I received many words of kindness after posting the
musing, some clearly spurred by the musing and others seemingly
coincidental [10].  I appreciated them all. I feel obligated to share
a few.

The person who has known me longest wrote, in part, "I could only
think how proud your father and your mother would be to read what
you just wrote".  It made me cry, but it made me happy.

Big hearted folks called me big hearted.

Folks who think through issues carefully told me they appreciated
my analyses.

Too many people seemed to be in the same state, overwhelmeed and
frustrated.  That makes me sad.

I know I make a difference to people, irrespective of my musings.
But it's nice to know that musings make a difference, too.

[1] That's me.

[2] I know that my [rant about President Harris'
letter](inclusion-2020-07-22) angered a lot of people.  It's probably
damaged more of my relationships than almost anything I've done.
At the same time, it helped people who felt similar things, but did
not feel they had the social capital to say so in public.

[3] Concision.  Sam.  Two great things that rarely go together.

[4] Here's evidence.  I didn't need that "than normal" [5].  

[5] I also didn't need these endnotes.

[6] I was tempted to say "Writing is now part of who I am", but that
does not seem correct.  Writing these notes is now part of who I am,
a way I think through issues, live part of my life in the open,
connect with others.  While I needed to do less of the middle thing,
even though it led to less of the last, I still needed to think
through issues.

[7] I suppose I could write "'blogging", since I refer to the musings
as "my 'blog".  But "'blogging" carries different connotations.  Like
'writing", the term seems too broad.

[8] Or at least not posting immediately.

[9] Damn.  I was feeling good.  Then I wrote that paragraph.  Yeah,
thinking actively about the problems would not be a positive.

[10] I like "coinkydink", but neither "coinkydinkal" nor "coinkydental" 
seems to work well as a term.

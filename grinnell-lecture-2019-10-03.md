Nominations for the Grinnell Lecture
====================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnellians](index-grinnell)*

Mike Latham made many valuable changes while he was at Grinnell.
One of my favorites was an annual celebration of faculty scholarship.
As part of that celebration, one faculty member is chosen to give
the Grinnell Lecture.  A host of impressive folks have given those
lectures.  If I recall correctly, our first five Grinnell lectures
were by Tyler Roberts in Religious Studies, Bill Ferguson in
Economics, Leslie Lyons in Chemistry, Shonda Kuiper in Statistics,
and Vince Eckhart in Biology [1].  Each year, the faculty are encouraged
to nominate their peers for the lecture.  I've never nominated anyone.
It's not that I don't think there are people who are worth nominating;
it's more that I don't feel that I have deep enough knowledge of the
colleagues that I would like to nominate.    Nonetheless, since tomorrow
is the deadline for nomination, I thought I'd share a few notes about
who I might nominate.  The list is necessarily incomplete; I have way
too many colleagues that I respect highly, and, as I said, I don't
know nearly enough about many colleagues.  In any case, it's fun
to think about possible candidates, particularly ones I'd like to
hear speak.  Here goes.  I've arranged the list by first name.

_Alissa Nutting_.  Nutting is a talented writer, one whose novels
speak to a host of issues in modern American society.  Her work is
strong enough that it is being adapted to television, or so I
understand.  Nutting, along with Dean Bakopoulos, has also brought
important new characteristics to our creative writing program [2].
How often do we have folks on campus who have the knowledge and
skill to be both Writer in Residence and a faculty member?

_Celeste Miller_.  Celeste has built a strong dance program at
Grinnell.  But it's the variety of her work in choreography and
dance that makes me consider her an appropriate candidate for the
Grinnell Lecture.  I know of interesting collaborations that involve
telepresence, training of physicians, multiple disciplines, and
more.  In our conversations, I appreciate the thoughtful way she
seems to approach all she does, from her dance to her teaching.

_Jerod Weinman_.  I don't think we should have another scientist
give the Grinnell Lecture this year.  But if I did, Jerod would be
one of my top candidates.  Jerod does interesting, complex, and
valuable work on computer vision.  His current work on text recognition
in historical maps has received accolades at conferences and represents
a wonderful intersection between computing and the humanities.  Jerod
is also known as a challenging teacher and has one of the most
thorough advising syllabi I know of.

_Lee Emma Running_.  Lee is an incredibly talented artist who works in
a variety of media.  The sculptures she installed at Grinnell
Regional Medical Center not only engage the mind but also induce
peace and relaxation.  Her current project on the fate of deer on
the highway is moving and challenging.  And I look forward to seeing what
she does as director of the Center for Prairie Studies.

_Marc Chamberland_.   Like Jerod, Marc falls into the category of
people who I think should give the Grinnell Lecture, but probably
should not give it this year.  Marc has been doing a wonderful
job on what I'd call "mathematics outreach", with a trade book
on one-digit numbers and a quite popular YouTube channel.  Public
scholarship is important to Grinnell, and Marc's work should be
acknowledged.  (I'll admit I don't know enough about Marc's "real"
work in mathematics.)

_Ralph Savarese_. Ralph just released a very important book, _See
It Feelingly: Classic Novels, Autistic Readers, and the Schooling
of a No-Good English Professor_.  More broadly, Ralph does incredible
work at the intersection of language and autism that deserves
recognition by the College.  Ralph's also no slouch on that big
whale, either.  Plus, Ralph is as much of a curmudgeon as I am [4].

_Sarah Purcell_.  Sarah's been doing quite creative work in 
digital humanities, or digital history, or virtual history [5],
or whatever you want to call it.  I've written previously about
[her broader import to the College](sarah-purcell).  I'd love to
see her give a Grinnell Lecture on her most recent work.

_Tammy Nyden_.  Like Ralph and Sarah, Tammy seems to have gone in
a new direction since starting at Grinnell.  While I know Tammy
does important work in philosophy, I'd want to see her give the
Grinnell Lecture about her even more important work on what she
terms the "school to prison pipeline", the way that certain groups
of students encounter situations and policies that nudge them closer
and closer to prison, rather than to success.  I particularly
appreciate her work to bring together different groups to share
their experience and advocacy, rather than focusing just on one
group.

That's my quick, off the cuff, list of people who I think would
make great Grinnell Lecturers.  As I said, I know that there are
many more; Grinnell has a host of wonderful faculty who do interesting
work and are good (and, sometimes, exceptional) speakers.  I imagine
the work of selecting the Grinnell Lecture recipient must be a
difficult one.

Personally, I'd like to see someone whose scholarship is in the arts
give the next lecture.  Too rarely do we acknowledge the great
contribution of our artists, dancers, theatrical designers and
directors, creative writers, and other creative individuals.  It
would also be a nice change after three years of scientists.

As I said, I don't feel like I have deep enough knowledge of any
of these individuals [6] to write a full-fledged nomination.  I
hope that my short notes inspire someone else to nominate one or
more of these awesome folks, or one of the other awesome faculty
on campus [7].

Postscript: I just reread the message about the nomination process.
It's easier than I thought.  You don't need to write a nomination
letter.  You just need to pass on a name.  At that point, the Dean's
office asks the nominee to supply additional details.  I don't think
I can nominate all eight [8] of the people above, but I'll nominate a
few.  You can still do the same [9].

[1] All of those folks would have given excellent Scholars' Convocations.

[2] I suppose one could nominate Alissa and Dean Bakopounutts [3].  But
that's up to someone else to decide.

[3] "Bakopounutts" is likely a registered trademark of Alissa Nutting
and Dean Bakopoulus.  If it's not, it should be.

[4] I hope he doesn't mind the comparison.

[5] That's probably the wrong term for "VR + history", but I'm sticking
with it.

[6] With the exception of Jerod Weinman.

[7] We also have some awesome staff who could be candidates for something
like the Grinnell lecture.  However, the design of the lecture and the
nomination process limits both recipients and nominators to faculty.

[8] Nine, if you include Dean.

[9] At least if you're a faculty member.

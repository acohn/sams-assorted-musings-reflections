A letter to our new dean
========================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), academia, rambly*

As I noted a few days ago, [our new dean has arrived on campus](new-dean-2019-08-28).  I believe that she's been at Grinnell for about two months now.  She's likely already heard about me.  Even if she hasn't, she's seen email messages
from me that show my positive seide (e.g., my efforts get Grinnell to
begin planning for 
recognize the 50th anniversary of the open curriculum)

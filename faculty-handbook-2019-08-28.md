Getting things right (or reason #2319 that Sam is a curmudgeon)
===============================================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), academia*

*Warning: In portions of this rant, you will likely find that I both 
brag and whine even more than normal.*

It's been over twenty years since I signed my acceptance of Grinnell's
offer of a position in computer science.  But I still recall the gist
of the letter: 

> We offer you the position of Assistant Professor of Computer Science.
  We will pay you $undisclosed.  All additional details of the contract
  may be found in the _Faculty Handbook_.

Now, I don't know about you, but I like to read my contracts [1].  So
I asked for a copy of the _Faculty Handbook_ before agreeing to sign.
I recall being impressed at the thoughtful approach to shared positions.

Since the _Faculty Handbook_ is our primary contract with the College,
I continue to pay attention to it.  I realize that we rarely follow it
exactly.  For example, once or twice a year, I send the Dean a message
that begins something like this.

> The Policy on Procedural Flexibility (p. 16 of the current Faculty
Handbook) indicates that "A faculty member should report to the Dean
of the College any intention to leave the campus for any period which
shall exceed two class days during the academic year."  I am writing to
report my intention to leave the campus for two such periods.

As far as I know, very few faculty follow this part of the contract [2].
Similarly, very few chairs follow the guidance on interactions with
the Student Educational Policy Committee [3].

> The Chair of the Department shall [...] meet regularly with the
departmental Student Educational Policy Committee to obtain its
impressions of the department’s programs and the performance of the
department’s faculty members. Such impressions should be reported,
when appropriate, to the faculty member concerned and to the Dean of
the College. [5]

I followed the policy when I was Chair, and I know that my successor has
also tried [8].  However, I recall a discussion at a Chair's meeting, and
we were clearly the outliers.  I've also heard of some fairly significant
pushback from faculty members when Chairs share these impressions.

Even though there are parts of the _Handbook_ that get treated lightly,
many other aspects, particularly those related to governance and
promotion/tenure, should be taken quite seriously.  I regularly consult
the _Handbook_ on such matters.  Since the _Handbook_ changes each year,
I tend to download a new copy at the start of each year.  Once in a while,
I'm away from my primary computer and end up referring back to [the online
version](http://web.grinnell.edu/dean/Handbook/FacultyHandbook.pdf).

This past year, when I did so, something quite strange happened.  The
_Handbook_ changed in the middle of the year.  And it changed multiple
times.  Let's see if I can identify all of the copies I've seen.

I downloaded my first copy on 12 September 2018.  That copy indicated
that the last revision was 4-18-2018 and that it was approved April 2018.
I took that to be the version of the _Faculty Handbook_ in play for the
2018-2019 academic year.

In early December, I ended up checking the online _Handbook_ and was
surprised to see that it said "Last Revision: 11-20-2018" and "Approved:
April 2018".  In my world, one doesn't revise the _Handbook_ and post
it without it being approved.  I suppose that there could be revisions
that were approved, but not yet incorporated.  But that's never happened
before, at least not while I was paying attention.  I did a quick skim of
changes, and what I found worried me.  Among other things, the procedures
for amending the _Faculty Handbook_ had changed and it appeared that
one of the modes of changing the _Handbook_ did not involve consultation
with the faculty.  I was unhappy, to say the least.  And I complained.
It turned out that some text intended for the _Trustee Handbook_ [9]
accidentally ended up in the _Faculty Handbook_, or at least that's
what I recalled.

The next version, which I found on December 12, indicated that its last
revision was 12-7-2018 and still noted that it was approved in April
2018. That version eliminated the troublesome text.  However, there were
unexpected changes elsewhere.  I complained about those, and identified
the relevant motions from the minutes of the faculty meetings.

The semester got busy enough that I didn't have time to look at these
issues again.  During the summer, I looked again.  And, you know what,
I found another version of the handbook.  Strangely enough, this one
differed from the previous one only in that it indicated that it was
approved in February 2019.  I assume that's because the Trustees approved
some changes at their February meeting [10].

A few days ago, I downloaded the latest version of the _Faculty 
Handbook_.  It indicates that it was last revised on 5/24/19 and
that it was approved on June 2019.  It includes some changes that
I was expecting, such as the regularization of the Committee on
Diversity.  But there still seem to be some changes that differ from
those approved by the faculty [11].

I've spent way too much of my time looking into these issues.  It's not
trivial to identify differences between versions of the _Handbook_,
to figure out where the corresponding legislation happened in faculty
meetings, and to suggest a correction.  Plus, I'm somewhat picky
about things, so I always spend more time looking for other possible
differences.  Checking the changes to the _Handbook_ shouldn't be my
job.  Does no one else care?  It is, after all, our contract.  I'd also
think that the College would care, since inconsistent changes to the
_Handbook_ potentially leave us liable [12].  But what do I know?

I don't think any of what I've reported has to do with someone being
intentionally malicious.  Everyone I work with is thoughtful and caring.
I just assume that most are overworked.

Still, I keep wondering: Is it really that hard to get these things right?

Postscript: The 2719 is an invented number.  I don't really keep track of
all the reasons that I'm a curmudgeon.

---

[1] No, I don't read all of my shrink-wrap licenses.  But I probably should.

[2] I know that some other members of the department do.  I expect that
my influence had something to do with it.

[3] Student Educational Policy Committees typically play two important
roles in the life of the department: They help manage the social aspect
of the department and they are the conduit for student voices on hiring
and promotion.  Many SEPCs also contribute to discussions of curriculum
and other aspects of departmental business.  Unfortunately, the definition
of SEPCs is not in the _Faculty Handbook_ and, for a time, disappeared
from the _Student Handbook_ [4].

[4] That reminds me: I need to muse about ownership of the _Student
Handbook_.

[5] Grinnell College. _Faculty Handbook_.  Last revision: 5/24/19.
Approved: June 2019.  Found online at 
<http://web.grinnell.edu/dean/Handbook/FacultyHandbook.pdf> [6].  p. 12.

[6] I recall being told a few years ago that web.grinnell.edu was slated
to go away.  I wonder why we're still using it for public documents [7].

[7] Okay, I don't really wonder. After too many years, Grinnell still 
does not have an appropriate Web site for public documents.

[8] He does not attempt the bi-weekly meetings I attempted.

[9] Or whatever they call their handbook.

[10] Yes, those are changes the Faculty previously approved.

[11] And the Trustees, or so I assume.

[12] I am not a lawyer.

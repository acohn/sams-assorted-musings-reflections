Preliminary registration for [Grinnell's first set of online summer
courses](summer-2020-classes-2020-05-03) wrapped up the other day.
It doesn't look like it went as well as we expected.  CSC-151,
_Functional Problem Solving w/lab_, has ten students enrolled;
ANT-210, _Illness, Hearing and Culture_, has nine.  Nothing else
has more than five, although everything has at least one.

Most of the summer courses sound awesome, awesome enough that I'd like
to enroll (and other people asked me if they could enroll).  Some,
like ECN-226, _Economics of Innovation_, are usually significantly
over-enrolled when offered during the academic year.  

So why are the enrollments this summer so low?

In part, it's likely because we limited who could enroll.  If I
recall correctly, only two categories of students were invited:
Students currently living on campus who want to stay during the
summer and students who were abroad in the spring.  I'm not even
sure that all members of either group were invited.  Given that
those staying on campus will be paying $1,200 for housing and $1,800
for meals for the full summer, I assume many will want to work to
offset those costs.  Most can only work twenty hours per week, which
is only $1,700 at a salary of $8.50/hour.  I know less about those
returning from abroad.

I expect that there's also an uncertainty about learning online,
particularly for the students returning from abroad.  I have no
idea what their experiences with remote learning were like, but my
understanding is that, across the country, remote learning experiences
were less good than in-person experiences.

What happens next?

I'm not sure.  The administrators in charge of this program are
probably overwhelmed right now as they try to get ready to give
President Kington recommendations for the fall.  I expect we'll
hear an announcement soon.  I can see a few possible options: We
might open enrollment to a larger group of students and wait another
week.  We might cancel most of the classes; I seem to recall that
the goal was ten students in a class.  But if we do that, what
happens to the students who enrolled in the classes we canceled
and how will they feel?  Would enough of them shift to another
of the lower-enrollment classes to make it worth keeping some?  Or
will we put the kibosh on the whole experiment?

I hope that we find a way to keep some of the classes.  As I said,
I'd love to be able to sit in on some of them.

Using comments from end-of-course evaluations
=============================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), Grinnell*

Last year, while I was conducting a faculty review, I read the following 
text in the instructions.

> [For interim reviews] The dossier usually consists simply of this
departmental letter, the most recent Faculty Activity Report, and
the curriculum vitae of the faculty member, along with course lists,
enrollments, and summary quantitative data, *as well as qualitative
comments from end-of-course evaluations* provided by the Dean’s
office. [1,2]

> [For complete reviews] Summaries of numeric data, *as well as
qualitative comments from end-of-course evaluations* are provided
to the review chair and Personnel Committee for their use. [3]

I was surprised, to say the least.  Why?  Because when the faculty
approved the use of campus-wide end-of-course evaluations, we
explicitly voted *not* to provide those comments to the Personnel
Committee [4].  In addition, the instructions we read aloud when
distributing end-of-course evaluations include the following
statement.

> Instructors receive the completed, original forms only after
grades have been submitted to the Registrar. Department chairs
receive copies of the completed forms. *These are the only people
who may read your comments unless the faculty member or the department
chair chooses to include anonymous quotes in documents prepared for
the faculty member’s next review.* [5,6]

So I did what you'd expect me to do.  I visited the College archives
to find the original legislation [7], I dug out the instructions
from the end-of-course evaluations, and, using the documents that
I had dug out, I verified my recollections.  Then I wrote a letter
to the Dean expressing my concerns.  I also talked to a few senior
colleagues, who were as surprised as I was.  Some were surprised for
other reasons; I recall the one of them said something like,
"Personnel already has so much to read; I can't imagine them wanting
to read all of the end-of-course evaluation comments, too" [8,9].
I heard back from the Dean that he was surprised to see all this,
but that he understood my concerns.  He even reaffirmed my
interpretation at the faculty meeting of 15 October 2018.

> As a follow up, Dean Latham acknowledged that our practice of ensuring that textual comments in student end-of-course evaluations will continue to be shared solely with the faculty member and chair. [10]

I thought things were settled.

It turns out that I was wrong.

This fall, a new set of guidelines appeared [11].  Although the
name at the top of the document is different, the content is similar.
The statements about qualitative comments are the same.
I was concerned, to say the least.  So I sent a letter of concern
to Dean Harris and some members of Council.  A few weeks later, I
got a response.  There were two parts to the response.

First, I was told that a recent EC/Personnel Committee meeting
"expanded the use of EOCEs to include qualitative data."  Second, I
was told that the faculty vote on EOCEs again restricted that use to
department chairs (or designees) who were reviewing outliers.

The first response is *absurd*.  Council and Personnel originally
proposed the use of EOCEs to the full faculty.  In response, the
faculty explicitly limited the use.  It should not be within the
purview of Council and Personnel to again expand that use without
the approval of the faculty as a whole [14].  It's actions like this that
make me worry about what I consider a dangerous shift of how faculty
governance is interpreted at Grinnell; under President Kington, it
seems to be much more "representative governance", along with a
view that the representatives can make decisions without consulting
the faculty as a whole, rather than an understanding that there are
benefits from involving the whole faculty.

The second response is puzzling.  I don't recall an explicit
discussion of the use of EOCE comments in the broader discussion
of EOCEs.  It's certainly within the purview of the Department or
Review Chair to use end-of-course-evaluation comments to use those
comments to provide additional information on outliers.  But it's
also within the purview of the Department or Review Chair to choose
to use comments for other reasons.  I had thought things had stayed
the same.  I should also admit that I voted against the use of
end-of-course evaluations during the two-year study period that we
just began.

Once again, I also had a conversation with a more senior faculty member.
They noted that it could be argued that the Personnel Committee implicitly
has access to the comments since the _Faculty Handbook_ explicitly
states that they may seek other information.  I checked, and I think
this is what they were referring to.

> The Dean or the Faculty Personnel Committee may return the departmental report to the review chair for additional information or evaluation. The Faculty Personnel Committee also may seek information on its own initiative. [15]

I understand how some might read that as giving access to the EOCE
comments, but I don't think it does.  The faculty voted not to give
access to those comments, and the instructions explicitly say that
they are not made broadly available, so I don't think PC's "initiative"
should override that.  Personnel can't look at my tax returns, my
advisee folders, whatever documents I keep in my lower-right-hand
desk drawer, and such.  They can seek that information, but I don't
think others should provide it to them.

As you can likely tell, all of this frustrates me.  But it also
puzzles me.  Why am I the only one who seems to have noticed that
this had happened?  Why am I the only one who seems to have complained?
If I'm the only one who notices or cares, does any of this matter?
And, given the potential legal issues surrounding faculty reviews,
why do administrators allow these kinds of things to happen?

I have no answer to any of those questions.  I wish I did.

For now, my biggest concerns are what I see as a change in our model
of faculty governance and the question of whether I should stop caring
about these kinds of things.

Postscript: I'm not sure whether or not we should share end-of-course
evaluation comments with the Personnel Committee.  On the one hand,
being able to read the comments would give PC better insight into the
bias in evaluations.  On the other hand, it's not clear that the members
of PC have the training to understand the possible biases [16].  I
would not give the comments to the Council (more precisely, the subset
of Council that forms the Faculty Salary Committee).  Their work is already
busy enough; having to read hundreds of EOCEs for each of the fifty-or-so
faculty they review each year would be nearly impossible.

However, I do think we should share comments from end-of-course evaluations
with the Task Force that is studying EOCEs and making recommendations for the
future of EOCEs.  I would recommend that the faculty vote to give that
access to the Task Force.  I assume the Task Force would have to ask, first.

Postscript: I am not on the Faculty Evaluation Task Force.  If I weren't
on leave, I would have considered volunteering.  In the past, I might
have volunteered; I certainly did way too much on campus during my
prior leaves [17].  This time, I'm doing my best to protect my time.

[14] When I was on Council, and we wanted access to summary data
on only two questions, we brought the question to the faculty as a

of those data, which we did.  Unfortunately, I've been told that
our successors did not.

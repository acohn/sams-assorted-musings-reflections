My [first piece for _The Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_](homework-1B-2020-02-xx) was a description of place
about my office.  My first name for it was incredibly obtuse:
_The only mainstream novel by Fredric Brown_.  That likely makes no
sense to you.  In fact, I expect it makes sense to fewer than one
hundred people.

Here's the backstory.  [Fredric
Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown) was a genre
author in the 40's, 50's, and 60's.  He wrote science fiction and
mystery, both short stories and novels.  He's known for a variety of
things.  He wrote some fairly funny pieces, at least in SF.  His first
mystery novel won an Edgar Award.  He was known for his skill at
"short-shorts", stories as concise as you can make them.  You can
read more on [the Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown).

Brown also wrote one mainstream novel, _The Office_.  I know this
primarily because I collect Brown and it was a hard book to find.
I'm not sure that I've ever read it [1].  But the concept sticks in
my head.

When I had the obscure title, I was trying to find a way to work in
what I think of as one of his most successful short-shorts, "Knock".
Here's the story, as I recall it.

> The last man on Earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on
the door ...

I'm pretty sure that it appeared that way in print.  However,
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown) tells me
that Brown placed that short-short at the begnning and end of a
longer story.  I'm going to ignore that broader aspect, particularly
since the broader story is a bit cheesy.

Before I go on, let me repeat the story.

> The last man on Earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on
the door ...

How do you read that?  Would you read it differently if I hadn't told
you that it was science fiction?  Or is the SF implicit?  Read it
one more time.

> The last man on Earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on
the door ...

What does your imagination conjure?

When I first read it, I thought of aliens.  What else would it be?
But it reveals a morass of others SF tropes.  It could be a robot.
It could be a giant mutant cockroach.  It could be a remote knock
from the hordes of humans now in space.

Then there's the question of his status in the room.  Has he placed
himself in the room, or has someone else placed him there?  Is he free
to move about the room, or is he tied to the chair, straps digging into
his arms and legs?  Is he free to leave?  Can he open the door, or is the
knock a subtle form of torture?  I like that in this form, Brown doesn't
tell you.  Rather, he leaves you to imagine.  Or at least he leave sme
to imagine.

Forty or so years since I first read the story, I think of it
differently.  It's still SF, but with a different twist.  "Man" no
longer stands for "human".  So in some ways, this could be a subtle
poke at how we read.  He may be the last man, but there could be
millions of women left.  Or children.  How would we read the story if it
were published in a feminist 'zine?

At least that's what I thought about when I was writing my piece
for class and reflecting on what I might put in this musing.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown) tells me
that, in his longer story, Brown played with the same concepts.  He
opens the story with the short-short.  And it is an alien knocking
on the door.  He also ends the story with the short-short.  This
time, it's a woman knocking.

While that may sound good, it's a bit clumsier than I would like.
As you might expect, the woman knocking is the last woman on earth.
And the man got the aliens to leave by relying on a poisonous snake.
That's way too biblical.  Fifteen-year-old Sam probably found it funny.
Fifty-five-year-old Sam not only finds it a bit ham-handed, but
worries about the way it represents the woman in the story.

So let's just think return to the short-short, and let our imaginations
tell our own broader story.

the door ...

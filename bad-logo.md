Why?
====

When Grinnell rolled out [the new visiual
identity](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/communications/brand/visual-identity),
our Web site got a version of the new logo at the top of every page.

Here it is:

<img src="images/grinnell_main_logo_0.png" alt="The Grinnell College logo, poorly rendered">

What's wrong with this version?  Let's compare it to the primary SVG
[1] version.

<img src="images/grinnell-logo.svg" width="325" alt="The Grinnell College logo">

The comparison illustrates many of the problems of the logo they chose
to use.

* It's the wrong red.
* The bottom of the "g" is cut off.
* It's fuzzy, rather than crisp.

Why did they convert an SVG to png?  I have no idea.  Why is the
conversion inadequate?  I also have no idea.  Why didn't they fix it
during the first weeks of the campaign?  That I don't know either.

So I'm just left to ask: *Why?*

[1] Scalable vector graphics.  SVG provides a way to describe images
that scales well and leaves clean, clear, crisp lines.

Why?
====

When Grinnell rolled out [the new visual
identity](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/communications/brand/visual-identity),
our Web site got a version of the new logo at the top of every page.

Here it is:

<img src="images/grinnell_main_logo_0.png" alt="The Grinnell College logo, poorly rendered">

What's wrong with this version?  Let's compare it to the primary SVG
[1] version.

<img src="images/grinnell-logo.svg" width="325" alt="The Grinnell College logo">

The comparison should illustrate many of the problems of the logo they 
initially used [2].

* The bottom of the "g" is cut off.
* It's the wrong red.
* It's mostly fuzzy, rather than crisp.
* The left edge is crisp, which contrasts strangely with the more general
  fuzziness.

I reported the first two issues as soon as I noticed them.  It took
about a month from the initial report to the correct logo appearing.
At least it's fixed now.

Why did they convert an SVG to png?  I have no idea.  Why is the
conversion inadequate?  I also have no idea.  Why did they post a poorly
rendered image in the first place?  No clue.  Why didn't they fix it
during the first weeks of the campaign?  That I don't know either.

So I'm just left to ask: *Why?*

Postscript: As I've written in the past, I think highly of our Webmasters.
I'm left to think that we have strange processes in place that are out
of their control.

[1] Scalable vector graphics.  SVG provides a way to describe images
that scale well and leaves clean, clear, crisp lines.

[2] You can ignore the offset issue.  That can be fixed in other ways.
I'm just too lazy to do that for this partial musing.

Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Adrienne Squier
=============================================================

*Part of an ongoing series about the people who inhabit or have
inhabited Grinnell's campus.*

When we think about the people at Grinnell, we tend to think about 
primarily about three groups: the students, who are the reason Grinnell 
exists; the faculty, who conduct the primary work of the institution
in teaching and mentoring our students and in advancing knowledge; and
the staff, who do everything else.  Some members of staff are obvious:
Students know about the members of student affairs, many administrators,
folks at the dining hall, their custodial staff (one hopes), and such.
But there are a lot of people who also work "behind the scenes" to make
Grinnell successful.  They are usually worth knowing; they also deserve
both thanks and respect.  One such person is Adrienne Squier, our Social
Media Specialist [1].  I will admit that I don't know Adrienne nearly
as well as I should, so this essay will be less complete or extensive
than I would like [3].  Nonetheless, I think you'll find it a useful
introduction.

What does a Social Media Specialist do?  I don't know everything.
However, as far as I can tell, Adrienne handles almost all of the public
media associated with Grinnell, other than our primary Web presences.
So she deals with our Twitter feeds (and monitors lots of feeds to
see what's happening), our Facebook page, and more [4,6].  She's also
working on what looks to be an awesome site [7] that will pull together
these various sources.  It's already one of the better ways to tell 
what is happening on campus.

So, why do I appreciate Adrienne, and why should you?  The forthcoming
site is one reason; it's really one of the better things I've seen coming
out of Grinnell.

More importantly, she's good (probably great) at what she does.  We've had
a lot of years in which it was clear that Grinnell did not understand
social media [8].  I've seen problems that range from an inability to
build an audience to a complete misunderstanding of intellectual property
[9] to some concerning issues with privacy.  And, when people [10]
complained about these issues, their complaints were met with dismissal,
rather than thoughtful discussion.

Of course, none of that explicitly tells you why I think Adrienne is
good at what she does.  But it implies many.  Our social media feeds
are more interesting than they've been in the past, and often more 
informative than either www.grinnell.edu or GrinCo.  For example, the
only place I've seen something about the $10 million grant a Grinnell
alum got to start a new high school was on our Facebook page [11].
We don't seem to have the same problems we've had in the past with
understanding of what is and is not appropriate.  Or, at least, I haven't
heard of problems.  And, knowing Adrienne, I'm confident that she would
listen thoughtfully to such concerns and would respond appropriately.

Because Adrienne is our social media specialist, I see her at a lot of
campus events - convocations, data presentations, whatever.  And she's
a great person to talk to.  She's thoughtful about the College and she
pays attention to what's happening in talks (both content and issues of
presentation).  I'll admit that I enjoy watching her multitask while doing
her job: paying attention to the presentation, watching various social
media feeds to see what people are saying, adding her own commentary
on some feeds (well, adding the College's commentary), and so on and
so forth.  I'm sure that it doesn't help to have me sitting next to her,
posting snarky Tweets and looking over her shoulder, but she manages.

I think Adrienne succeeds well in her roles not only because she pays
attention and multitasks, but because she has a clear personality and
is fun and funny to read and listen to.  It doesn't always come out in
the Grinnell posts, but it does shine through at times.

I also appreciate that Adrienne has a clear life beyond Grinnell.  She has
a child who I anticipate seeing in my classroom one day (one who has
already managed to find a way to snag a "This is what a Grinnell Computer
Scientist looks like" t-shirt).  She volunteers to help her friends with
their plumbing [12].  She's at school events, listening and contributing.
In fact, I think the first time I met Adrienne was at an open School
Improvement Advisory Committee meeting, where someone introduced her as
our new (or relatively new) Social Media Specialist and I said something
clever like "You look much too young to have a child in school."

Perhaps most importantly, she was willing to wear a LOLcat mask for
[Narren Brown](narren-brown.html)'s farewell party.

[1] In our quest for TLAs, we'll say that she's an SMS.  I wonder if it
is intentional that someone who thinks about SMS [2] issues is also an
SMS.

[2] Simple Message Service.

[3] Yes, I know that I could ask certain folks about her, but that would
take additional effort.

[4] Okay, I'm old.  Grinnell probably uses other services, but I'm not
sure what people emphasize these days.  SnapChat?  Reddit? [5]  Instagram?
Tumblr?

[5] The idea of a Grinnell Reddit channel seems strange, but perhaps
there is one.

[6] Does Adrienne have a presence on [Plans](http://grinnellplans.com/)?
I don't think so.  Someone should add that to her job description.

[7] Yes, I've seen it.  No, I'm not allowed to provide a link to it.
Adrienne tells me that it's too buggy for public release, and was
surprised that I found it in the first place.

[8] I'll admit that I don't know how to use social media well.  But I
could still tell that we did a poor job.  I think part of the reason is
that we didn't make social media a real priority.

[9] Just because an alum tags a picture with #GrinnellReunion, it doesn't
mean that you can make your own copy and use it to promote the College
on a different social media service.

[10] And I'm not using "people" to mean "Sam".  I know folks who were
seriously upset about having their work repurposed by the College and
who complained about it.

[11] Well, I also saw it on the not-yet-public social-media-feed site.

[12] I told you I sit next to her at lots of talks.  And you hear lots
of things when you sit next to someone.

Organizing my mp3s
==================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

Recently, I described [my experience dealing with the shutdown of
Amazon Music Storage](amazon-music-storage).  If you recall, I was left
in the awkward situation that (a) Amazon would no longer accept uploads;
(b) I had not uploaded [1,2] a large portion of my collection; and (c)
it turns out that Amazon Music Storage screws up a lot

What next?  I'm trying to organize all the music on one hard drive.
But I know it will take time.  I'm still trying to figure out what to do
with the "these may not be right" and badly organized tunes I downloaded.
And I must admit that I live in fear of what happens if that drive dies.
I should probably clone it regularly [3].

Will I try another cloud storage system?  Google songs is free and
holds up to 50,000 songs.  Using that would require that I choose only
part of my collection to upload.  Apple Music Match also costs $29.99
per year and holds up to 100,000 songs.  If I ever get organized,
I'll have more than that.  

Will I ever have time to listen to 100,000 songs?  Let's see.  We'll
assume 3 minutes per song.  That 300,000 minutes, or 5,000 hours, or
625 eight-hour days, or about two years listening to music.  Hmmm ... it's
easier to achieve than I thought.  While I don't spend eight-hour days
actively listening to music, I do have music on most of the day while
I work.

I could ignore my collection and just use a service like Spotify.
But some of my favorite albums don't appear on such services.  My quick
check suggests that I would not be able to listen to _Nobody's Perfect_
by the Distractions, _Lo and Behold_ by Coulsen, Dean, McGuinnes, and
Flint, _Walking on a Wire_ by Lowen & Navarro, _When Things Go Wrong_ by
Robin Lane and the Chartbusters, _Halo_ by Paul Chastain, _Midnight Train_
by Darden Smith, and _Jonathan Sings! by Jonathan Richman.  And those are
just individual albums.  Folks like Michelle Shocked, Butch Hancock, and
Big Wooden Radio don't appear at all, or at least not outside of single
songs on compilations.  I suppose a mix of local storage and Spotify
would be a possibility.  However, services like Spotify can disappear.
I like having my collection both on my hard drives and in the cloud.  And,
well, it would take time to figure out what appears in Spotify and what
does not [4].

Oh well.  For now, I'll just try to organize what I have.  Perhaps the
long-term solution will be one of my sabbatical downtime projects.

[1] Or tagged.

[2] Or even ripped.

[3] When I wrote that, I started the process of backing up what I thought
was my primary disorganized collection of music.   It took overnight.  And
I think it's only a small portion of my collection.  We shall see.

[4] I will admit that I was surprised at how many favorites do appear.  For
example, they have relatively large collections of albums by both Jonathan
Richman and the Bad Examples.

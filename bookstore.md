College Bookstores
==================

In a recent note, President Kington wrote "The bookstore's primary mission
is to provide materials for the students as they pursue their degrees
and support for faculty instructional needs."  I find that a sadly
narrow view of college bookstores in general, and our bookstore in
particular.  So, let us instead consider my vision of a college bookstore
and perhaps even delve into the bookstore's current stated mission [1].

Importance of a bookstore for recruiting faculty.  If you had an option,
would you come to a college that didn't have a bookstore?  Probably not.

Importance to alumni.

Importance to our town.

Why do we expect the bookstore to cover its expenses?  I know.  It's because
it's a [best practice](best-practices.html); other institutions expect their
bookstores to cover expenses, or even make a profit, so we should to.  
However, we don't ask that of the many other organization on campus that,
on other campuses, are supposed to cover their expenses, or at least a
significant portion of their expenses.  Do our sports teams have to cover
expenses (e.g., through admissions)?  Nope.  We decided that it's more 
important to give students the opportunity to compete, and to encourage
people to attend and support them by being admission free [2].  Do our
theatrical productions have to charge admission to cover expenses?  No.
We think it's important that all students be able to attend cultural
events, and we also think it's important to provide cultural opportunities
to people in our town (and beyond), regardless of their income level.
Does our cultural events series, that brings in leading performs, many of
whom command ticket prices of $50 or more when they place elsewhere in
the state, need to break even?  No, once again, we do not charge admission
because we think students should be able to attend cultural events regardless
of their ability to pay, and that we have a responsiblity to bring such
events to our broader community.  So, I ask again: Why do we expect that
the bookstore has to cover its own expenses?  

(Do I worry, now that I've given this list, that the bean counters will
decide to charge for athletics, plays, musical events, and our cultural
events series?  Yes, I worry a bit.  But I also think that "events are
free at Grinnell" is embedded deeply in our culture, so I think there
would be significant enough pushback that it would not happen.  Or at
least I'll cross my fingers that it won't happen.)

I realize that we want to think about long-term sustainability of the wonderful
place that Grinnell is.  I realize that long-term sustainability includes
thinking carefully about finances.  But we need to think beyond finances,
or the thing we sustain will not be worth sustainance.

*Concluding paragraph.*

---

[1] I believe that the bookstore has been invited to revisit its mission
statement, which is now nearly twenty years old.

[2] Would people pay $5 or so to attend sporting events on campus?
I think so, although it might deter some students.  Would people
pay even more than $5 to see the legendary Pioneer Basketball team?
Almost certainly.  Should we charge?  Definitely not.

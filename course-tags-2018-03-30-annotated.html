<h1>Course tags and other alternatives</h1>


<p>At Monday's faculty meeting, we will be discussing course tags.
For those who've forgotten [<a href="#referent1" id="reference1">1</a>], the College has nine tags: Interpretation
of Art or Literature; Creative Expression; Critical Reading; Foreign
Language.  Quantitative Reasoning; Research; Scientific Method and
Analysis; Societies, Cultures, and Identities; and Writing.
What will we be discussing?  The Registrar's office computed a lot of
averages across multiple departments and years.  For example, we can
learn what percentage of students completed in each division completed
at least 4, 8, 12, or 16 credits in each of the nine tags [<a href="#referent2" id="reference2">2</a>].  We
can also see the average distribution of tags for each student.</p>

<p>While the people who instituted course tags are among the people I most
respect on campus [<a href="#referent2" id="reference2">2</a>], I have difficulty embracing tags as a way to
assess the kinds of education our students design for themselves with the
aid of their academic advisors and other faculty and staff.  Why?
Because I don't find that the tags accurately represent what we do and
the tags can be interpreted in multiple ways.</p>

<p>Let's take my own departmental experience as an example.  Conversations
suggest that many folks expected that computer science would naturally
choose the "Quantitative Reasoning" tag.  But quantitative reasoning
is not really what CS is about [<a href="#referent4" id="reference4">4</a>].  There's a reason that computer
scientists talk about "algorithmic thinking" or "computational thinking".
On the other hand, we eventually classified some of our courses as
"Writing" because students spend a lot of time writing proofs, which is
definitely a kind of writing [<a href="#referent5" id="reference5">5</a>].  But that's not likely what someone
reading the data would expect. So I'm left to ponder what we really
gain from the kinds of analysis that we're supposed to discuss on Monday.</p>

<p>I realize that our primary goal is to provide "data" [<a href="#referent6" id="reference6">6</a>] to our
assessors.  And I understand that this is the kind of data [<a href="#referent7" id="reference7">7</a>] they want
to see.  But the tags seem overly reductive [<a href="#referent8" id="reference8">8</a>]. Core to our identity as
academics is a willingness to embrace messiness and complexity. Let's
do so. As I've suggested in the past, we can know that a student
has designed a good liberal arts curriculum if and only if they can
successfully argue that their curriculum meets the goals of a liberal
arts education.  The implication goes both ways. If the curriculum they
designed is successful, they can make a good argument. If they make a
successful argument, they (or, more precisely, their arguments) convince
us of the quality of the curriculum.</p>

<p>Ooh!  Here's an idea. Let's take that claim seriously.  Just as
graduate students in most disciplines must pass a thesis defense, so
should Grinnell students pass a "curriculum defense". Let's see
... we could require a substantive essay when they declare the major
[<a href="#referent9" id="reference9">9</a>] and then a revised version before they preregister for their seventh
semester [<a href="#referent12" id="reference12">12</a>].  Why two different deadlines?  Because many students would
need the extra year of study to develop the skills and background to
successfully describe a liberal arts education and to make a compelling
case that what they have chosen meets the goals of such an education.</p>

<p>But the two essays are just one step.  We could also have them defend
their curriculum in front of a panel of faculty members.  I'd suggest a
relatively short defense; fifteen minutes or so.  I'm not yet sure how
we should form panels, but my initial inclination is a panel of three
faculty members from multiple areas [<a href="#referent14" id="reference14">14</a>], not including the student's
advisor (or advisors) [<a href="#referent15" id="reference15">15</a>].  Let's see ... we have a 9:1 student to
faculty ratio. On average, each faculty member would be responsible for
between two and three defenses per year. With preparation and follow up,
each defense is likely an hour or so of work for the faculty members
on the panel. That doesn't seem like an excessive burden. Of course,
I have left off the advising time associated with helping students
prepare their essays and defenses.  Depending on the student, that could
be significantly more.</p>

<p>Of course, we also have to consider the implications if a student does
not pass their defense. I expect that we might see some boards ask students
to revise insufficiently analyzed curricula and perhaps even to change
their plan for the senior year.</p>

<p>The benefits of such a system seem quite tangible to me.  Students will
reflect more carefully on the purposes, components, and structure of a
liberal arts education. Faculty will talk more frequently to each other
about what they see as essential.  Particularly as Grinnell ponders
liberal arts for the twenty-first century, such a requirement could
significantly impact out discussions.</p>

<p>I also think it would be an interesting exercise to hand a stack of those
essays to our accreditors.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although Grinnell does not have general education requirements, we find
that we are <em>more</em> successful in helping students develop strong and
individualized educational programs in the liberal arts.  As you will
see from this random sampling of required essays on the subject, our
students approach the design of their curricula with care and thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd guess that the bean counters wouldn't like it.  But I think it's
still worth considering.</p>

<p>What's the next step for this pipe dream?  I wonder whether I could
convince my department to participate in an experiment in which we require
every student who majors in CS to follow that process.  We'd also need
to find a few faculty members from other departments who would serve as
a review panel.  I wonder if any other departments would partner with
us on the experiment?  That might be a good innovation fund proposal.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference1" id="referent1">1</a>] I discussed course tags in <a href="course-tags-2017-09-09">a prior musing</a>.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference2" id="referent2">2</a>] As I've said before, I find it strange to group all Humanities
majors together.  The experiences of the foreign language students
are different than the experiences of the arts students (Studio Art,
Music, and Theatre/Dance) are different than the experiences of the other
Humanities students (Philosophy, Religious Studies, Classics, Art History,
and English).  I also find it strange to group the majors in the Science
division that emphasize the scientific method (e.g., Biology, Biological
Chemistry, Chemistry, Physics, and Psychology) with the majors that
do not (e.g., Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics).  Still,
the conglomerating of Humanities departments troubles me more.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference3" id="referent3">3</a>] <a href="elaine-marzluff">Elaine Marzluff</a> and <a href="erik-simpson">Erik Simpson</a>
stand out in particular, but also many others.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference4" id="referent4">4</a>] Arguably, it's also not what some branches of mathematics are
about, either.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference5" id="referent5">5</a>] We didn't think writing code should count, just as we don't
think programming languages should count as foreign languages, even
though they are foreign to most humans.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference6" id="referent6">6</a>] Yes, the implied air quotes are intentional.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference7" id="referent7">7</a>] I was going to write "information" rather than data.  Although
the data have been processed, I'm not sure that they've quite reached
the level that I'd want to call them "information".</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference8" id="referent8">8</a>] Division-level tagging is even more reductive.  That's why the tags
appear to split Humanities into four groups (Interpretation, Creative
Expression, Foreign Language, and Critical Reading) and Science into
two (Quantitative Reasoning and Scientific Method/Analysis).</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference9" id="referent9">9</a>] By "substantive" I mean about one page.  The 200 words we currently
require do not permit substantive argument.  They barely allow a
student to define what they mean by "liberal arts education" [<a href="#referent10" id="reference10">10</a>].</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference10" id="referent10">10</a>] I am happy to accept that there are multiple models and definitions.
I would hope that most students develop a personal definition [<a href="#referent11" id="reference11">11</a>] as they
develop their curriculum.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference11" id="referent11">11</a>] Grounded in the literature, of course.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference12" id="referent12">12</a>] Or perhaps penultimate semester.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference14" id="referent14">14</a>] I was going to suggest one faculty member from each division. However,
since I find our divisional boundaries arbitrary for other purposes,
I should not apply them here.</p>

<p>[<a href="#reference15" id="referent15">15</a>] The Grinnell Style Guide suggests that we spell it "adviser".  I
prefer this spelling.  Since official systems at Grinnell use the
"advisor" spelling, I feel comfortable doing so, too.</p>

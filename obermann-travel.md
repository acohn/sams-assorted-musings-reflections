Traveling to the Obermann center
================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), Obermann, short*

Not used to a commute.  It's about a ten minute walk from my front door
to my office.

It's usually about an hour from the front door of our house to exit 244,
the exit for Iowa City.

Unfortunately, there's construction between that exit and Iowa City and
the traffic decisions they've made clearly slow things down.  (In particular,
because they allow a left turn at the bridge for those going north, the
light has to alternate between southbound traffic, northbound traffic,
and bridge traffic.  If it were me, I'd disallow left turns onto the
bridge for northbound traffic and allow both southbound and northbound
traffic to flow simultaneously.)  So it's another fifteen or so minutes
from the exit to parking.  

One of the folks at the Center suggested that I take a geographically
longer path that should be temporally shorter.  (Check that one on
Tuesday.)

What about parking?  Fellows aren't supposed to use the very small parking 
lot at the Obermann Center.  There's a fairly steep charge for using the
UIowa parking structures.  Fortunately, the Obermann Center is on
the outskirts of campus, so I've been parking in the nearby neighborhood.
If I get in before 8 a.m., I can usually find parking about three and a
half blocks from the Center.  By 8:15 a.m., it's about two blocks more. 
I've managed to avoid getting here any later than that.

Like many Iowa neighborhoods, the area around the Obermann center does
not really have wide enough streets to accommodate parking on both sides.
Hence, they have alternate-side parking during the day [1].  In Grinnell,
alternate-side parking is one side (West) on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday Friday
and the other side on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.  In Iowa City,
alternate-side parking is one side on Even Days and one side on Odd Days.
Although the number of parked cars on one side generally suggest which
side is appropriate, I've found myself regularly asking myself for the
date.

During the trip, I generally listen to NPR.  I enjoy Morning Edition
in the morning and All Things Considered in the afteroon [2].

Of course, weather in Iowa does not always cooperate.  I've drive through
way too many rainstorms recently.

[1] Hmmm ... If it's only during the day, perhaps the streets *are*
wide enough to accommodate parking on both sides.  Rather, the rule
exists to ensure that people don't leave their cars parked for more
than a day.

[2] "Enjoy" may be the wrong term, at least at present.  I find it
frustrating to hear about modern American politics.  But it's important
to stay up to date.  Perhaps "appreciate" is the right term.

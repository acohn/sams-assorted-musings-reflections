Traveling to the Obermann center
================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), Obermann, short*

This fall, I'm doing something that many working people do, but that
I've generally avoided: I'm doing a long commute to work.  One of the
nice things about working in Grinnell is that it's about a ten-minute
walk from the front door of my house to my office and it's perhaps five
minutes if I decide to drive so that I have my car on campus [1].  Now,
my commute is much longer: It's usually about an hour from the front
door of our house to exit 244, the exit for Iowa City.

Unfortunately, there's construction between that exit and Iowa City and
the traffic decisions they've made slow things down.  (In particular,
because they allow a left turn at the bridge for those going north, the
light has to alternate between southbound traffic, northbound traffic,
and bridge traffic.  If it were me, I'd disallow left turns onto the
bridge for northbound traffic and allow both southbound and northbound
traffic to flow simultaneously.)  So it's another fifteen or so minutes
from the exit to parking, perhaps better on some days.  

One of the folks at the Center suggested that I take a geographically
longer path that should be temporally shorter.  My experience is that 
while the longer route has less traffic, the total time ends up being
about the same.

What about parking?  Fellows aren't supposed to use the very small parking 
lot at the Obermann Center.  There's a fairly steep charge for using the
UIowa parking structures [2].  Fortunately, the Obermann Center is on
the outskirts of campus, so I've been parking in the nearby neighborhood.
If I get in before 8 a.m., I can usually find parking about two-and-a-half
or three-and-a-half blocks from the Center.  By 8:15 a.m., it's about
two blocks more.  I've managed to avoid getting here any later than that [3].
In any case, I park about the same distance from my Obermann office that I
live from my home office.

Like many Iowa neighborhoods, the area around the Obermann center
does not have broad enough streets to accommodate parking on both sides.
Hence, they have alternate-side parking during the day [4].  In Grinnell,
alternate-side parking is one side (West) on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday
Friday and the other side on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.  In Iowa
City, alternate-side parking is one side on Even Days and one side on
Odd Days.  Although the number of parked cars on one side generally
suggest which side is appropriate, I've found myself regularly asking
myself for the date.

During the trip, I generally listen to NPR.  I enjoy Morning Edition
in the morning and All Things Considered in the afternoon.  Well,
"enjoy" may be the wrong term given the current political climate.  But
I appreciate the opportunity to keep up with the news.

Of course, the weather in Iowa does not always cooperate.  I've driven
through way too many rainstorms recently.  I'm hoping that I don't have
to drive through too much snow.  It's Iowa, how much will it snow before
the end of the semester? [5]

I love my office at Obermann.  There are no distractions.  If I turn
off my email, and I often do, I can work much more productively than
when I work at home or at my Grinnell office.  But commuting?  That's
something I'd prefer to give up.  I'm glad to spend a semester with this
commute, but I'm glad that I ended up with a job that gives me a much
shorter commute.  Grinnell requires some compromises, but having the 
short commute makes up for many of them.

Postscript: "Traveling" is only one letter removed from "raveling"
which means the same thing as "unraveling".  I mention this only because
I spent way too much time working on writing a Web development
environment I called "Web Raveler"

[1] I accept that driving to campus is not always responsible.  But there are
times that I need to be prepared to leave campus quickly (e.g., if I'm
planning to attend a high-school event or if I have to pick up groceries
for the department or division).  And there are times that I'm bringing
too much to campus to carry it by hand.

[2] I believe it's well established that I'm a cheapskate.  And I'm
a cheapskate even though I can likely use some of my Obermann funds
to pay for the parking.  I'd rather use them for, say, books.

[3] Yes, that does mean that I have to plan to leave home before 7 a.m.
each day.  I cope.

[4] Hmmm ... If it's only during the day, perhaps the streets *are*
wide enough to accommodate parking on both sides.  Rather, the rule
exists to ensure that people don't leave their cars parked for more
than a day.

[5] I probably shouldn't ask.  It snowed six or so inches on October
31 during my first year at Grinnell.

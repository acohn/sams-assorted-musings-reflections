Inbox zero, revisited, stage one
================================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email), long, rambly*

*Disclaimer: This musing was written in fits and starts.  That is, I'd
start working on the issue, then get distracted for a few days [1], and
have to go back to and update information or start again.*

About a year and a half ago, I spent about a week of winter break trying
to achieve "[inbox zero](inbox-zero-01)".  I get a lot of email, not
all of which is easy to deal with, and not all of which I can deal with
at the same time.  So it accumulates In any case, I failed.  I think
I've declared inbox bankruptcy twice, once [at the end of that series
of musings](inbox-zero-08) and once again in April 2017.

I *try* to file my email.  For example, I set aside over three hundred
messages pertaining to SIGCSE 2018 in the last few months of 2017.
Most have to do with my role as one of the three Student Volunteers
Coordinators, but there are also some having to do with my papers, with
student travel, and other topics.  I don't even want to think about how
many email messages pertain to the classes I teach.

In any case, as of 24 June 2018, I have 40,000+ messages in my inbox,
of which slightly less than half are unread.  The last time I recorded
numbers was on 12 January 2018, when I had 26,000+ messages in my inbox
[2]. Let's see ... I accumulated 26,000 messages in 260 days and another
14,000 messages in 163 days.  That means I have slightly less than 100
messages each day that I didn't get around to filing and almost 50 that
I didn't get around to reading.  Since I think I deal with the majority
of my messages each day, that's kind of scary.  If I spent one minute
on each message, I would need to spend nearly two more hours each day
dealing with email.  Yech.

And the "one minute" may be optimistic.  For example, in dealing with
incoming emails, I had one message in which a asked to subscribe to the
department mailing list (1 minute to add) and about funding for GHC (5
minutes to write) and a submission to the SIGCSE mailing list that I had
to reject and then send a message explaining the rejection (3 minutes).
On the other hand, there are messages that I could skim and delete in
about fifteen seconds.

Anyway, let's see how I can do on a quick cleanup.  We'll start with the
obvious mailing lists (e.g., Council on Undergraduate Research), news
feeds (e.g., Chronicle, Salon.com, the Washington Post), newsletters,
and advertisements (e.g., Amazon), and the rest.  Or maybe it's better to
just put the email in order by sender and skim through for easy-to-delete
groups of senders.  [Sam spends some time working on this and then gets
distracted by other tasks.]

**Working on `rebelsky@gmail.com`**

It's also likely that I should deal with things slightly differently 
depending on the account.  Most of my mail goes to my `@grinnell.edu`
address.  However, I send some to my `@gmail.com` address, mostly stuff
that I can't stand being urldefended, particularly the racket-users mailing
list, the RISKS mailing list [3], and any messages related to my work as
SIGCSE information director.

For the racket-users mailing list, I have 621 messages still in my inbox.
I know that there's an archive somewhere out there, so I could just delete
them all.  I like to keep the most relevant messages to make them easier
to find.  For example, there was a recent discussion of using Racket for
Digital Humanities.  But I'm not in the mood for filtering.  Delete 'em
all or create a "Racket Bankruptcy" folder?  I think the latter.

It appears that I handle the RISKS digest as it comes in.  That's a 
comfort.

What about my infodir messages?  Oooh!  There are 901 of them.  Most are
error reports.  Those don't always come in at convenient times.  And I'm
less aggressive at handling them than I used to be.  Sometimes I keep them
to see if there's a pattern to the "too many loops" or "temporarily
unavailable messages".  I can do without those.  What else do we have?
A bunch of "Approval Required" messages that I forgot to delete.  But I
handle those promptly, either approving or rejecting.  One outstanding
subscription request from a day or two ago that neither my co-director
nor I got around to handling yet [4,5].  Watching the mailbox get gradually
smaller as the messages get deleted is fun.  

Now I'm down to 381 messages in my Gmail mailbox, only 208 of which are
unread.  It appears that I do a slightly worse job of reading my Gmail
messages than those in my primary CS mailbox.  What's left that's easy
to delete?

Oh, look!  I have 173 digests from the SIGCSE mailing list itself in my
Gmail mailbox [6].  Those are easy to remove.

There appear to be a bunch of infodir messages remaining; I think those are
cases in which people replied to me, rather than to the infodir mailing
address [7].  I'm not going to count them since they are interspersed
with other messages that I'm handling one or a few at a time.

There are a bunch of messages generated by various Google services, such
as when one of my research students adds or modifies a collaborative
document [8].  Those are easy to delete.

I needed to process the remaining messages manually.  That was relatively
easy and relatively straightforward.  A bunch needed to get filed in the
"Family" folder.  Some could be get deleted.  And there were a few
professional messages that I needed to keep.

Woo!  *Inbox zero achieved!* (if only for one of my inboxes).

**Other mailboxes**

I generally track seven inboxes: `rebelsky@grinnell.edu`, `rebelsky@gmail.com`,
two accounts that got associated with CSC 321 and CSC 322 that I use for 
some subscriptions (e.g., Cloud 9), my iCloud account [9], my Global Online
Academy Account [10], and the grader account for CSC 151.

I'm leaving `rebelsky@grinnell.edu` for last; that's the big one.  I've
just finished `rebelsky@gmail.com`.  So that's five "small" accounts to
look at.

The first CSC 322 account only has messages from Team Twilio [11].
I can delete them.  *Inbox zero!*.  The second CSC 322 account only has
AWS messages.  I can delete them.  *Inbox zero!*

My iCloud account has only one message, a reminder from Apple that I
now use two-factor authentication [12].  *Inbox zero!*  My GOA account 
only has some reviews of messages from the Slack channel.  *Inbox zero!*

What about the CSC 151 grader account?  My graders are pretty good at
reading and responding to messages.  So there are only about a dozen
assorted messages that didn't get handled or deleted, mostly ones that
I replied to.  *Inbox zero!*

Of course, two Gmail messages came in while I was scanning the smaller
inboxes.  I managed to get those dealt with fairly quickly.

**Back to the main mailbox**

With the initial work on the main mailbox and the work on the subsidiary
messages, I'm now down to 32,675 messages in my inbox, of which 14,621
are unread [14].  One of the most recent messages is a request from a
student to review work.  I suppose it would be impolite to say "It's summer;
I don't get paid for normal work in the summer and the College has warned
me about doing work other than what I'm paid for [15]."  It's also not
how I feel.  But I'm not in the mood for reviewing student work over the
weekend.  So I add it to my "to do" list [16] and move it to my 
"___To Do" mailbox.

On to the more serious work.  Let's order the messages by sender and then
for the senders that represent large chunks, typically mailing lists and
advertisements.  Of course, ordering them by sender puts my messages from
Simon at the top of the list [17].  One of them was about a paper he had
co-authored on expectations of academic honesty in the CS classroom.  So
I sent a message to the department to suggest that we read it together.
And that's illustrative of one of the reasons I never get through my
mailbox.  Unfortunately (or, perhaps, fortunately), there are a lot of
messages that fall in the "I should read this and think about it" category.
I need to skip over those if I"m going to make a real dent in my inbox.
But those kinds of messages keep cropping up.  A message about a new
service called "Rebble" that will support Pebble users.  The sad message
about the end of Cr8Iowa, the Iowa Destination Imagination organization.

What about the messages to SIGCSE-members?  Let's see ... there are nearly
1000 messages to SIGCSE-members.  I'm not going to look through them now.
But I know I saved some intentionally.  They get their very own "SIGSE
Inbox Bankruptcy" folder [18].

How many messages are from me?  (I like to carbon-copy myself rather
than rely on the "sent" messages folder.  I'm not sure that's the
best idea.)  Wow.  2000 or so.  Oh well, those definitely go into some
long-term storage.

A frustrating part of cleaning out the mailbox is that in the midst
of large swaths of email that are easy to delete are a variety of messages
that I'm kicking myself for missing.  "How often will you be in your
office for your fellowship?"  _Daily.  But I can share the office_
"Are you really skipping the AP grading?"  _Yup.  I went on a cruise
with my wife instead._  "Can my daughter meet with you when we visit
Grinnell in late May?"  _Um, not anymore.  I'm sorry._  It's things like
those that convince me that I really need to strive for inbox zero.  I
just don't know how to manage it when things get busy.  I've started
clicking a lot more "unsubscribe" links [19].

Another frustrating part is that Mail.app and the Exchange server don't
always get along well.  That means that there are groups of messages that
I'd swear I had to delete twice.  For example, I'd delete all the random
eBay email.  An hour later, I'd get back to the "e" section and see more
email from eBay.  And no, it was not new email.

Okay, I've now spent over five hours [20] cleaning out the out the
mailbox [21].  I'm down to 11,379 messages in the inbox, of which 1,286
are unread.  It's time to declare **inbox bankruptcy**.  I realize
that for some people, that means deleting everything in the inbox.
I'm a pack rat and I can't bear to do that.  So I'll just create a folder
[22] and move the remaining messages there.

Or maybe I won't.  It gave up midway through.  The messages aren't in the
new folder.  They aren't in my inbox.  Where did they go?  Did I mention
that (a) I hate computers and (b) I hate the 

And we are once again left with the questions of whether I can maintain
inbox zero once I start with inbox zero [23] and whether I'll ever get to the
mail that I've put to the side [24].

---

[1] Or weeks, or months.

[2] Once again, about half were unread.

[3] Trying to read a URL-defended text-only mailing list that has lots
and lots of links is incredibly painful.

[4] Subscription requests invariably require checking the slow ACM
membership database and some other things.  So although I try to handle
them when they arrive, I don't always manage to do so.  Keeping those
higher on the agenda is one of the reasons I'm working toward inbox zero.

[5] More detail about my job as SIGCSE information director will appear
in a future musing.

[6] I use my `rebelsky@grinnell.edu` mailbox for the message-at-a-time
version of the mailing list and `rebelsky@gmail.com` for the digest version.
Getting it in both forms helps me monitor the list.

[7] These days, I try to make sure that every outgoing message relating
to the infodir position has a "reply-to" field set to `infodir@sigcse.org`.
But I don't always remember and it's only a relatively recent practice.

[8] I don't get a message each time that happens.  Nonetheless, I do get 
messages some of the time it happens.

[9] I almost never use my iCloud account.  But it exists.  So I should
keep track of the email.

[10] I rarely receive email on my GOA account.  But it exists so I
should track it.  And I remain hopeful that I will find a way to teach
for GOA again.

[11] Twilio is an awesome service to support programs that send and
receive text messages.  One of the original CSC 322 projects used it.

[12] I always find it humorous when I connect to iCloud from a Web
browser, it says "Unrecognized browser", but then pops up a message
on the screen of the same device.  I realize that they're not connected,
but it's funny.

[14] For those concerned about the unread messages, the vast majority
are advertisements.  Some are messages that I'm pretty sure that I read,
but, for some reason, the mail reader didn't mark.

[15] It's true.  At the meeting where we discussed the new policy that
"You can only receive external funding for 2.5 months of summer work,
even though you have a nine-month contract", they were very clear that
we shouldn't be doing anything else during the months we received 
external funding.  As you can guess, that strikes me as an incredibly
narrow-minded policy.  And I realize that it's not the College's policy;
it's typical a funder policy.  But if you're paying me for full-time
work over the summer, and I'm spending forty hours per week on your project,
I should feel free to do other kinds of things in the remaining time.

[16] Yes, Doug, I'm using todoist.

[17] Simon is a computer scientist active in the SIGCSE community.  I
enjoy corresponding with him.  He's polite about my tendency to 
procrastinate.  And we both have the experience of doing behind-the-scenes
support.  He also does cool research.  Because he only has one name
and most software assumes both a forename and a surname, he presents
interesting challenges, including, it seems, to his email package.
Email from Simon shows up in my alphabetical list at the top because it
considers him ".. Simon".

[18] You can tell I'm a pack rat, can't you?

[19] A surprisingly large number of democratic candidates automatically
put me on their mailing lists, or at least their fundraising mail lists.
It frustrates me no end.  But those aren't the only things from which
I'm unsubscribing.

[20] Probably much more than five hours.  I started at about 9:00 a.m.
this morning.  (And I'd done things on previous days.)  It's currently
8:30 p.m.  There were some breaks for other activities, but fewer than
I would have liked.

[21] Also musing about cleaning out the mailbox.

[22] "\_\_Inbox Bankruptcy 2018-06-30", to be precise.

[23] Maybe for a little while, but not for long.  I'll try to muse about
the size of my inbox once a week as a way to incentivize myself to stay
on top of it.

[24] Let's see ... Next week is prep for two weeks of code camp.  Then
we have a week of code camp.  Then a week to finish developing a completely
new curriculum.  Then the last week of code camp.  Nope; I'm never getting
to any outstanding messages.

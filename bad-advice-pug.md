Bad advice
==========

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), academia*

One of the more interesting [1] things to happen in academia during
the past year was Purdue University's acquisition of Kaplan University.
Purdue is a public, state, brick-and-mortar university.  Kaplan was a
private, online university.  It seems like an odd match.  But Purdue
insists that it supports their mission.  In any case, the acquisition
led to the creation of Purdue University Global.

Today, the Higher Ed newspapers are abuzz with the newly released
[Purdue University Global Confidentiality and Restriction Agreement](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/PG%20Confidentiality%20and%20Restriction%20Agreement%20-%20Non-CA%20%2804-2018%29%20v2.pdf).  For example, you can read about it
in
[_Chronicle_](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Gag-Clause-at-Purdue/244340)
and [_Inside Higher
Ed_](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/08/23/aaup-purdue-global-gets-decide-who-owns-faculty-work).
The [American Association of University
Professors](https://www.aaup.org) has also released [a
statement](https://www.aaup.org/media-release/purdue-global-nondisclosure-agreement-runs-roughshod-over-faculty-rights#.W372Un588qI),
which may have been what prompted the news articles.

The agreement has a variety of characteristics that many people [2]
find problematic.  It appears that PUG [3] claims ownership of all the
educational materials faculty create [4].  The agreement appears to
place some fairly severe restrictions on what one can say about PUG or
the work they do at PUG [5].  Here's how they describe their confidential
information.

> When we say “Purdue Global Confidential Information,” we mean any
non-public information about Purdue Global you may receive, including,
without limitation, Purdue Global's trade secret information, course
materials, methods of instruction, research reports, marketing programs,
vendors, customers, products, services, employees, finances, costs,
expenses, financial or competitive condition, policies, and practices,
computer software programs and programming tools and their respective
design, architecture, modules, interfaces, databases and database
structures, non-literal elements, capabilities and functionality,
source code and object code, research and development efforts, marketing
and distribution efforts, licensing, cross-licensing, marketing and
distribution practices, computer software programs and other information
licensed or otherwise, and any other non-public information that does
or may have economic value. [6]

While it seems reasonable to limit the disclosure of some of these things,
academia traditionally allows faculty to discuss their course materials
and methods of instruction.  It also allows them to criticize publicly
issues of structure, administration, and even partners.  For example, if
Grinnell were to contract with a software vendor I knew to be unethical
or a security risk, I would have the right to complain about it in a
public forum [7].

Beyond the issues of intellectual property and limits to speech, there's
also a non-compete clause, more typical of a business than an institution
of higher education.  While the non-compete clause doesn't prevent
someone from taking a job at another institution of higher education,
it does restrict their ability to suggest that others also join that
other institution.  That restriction applies to both "employees" (most
of whom I would call "teachers") and to "customers" (most of whom I
would call "students").  It's likely that some non-trivial percentage of
PUG teachers will be adjuncts, and adjuncts commonly share opportunities
with each other.  Also, since online students are less likely to affiliate
with a particular institution, it seems natural for a teacher to say
"By the way, I'll be teaching an online course on Coursera next semester.
Check it out"  Neither action appears to be allowed under this clause.

While I find all of these issues of real concern, I did not intend them
to be the focus of this piece [8].  Rather, I want to comment on some
quotations that appear in the _Chronicle_ piece.

> "It's never been a problem," said [former president of the
Kaplan Faculty Senate, Robert] Winters of the policy, citing his
own experiences. He said he'd discussed his teaching methods with
outsiders and "I've never had anybody at the university tell me that
I shouldn't." [...]  Winters said he also didn't share the concern
over the noncompete clause. Even for faculty members who leave and go
teach elsewhere a week later, he said, "I've never heard of it being
enforced."

That's bad advice [9], particularly from the president of the faculty
senate.  Just because an institution [10] has not enforced the policies in
the past, there's no guarantee that they won't enforce them in the future.
A contract is a contract.  I would not expect "They didn't enforce this
clause last year" to carry much weight in a court of law.  We're certainly
seeing a lot of instances this year of people who are prosecuted for
acts that were "common practice" [11].  But I am not a lawyer.

So I consider the advice bad.  What makes it especially bad is that
Winters can't even add traditional IANAL [12] disclaimer because he is
"[a] lawyer by training who teaches in the Purdue Global public-safety
program".  What lawyer gives such advice?

Once again, I'm glad I'm at Grinnell.

Postscript: My concerns about legal-ese are not new.  I remember when the
school district first rolled out its laptop program and I refused
to sign the agreement because it claimed ownership of all IP created
on the laptop.  While I don't think that the school district intended
to claim the kids' IP, and they told me that "It's just boilerplate",
I wanted it clear that my children owned anything they created.  I did
eventually get that text removed, but I still read the policy carefully
each year [14].

Postscript: I almost forgot to mention the following.  When I received
my first contract from Grinnell, and it indicated that the _Faculty
Handbook_ was implicitly part of the contract, I requested a copy of the
_Handbook_ and skimmed through it before I signed.  All that I recall
is that I was impressed by the detail with which the _Handbook_ attends
to shared appointments.

[1] And controversial

[2] Including me.

[3] My abbreviation for Purdue University Global.  I don't think they
use it.

[4] The _Inside Higher Ed_ piece focuses on that characteristic in its
title, "[Who Owns Faculty Work At Purdue Global?](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/08/23/aaup-purdue-global-gets-decide-who-owns-faculty-work)".

[5] The _Chronicle of Higher Education_ piece focuses on that characteristic
in its title, "['Gag Clause' at Purdue Global Raises Alarms About Faculty Rights](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Gag-Clause-at-Purdue/244340)".

[6] Purdue University Global. n.d. "Confidentiality and Restriction Agreement".
Found online at <https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/PG%20Confidentiality%20and%20Restriction%20Agreement%20-%20Non-CA%20%2804-2018%29%20v2.pdf>.

[7] Note that I would not normally start with a complaint in a public
forum.  I would start by contacting [CIO Robinson](dave-robinson),
Dean Latham, or Registrar Maher.  Only after that had failed would I
raise public concerns.

[8] More accurately, they were not supposed to have been the focus of this
piece.

[9] Okay, it's not direct advice.  But he's suggesting that people should
not worry about the requirements of the contract.  And that's effectively
advice.

[10] Or, more precisely, a previous institution.

[11] E.g., failure to disclose that you have acted as an agent of another
country.

[12] I am not a lawyer.

[14] When we got paper copies of the agreements to sign, I would cross
off anything that seemed inappropriate and insert other text.  Since the
school district always issued laptops to my kids, I assumed they accepted
the amendments.

Another month of (almost) daily musings
=======================================

*Topics/tags: [End-of-month musings](index-monthly), short*

You may be puzzled by the second tag in today's musing.  Typically,
my end-of-month musings [1] are long and rambly.  But it doesn't feel
like this one will be that way.  This month has been a difficult one.
When weekends come [3], I'm not generally up for musing.  I've missed a
bunch of Friday and Saturday nights and even a few Sunday nights.
I've made up for it once in a while by writing [4] two musings.  In part,
it's that other forms of writing [5] are using up most of my writing
energy.  In part, it's that I've been fiddling with enough computer
issues that doing one more thing on the computer seems hard.  

It's not that I don't have things to muse about; I do.  For example,
over the past few days, I've accumulated plans to write about a show
by The Association [6], a reading by Michael Perry, and Gene Doucette's
_The Spaceship Next Door_.  Perhaps I'll get to those over the next few
days.  And Wednesday [7] will almost certainly involve reflections about my
second Obermann seminar.  At least I hope it will.

Let's just [8] call it a month in which my muse and I both struggled.
Let's hope that next month goes better.

Postscript: Just because I'll forget if I don't record it here: I've
changed the terms I use in my posts to Twitter and Facebook.  Instead
of "Musing of the day #764" [9], I now use "Daily musing #764".  I had
some reason for making that change, but I can't remember what it was.

[1] Or, once in a while [2], first-day-of-next-month musings.

[2] Like today.

[3] And some weeknights.

[4] Or completing.

[5] Reviews, administrative documents, FunDHum, etc.

[6] Is "Cherish" as creepy as "Happy Together"?

[7] Or, more likely, Thursday.

[8] Dear Grammarly: I understand that "The phrase *just* may weaken [my]
message".  I'm leaving it there.

[9] Or whatever number.

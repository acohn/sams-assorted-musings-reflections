Losing (and gaining) weight
===========================

I'm fat.  I've been fat as long as I can remember.  Pictures of me
as a two-year-old show a chubby little boy.  But the meaning of "fat"
when applied to me has changed over the years.  I've gone from chubby to
overweight to morbidly obese.  A number of things contribute to my weight.
I "stress eat".  I tend to overeat [1].  I don't exercise enough.
And these characteristics tend to spiral: If I'm heavier, it's harder
to exercise.  If I don't exercise, I don't generate enough of those
chemicals that help reduce stress [2], I'm more stressed, and I eat more.
I'm also stressed about my weight.  And, unfortunately, even that kind
of stress can make me eat more, or at make bad eating choices, or both.

About the time I turned 48 (almost six years ago), I decided to make a
significant change.  My father had tied before his 49th birthday because
of his primary health problem (his addiction to unfiltered Lucky Strikes
led to small cell cancer) and I did not want to do the same thing to my
kids.  So I went on a serious diet.  I primarily ate weight-loss foods
[3] and severely restricted calories.  By the time I hit the age at
which my father had died, I was down 100 pounds, which put me at about
the weight at which I had arrived at Grinnell.  That weight was still
heavier than I wanted to be, but it was clearly *much* better.

And then I went off of the weight-loss foods.  My weight slowly crept
upwards until it reached thirty pounds more than my low.  And there I
stayed.  I think i cycled around that weight for about a year.  At that
point, I had a lot of now-reduced stomach that hung down rather than out.
And so I decided to get a Panniculectomy.  I had thought that getting
rid of the excess skin (pannus) would make me feel better about myself
and my doctor suggested that getting rid of the under-fed fat cells
would also help.

Getting the Panniculectormy ended up being a less-than-good idea.  We
did not account for "physician partner syndrome", an observation that
the partners of physicians tend to experience unexpected complications.
I'm told that I almost died during recovery.  My post-operation health
during winter holiday season caused untold stress on my family.  I lost
feeling in my stomach.  And my body's signalling is still broken.

Over the next few years, my weight crept upward and upward.  In 2017,
amidst the stresses of running an under-resourced department and then
teaching it jumped back up to my pre-weight-loss weight.  Everything
felt like it was for naught.  But I really had to be as huge as I am.
And I still worry about being around for my family.  So I'm back on
the weight-loss trail.  I know it is harder to lose weight the second
time around.  But I'm trying This time, I'm relying more on developing
good habits (e.g., no second portions, no stress eating at 11pm when
I'm still up working, more home-cooked foods) than on special foods.
I hope that will make a longer-term difference.

As of today, I am N pounds off of my high weight of November 2017 and I
weight the least I have weighed since DATE.  I still need to fit more 
exercise into my life, even though Michelle tells me that exercise has
little effect on weight loss.  I'm feeling a bit better about myself.

My long-term questions are whether I can reach a pre-Grinnell weight
and whether I can keep the weight off over a longer period.  I think I
just need to do two or three things: focus on maintaining good habits;
regularly remind myself of the tradeoffs between the joy of eating (a
momentary pleasure) and the pleasure of being lighter or the displeasure
of being heavier; and find ways to reduce my stress levels.

We shall see how it goes.

[1] At some point, my body's "You are full" signalling clearly broke.  I
can still identify points at which I know that I am physically full but my
body is sending me "you are hungry messages".

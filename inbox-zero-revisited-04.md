Inbox zero, revisited, stage four
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email), rambly, disjoint*

When I [left off on my Sisyphean task to stay at inbox
zero](inbox-zero-revisited-03), I had 440 messages left in my inbox, 261
of which were unread.  Upon reading that, Michelle said something like,
"Having 261 unread messages in my inbox would make me feel overwhelmed."
If I recall correctly, I replied, "Yup, I feel both overwhelmed and anxious
about my inbox."  I didn't say, "It's worse now that I've unsubscribed
to a lot of email lists because I know most of it is email that actually
needs real consideration."  Perhaps I should have.

I'm finding it amazingly hard to keep up with my email in real time.
Even trying to keep up with the mail, by noon on Thursday [1], I was up
to 510 messages, 305 of which were unread.  By Saturday night at 6:30
p.m., I had about 600 messages in my inbox, 336 of which were unread.
I should probably just set aside enough time a day to look at it.
Keeping up with the email has negatively affected my other work [2].
I should also consider turning it off when I want to do other work.

I can make things a bit better by unsubscribing from more lists.
Let's see.  *New England Mobile Book Fair*.  I worked there in high
school.  I have fond memories.  But, well, it's no longer owned by
the same people and, given how infrequently I make it out east, I'm
unlikely to visit.  *Paperworks*.  I don't get much mail from them,
but I'm trying to be thorough.  *Berklee Performance Center*.  I'm not
quite sure why I'm on their mailing list.  It's another infrequent one.
*The Oxford American*.  It's something that's interesting, but I
don't have enough time to read it.  *Cardhaus Games*.  Another in a
long line of game subscriptions.  I thought I'd unsubscribed already.
*Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art*.  I don't visit the area as much as I
used to.  I don't need their newsletter.  *American Airlines*.  I'm an
AAdvantage member.  I just wanted my monthly summary, but I'm getting a
lot more.  My first attempt to unsubscribe required a password.  But my
second try seems to have succeeded.

So, what else did I deal with along the way?  Some email that's easy
to delete, such as the daily email from ITS that it's almost time
to reset my password [3].  There were some messages that required a few
minutes to think about or react to.

But there were also a lot of real tasks to consider.  Here are some that
I considered during the week.  *A request to review volunteer management
software in my role as one of the coordinators of SIGCSE volunteers*.
That's something to add to my to-do list.  I also sent a note to my
co-coordinators telling them that I would get to it as soon as I could.
*Some issues relating to policies on SIGCSE-members*.  That was smaller
and something that seemed more urgent.  I sent some notes to the SIGCSE
board.  *A message on the Racket mailing list about a cool approach to
board game playing with PLT Redex.  That seems worth understanding more
about.  Add to my to-do list [4].  *ACM news about new Code of Ethics.*
That's something I need to read and think about it.  Add to my to-do list.
*A request from a colleague to consult on a programming project.*   I
sent them a quick response to ask them to wait until after the next code
camp.  Of course, that resulted in a bunch of back-and-forth messages.
I also ended up doing a little looking into the issue they raised.
*Belated administrivia from my fall fellowship.*  Did I mention that I
knew these were outstanding?  Anyway, I felt guilty about the delay, so
I responded to five or so different messages [5].  Some of the messages
made me wonder whether I'll fit in; it's clearly a place for humanists.
*A request from alum to come back to campus and recruit.* Yeah,
that's relatively urgent.  I dug up a bit of information and sent a
few followup messages.   And that's all from just trying to keep up [8]
during the week.

What about Saturday night, when I decided to try to make more progress
through the messages?  Let's see ... _A quick introduction to GitOps_.
Yeah, another thing on the "to read" list.  _A message from a friend
who is visiting in early August_.  That's something I need to reply
to now.  _An article about rsync_.  I don't really need to read it, but
I should remember it for reference.  I need a better reference
manager.  _A question from a student about conference funding_.
Reply with suggestions that they check out the professional
development fund from CLS.  _A note from the MIT press
about book proposals_.  Add to the to-do list under "things
to think about in a few weeks".  _A link to [an article about
the Senate putting forth a bill that treats program code as a foreign
language](https://www.languagemagazine.com/2018/07/12/senate-bill-counts-coding-for-language-requirement/).
That falls into "things I need to muse about immediately" [9].
_Some notes from Student Affairs._  Those I need to handle immediately.

Finally, there were a few fun things, too.  The Audities Digest included
a note on the origins of Shocking Blue's "Venus" and a [corresponding
link to a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uqnN3ek2vI).
I put "listen to that" on my things to do at the end of the night.  The
riff and the phrasing are clearly stolen.  But the lyrics to "Venus" are
new.  I'm not sure where that puts things.  Back then, it was most likely
considered okay to borrow a riff [10].  These days, in which one second
of a bass lick appears to be protected by IP, probably not.

Where do I stand after an hour or so working on the mailbox, which is
all that I'm up to this evening?  436 messages, of which 247 are unread.
In some sense, that's good progress.  I got through about 1/4 of the
messages.  And I added a bunch to my "to do" list.

Yeah, Michelle is right:  Dealing with the outstanding messages is
utterly overwhelming.  Sometimes, I'm not sure how I ever get anything
significant done.  And it's summer, when things are supposed to be
lighter.  What happens in the fall?  At least this fall I'll be 
on my fellowship.

My next goal: Finish cleaning out the mailbox on Sunday.  Or perhaps I
should deal with some of the outstanding tasks I just added.  And, well,
there's more preparation for the Code Camp left to do [11].  We shall see
what I can actually do.

---

[1] Noon Thursday was a day and a half after I had reached 440/261.  

[2] I suppose that I could say that my other work has negatively affected
my email reading, but that's getting things backwards.

[3] There's some pretty good evidence that forcing people to reset their
passwords every six months provides less added security because it means
that they have to write down their passwords somewhere.  Or at least I
recall reading that somewhere; I'm not sure where.

[4] Or at least my to-read list.

[5] Let's see ... an invitation to lunch with a question about allergies,
a question about what kind of computer I need,  a request for a W9 form [6],
a request for information to get me a Herkey card [7],  and a request for 
a signed acceptance letter.  It feels like I missed something.

[6] It's okay to send my SSN over email, right?

[7] They probably don't call it a Herkey card.

[8] And, perhaps, to cut down some of the past messages.

[9] I considered moving this musing another day into the future.  Instead,
after writing a draft of that musing, I pushed the final version to 
"when I have less time to muse", which is likely some night of
code camp.

[10] If borrowing a lick is not okay, Bo Diddly should be owed a 
significant amount of money.

[11] I spent somewhere between five and six hours on the code camp today,
which is a Saturday.  I'm glad to know that next week is the last of this
summer's code camps.

Inbox zero, revisited, stage four
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email)*

When I [left off on my Sisyphean task to stay at inbox
zero](inbox-zero-revisited-03), I had 440 messages left in my inbox, 261
of which were unread.  Upon reading that, Michelle said something like,
"Having 261 unread messages in my inbox would make me feel overwhelmed."
If I recall correctly, I replied "Yup, I feel both overwhelmed and anxious
about my inbox."  I didn't say "It's worse now that I've unsubscribed to
a lot of email lists because I know most of it is email that actually needs
real consideration."  Perhaps I should have.

Amazingly hard to keep up with my email in real time.  I should probably 
just set aside a time a day to look at it.  And I should consider turning
it off when I want to do other work.  But even trying to keep up with
the mail, I was up to 510/305 by noon on Thursday (a day and a half after
I had reached 440/261).  And keeping up with the email has negatively
affected my other work.  [I suppose that I could say that my other work
has negatively affected my email reading, but that's getting things
backwards.]

Unsubscribe: *New England Mobile Book Fair*.  I worked there in high school.
I have fond memories.  But, well, it's no longer owned by the same people
and, given how infrequently I make it out east, I'm unlikely to visit.
*Paperworks*.  I don't get much mail from them, but I'm tring to be
thorough.

More tasks to handle: *SIGCSE volunteers*.  Add to the to-do list.
*Policies on SIGCSE-members*.  Handle now.  Message on the Racket
mailing list about a icool approach to board game playing with PLT Redex.
Add to my to-do list [1].  *ACM news about new Code of Ethics*  I need to
read and think about it.  Add to to-do list.  Request from colleague to
consult on programming project.  Respond, ask them to wait until after
the next code camp.  Respond to a bunch of followup messages.  Belated
administrivia from my fall fellowship.  Feel guilty about the delay.
Respond to five or so different messages [2].  Wonder whether I'll fit in.
*Request from alum to come back and recruit*.  Dig up information, send
a few followup messages.

Yeah, Michelle is right.  It's utterly overwhelming.  Sometimes, I'm not
sure how I ever get anything significant done.  And it's summer.  What
happens in the fall?  Well, at least this fall I'll be on my fellowship.

[1] Or at least my to-read list.

[2] Let's see ... an invitation to lunch with a question about allergies,.  
a question about what kind of computer I need,  a request for a W9 form [3],
a request for information to get me a Herkey card [4],  and a request for 
a signed acceptance letter.  It feels like I missed something.

[3] It's okay to send my SSN over email, right?

[4] They probably don't call it a Herkey card.

Inbox zero, revisited, stage four
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Email](index-email)*

When I [left off on my Sisyphean task to stay at inbox
zero](inbox-zero-revisited-03), I had 440 messages left in my inbox, 261
of which were unread.  Upon reading that, Michelle said something like,
"Having 261 unread messages in my inbox would make me feel overwhelmed."
If I recall correctly, I replied "Yup, I feel both overwhelmed and anxious
about my inbox."  I didn't say "It's worse now that I've unsubscribed to
a lot of email lists because I know most of it is email that actually needs
real consideration."  Perhaps I should have.

More tasks to handle: SIGCSE volunteers.  To-do list.  Policies on 
SIGCSE-members.  Do now.

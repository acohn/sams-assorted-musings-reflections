Strunk & White and Williams
===========================

*Topics/tags: [Language](index-language), [teaching](index-teaching), short*

One of the regular columns in _Chronicle of Higher Education_ is titled
_Lingua Franca_ and is about "Language and writing in academe".  While I
don't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the old academic magazine of the
same name [1], I consider it one of my reading pleasures.

A recent column was about the 100th anniversary of Strunk (or Strunk &
White's) _The Elements of Style_.  You can tell the author's perspective
from the title of the column: "[Strunk at 100: A Centennial Not to
Celebrate](https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2018/06/20/strunk-at-100-a-centennial-not-to-celebrate/)".
While I would have read the column in any case, the associated blurb in
the daily _Chronicle_ digest caught my eye.

> Geoff Pullum argues that professors should stop sending students to
a thoroughly outdated writing guide — and cites some alternatives.

I entered the piece enthusiastic to hear his criticisms for Strunk & White
and, as importantly, to hear what books he recommended.  I wondered to myself,
"Will he recommend one of Joe Williams' texts?  If so, which one?"

I won't give away most of Pullum's criticisms; you should read the piece.
However, two comments are worth reporting.

> It is unforgivably lazy for instructors to continue directing 21st-century students to a text on the English language written by a man who learned it in the 19th century. 

> Despite its title, Strunk’s book hardly touched the topic of style. 

What about the recommendations?  There are only two.  One is Williams'
_Style: Toward Clarity and Grace_.  The other is _The Sense of Style_
by Steven Pinker.  I guess the blurb is correct in that he "cites some
alternatives", but I was expecting a bit more.  I'm certainly thrilled
to see Williams cited.  And I'm going to take a look at the Pinker book.

It makes me sad that the UofC press has allowed _Style_ to go out
of print.  I wonder whether the article will have any effect on it
coming back into print.  In any case, I continue to pick up used copies
when I can so that I have enough to loan to students and colleagues.
But it would be nice for it to be back in print.

On a separate note, I will admit that I got a bit frustrated at many of
the comments [2], most of which are on the order of "Strunk & White's
essential message is: Simple, Clear, Direct. I talk to my students
about these three words in every class."  That's all well and good,
but it ignores one of the key criticisms: Strunk & White don't teach
you how to achieve those goals.  Here's a followup I wrote (which may
or may not appear, depending on what the moderators do).

> There's a big difference between telling and teaching. As Pullum
suggests, although Strunk & White tell students to be simple, clear,
and direct, they do not teach them strategies for achieving simplicity,
clarity, and directness. (Or perhaps they do not sufficiently teach
them these strategies.) Take a look at Williams' _Style: Toward Clarity
and Grace_, in which he carefully breaks down how people read works and
ways to achieve the three basic goals. It's not perfect, but it gives
students guidance on how to reach the goals and accepts that reaching
the goals requires work.

That reminds me: I should probably re-read Williams.  Maybe I'll make it
my next choice for [the Rebelsky Family Book Club](family-book-club-mindset).

[1] I'm pretty sure that the old _Lingua Franca_ was important in spreading
discussions of the Sokal experiment, among other things.

[2] I'd swear there were no comments the first two times I looked at the
article; there are a bunch now.

Comics that matter: Master race
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc)*

*Trigger warning: This musing includes images of a comic book story about the Holocaust.*

About three weeks ago, [_The New York
Times_ had a short article about a famous comic
book](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/arts/design/master-race-comic-book-auction.html),
or, more precisely, a famous comic book story called "The Master Race",
whose original art was up for auction.  The comic was written by Al
Feldstein, one of the greats from EC Comics (and Mad Magazine), and
illustrated by Bernie Krigstein.  It presents a damning and vivid story
of the Holocaust.

The initial estimate was that it would bring
$150,000.  I checked today, and [it sold for
$600,000](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/arts/master-race-comic-book-sold.html).

What's the story like?  People more articulate than I have
written a lot about it; not just the subject matter, but
also ways in which Krigstein takes advantage of the medium.
I'll just say that I find it moving and I appreciate the
standard EC "twist".  But you don't have to read the opinions
of others.  The original art is still available to browse on [the auction
site](https://comics.ha.com/itm/original-comic-art/bernie-krigstein-impact-1-complete-8-page-story-master-race-original-art-ec-1955-total-8-items-/a/7192-91024.s?ic4=GalleryView-ShortDescription-071515#),
which means that you can browse it yourself.  Click on the images below

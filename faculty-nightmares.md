Faculty nightmares
==================

The other night, I woke up from a nightmare.  I think it's a nightmare
that only a faculty member could have.  Now, given the traditional nightmares
(or just fears) people have of things like speaking naked in front of a
large audience, you might think it was something like that.  But no; it
was much different.  It went something like the following [1].

It was a Tuesday morning.  I realized that I hadn't prepared anything for
my Tutorial [2] that day.  "That's okay," I said to myself, "I can reuse
one of my editing exercises from past Tutorials."  So I printed out the
editing exercise and headed off to photocopy [3] it.

For some reason (well, dream logic), I had to photocopy it at the
bookstore, which, in my dream, has two photocopiers.  But when I went
to use one, I was told "I'm sorry, but our policies have changed.  We
no longer trust faculty to use the photocopier."  So I had to fill out
a form.  Amazingly, the person who was supposed to do my photocopying
had never used one before.  So they were slow.  And they didn't photocopy
from single-sided to double-sided, like I wanted.  ("Whoops!  The policy
is new, so the forms are new.  We forgot about that option.")

Anyway, what should have been a ten-minute photocopying job ended up
being a one-hour photocopying job.  And that meant I was late for class.

So I'm rushing to make it to Tutorial, and to remember where my Tutorial
is [5].  Then I realize I have a 9 a.m. appointment on Tuesday morning [6].
So I ask myself "How can I have made an appointment during Tutorial?"
Then I realize that I have a schedule with *no* classes on Tuesdays.
And I say "[swear word], did I really spend half the semester only 
holding Tutorial on Thursdays?"

Yeah, missing half of the classes for half a semester is scary enough 
to wake me up.

I think I had at least one other related dream the same night, because I
also have this associated memory of sending a really nasty note to some
administrator about Tutorial evaluation forms, and a change in how they
were distributed.  And, while I've recently sent a note to a few folks
about end-of-course evaluations, that note was on a separate subject.

[1] Dreams always seem a bit different in the light of day.

[2] Tutorial is a class required of all Grinnell students, focused on
helping students develop their academic skills, particularly their
writing skills.  "First-year seminar" is among the terms used for
similar classes at other institutions.

[3] Note that the term "Xerox" [4] is probably still a registered trademark.
In addition, we do not use Xerox-brand photocopiers, so the term would
also be inappropriate.

[4] Do you know the story of Xerox?  It's a fun one.  I should probably
write a short essay on my not-quite-accurate view of Xerox.

[5] Traditionally, I remember where my classes are.  Remember, it's a
dream, it doesn't have to make perfect sense.

[6] Yes, I do have a 9:00 a.m. meeting this coming Tuesday.  Dreams and
nightmares are so much better when they incorporate reality.

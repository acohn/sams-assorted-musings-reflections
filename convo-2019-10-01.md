Last week, I attended one of the best Scholars' Convocations I've
attended in some time.  [Kate Manne](http://www.katemanne.net/)
gave a talk entitled "Unassuming: On Epistemic Entitlement,
Mansplaining, and Gaslighting".  I know, I know; the title alone
is enough to garner interest.  And I expect you therefore want to
know more.  However, since she asked that we not take pictures or
live Tweet her session, it seems that I should not write much about
the content.  Nonetheless, I can write a bit about the form and
some context, which may explain why I thought it was an excellent
Convocation.

I will admit that I had approached the Convocation with some
trepidation.  I had started to read Manne's _Down Girl: The Logic
of Misogyny_ and found it tough to get through.  Sometimes I wonder
if I'm smart enough to understand deep philosophical arguments.
I also hadn't looked for a title for the Convocation; I just attended
on general principle.

But Convocation really was excellent.  Certainly, the topic was of
interest.  As someone who, on occasion, falls into the habit of
mansplaining [1,2], I appreciate hearing more about what enables
the behavior and how to address it.  I really appreciate the way
that Manne was able to weave together deep philosophy [4], clear
explanations and definitions, and some painfully humorous examples.
She also did a wonderful job of answering questions at the end.
And the folks who asked questions asked thoughtful, albeit sometimes
complex, questions.

My favorite part of the Convocation was something that was outside
of Manne's control.  Midway through her talk, she said something
like, 

> I'm not sure how someone who claims to be a public intellectual
can make claims about a topic involving women and people of color
without appearing to have read, interviewed, or even having appeared
to talk to a black woman.

A child in the room, who had been sitting quietly and listening,
was clearly so upset by this concept that they immediately broke 
down into tears.  That was clearly the correct reaction.

In any case, it was a great talk, well worth my time.  It seems
like I should return to _Down Girl_ and try again.  And I look
forward to reading the book chapter that it sounds like Manne is
planning on the topics of this talk.

Thanks to all those who made this visit possible: Susan Ferrari,
the Philosophy department, the GWSS [5] committee [6], and others that
I'm probably missing.

Postscript: I see that I also posted [a musing on Convocation](convo-2019-09-01)
exactly a month ago.  I don't expect to make Convo musings the normal start
of each month, but it may still happen.

[1] I can even see myself in the role of the mansplainer in the 
[famous Rebecca Solnit piece](https://www.guernicamag.com/rebecca-solnit-men-explain-things-to-me/).  I've certainly pontificated on issues that I
know primarily from reviews in _The New York Times_.

[2] Long ago, I recall a comic strip, perhaps Doonesbury, perhaps
Tank McNamara [3], that described "Male Answer Syndrome", the need of
men to provide an answer to anything they are asked, even if they
have no clue.  I'm not sure what in our society 

[3] It turns out that it was [Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.com/1985/index.php?num=167).  I miss Eyebeam.  It remains one of my favorite strips.

[4] At least deep to me.

[5] Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies.

[6] Isn't it time that GWSS becomes a department?

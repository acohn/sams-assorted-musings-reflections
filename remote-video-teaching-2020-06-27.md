In the spring, as Grinnell moved online, one of the primary mantras
was "technological minimalism".  I get it. Students were stressed
enough with leaving campus and having to become online learners was
a huge challenge, having to master (or even understand) multiple
software packages added to that stress.  But that mantra has continued
through the summer as we plan for the fall.  I must admit that I,
and many others, feel that our new mantra should acknowledge that
even similar software has different capabilities and that our
primary goals should be pedagogical excellence and the privacy
and security for our students and ourselves.  There are, of course,
other appropriate issues to consider, such as cost and difficulty
of support.  But if we want to live up to our promises to our
students and ourselves about the quality of Grinnell online teaching,
we need to acknowledge that we should be focusing on the
software that best supports great teaching and great teaching
practices and not just relying on the software that we happen to
have purchased for other reasons, such as compatibility with existing
systems.

As someone who not only relies on technology for their teaching but
also teaches discipline-specific technology and even teaches students
how to develop their own technologies, these are issues close to my
heart and closer still to my professional identities [1].  I care that
students use "best practices" in software development, which include
particular technologies.  I care that they be able to use the software
they have developed themselves, even if it has not gone through an
approval process.  I care that they have the opportunity to compare 
different approaches, particularly as we discuss issues of usability 
and accessibility.

But for now, I'm staying away from the particulars of my professions.
Instead, I'm going to focus on the kind of software we can use for
synchronous, remote, face-to-face [2], teaching experiences.  Some
people call such software "videoconferencing software".  I will
admit that I do, too [3].  However, our focus is *teaching*, not
conferencing.  "Videoteaching" calls to mind those old broadcasts
or videotapes or DVDs.  Perhaps "Educational Videodialogue Packages".
In any case, the terminology is less important than the intent, at
least for the purposes of this musing.

When you talk about such technology, at least in summer 2020, most
people think of Zoom.  Zoom seems to have achieved a near-genericism,
similar to that of, say, Kleenex and Xerox.  But there are other
technologies.  Since, at Grinnell, we are told not to host our own
Zoom sessions [4], it is necessary to consider those other technologies.

Despite its insistence on "technological minimalism" for teaching,
the College has provided us with four different "solutions" for
cases in which we want to communicate with our students and each
other using video [5]: Cisco Webex [6], Microsoft Teams, Blackboard
Collaborate (BBC), and GoToMeeting.  The last is a remnant of the DT
revolution at Grinnell, and we are told it will disappear this
summer.  Hence, in my discussions, I will consider only the first
three: Webex, Teams, and BBC.

What are the features I want as an online teacher of small,
synchronous, personalized, modern, face-to-face classes?  There are
a lot.  I'm pretty sure that no one piece of software supports them
all.  Nonetheless, it's worth considering them and how well each
Grinnell-approved [8] platform supports them.  I've listed features
in no particular order, perhaps guided most by what came to mind when
I was sketching, drafting, or editing this musing.

*Grid View* (aka *Brady-Bunch View*).  You'll note that I've been
using "face-to-face" in my descriptions of the kind of teaching I
plan on doing and that I expect most of my colleagues plan on doing.
I know (we know) that the best teaching reacts to the people in the
room, their facial expressions, their twitches, their attention,
or lack thereof.  Just yesterday, in a discussion of online advising,
we were told "Don't just pay attention to their words; pay attention
to their faces and their posture".

Our students also want to see each other.  I still recall the joy I
felt upon seeing my classmates in _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_
after spring break.  I love the ability to see my research students'
faces each weekday morning.  And I think they feel the same [9].

So the ability to see all of the faces in a class (at least a class
of twenty-four or fewer students) is an *essential* feature of any
synchronous, video-enhanced, remote, teaching environment.  Of the
three platforms Grinnell currently supports [10], only Webex provides
a grid view.  You can get a row of six or so faces in Teams.  I think
it's three on BBC.

*A Robust Infrastructure*.  If the system isn't up, you can't teach.
But it's more than that.  Although each platform performs similar
tasks, particularly with regards to video sharing, they seem to do
so with different adaptions to, say, bandwidth or latency.  If you
can't send and receive video, the grid doesn't matter.  I've rarely
had a problem with Webex, including Webex sessions with hundreds
of people [11].  I'm not sure I've ever attended a BBC session in
which I didn't drop out regularly.  Teams seems to break up a lot.
I've even found Webex to be better than Zoom in this respect.  Webex,
at least the Webex application, is also pretty good at letting you
turn off things like incoming video, if necessary.

*Background Privacy*.  Students should not have to show their living
arrangements to other students (or show that they are sitting outside
the library or in a car because they have no home Internet or even
no home).  Faculty shouldn't either.  An ability to mask your
background contributes to the equity that Grinnell promotes as
essential.  Yet of our three platforms, only Teams seems to allow
you to mask your background.  It may be that add-ons, such as [Snap
Camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) can help.  However, as
far as I know, no add-on is approved, endorsed, or supported.  In
some situations, one might be able to hang a sheet or blanket in
the background.  However, that doesn't hold in every situation.
Students can turn off their video.  But that leads to the problem
that their teacher and their peers can't see them.  Hence, the
ability to remove your background is necessary for equity, and
should not be considered optional.  

I'd also recommend that we provide every student with a headset so
that they don't have to worry about background noises, such as loud
siblings or information on where/how they live.  And I'm assuming
that we've ensured that each student has enough bandwidth and computing 
power.  But I'll treat those issues as separate from the
software platform, perhaps a topic for a separate musing.

*Breakout Groups*.  Most modern methods of pedagogy include both
small-group and full-class work.  If we're doing that in an online
situation, students and faculty must quickly and naturally transition
from the full class to small groups and back again.  Faculty members
must also be able to check in with each group.  As far as I know,
of Grinnell's three platforms, only BBC has a feature for breakout
groups [12].  You can simulate it on Teams by having students
start separate video chats with assigned groups, but that's less
natural and less efficient than a platform that pre-builds breakout
groups.

*Recording*.  Not all students will be able to make it to class.
Even those who do may find that a recording provides a useful
mechanism for reviewing topics [14].  I'm pretty sure that every
platform provides such mechanisms.  One difference I've seen is
how long it takes for the recording to become available, since a
lot of post-processing seems to be necessary, and most platforms
did not have the infrastructure to scale up for the change in usage
after our the spring break that led to the broken spring.

*Privacy from recording.*  Not everyone in a class wants to be
recorded.  Many certainly don't want their image, voice, or name
recorded.  You should, therefore, be able to "opt out" of recording,
having your image, voice, or name hidden or replaced by another
image, an obscured voice, or a different name.  I'll admit that I'm
not sure what the status is of such features.  I recall being told
that BBC only records the instructor's image and screen (if shared),
but I could be wrong about that.  I wonder if Grinnell has this
documented anywhere.  I wonder if that's something I should push
on.  Someone should.  Maybe an Associate Dean reads my musings and
will reflect.

At least most platforms seem to notify users that their session is
being recorded, even if it's not immediately obvious *what* is being
recorded.

However, I'll note that I've seen a recent event that gives me some
concern.  A colleague was in a Webex session and had turned their
microphone off.  Their "muted" button was visible on their system.
However, their background sounds were also playing to everyone in
that Webex session.  Fortunately, the session was not being recorded
[17,20].

*Broader support for privacy*.  At the very least, I'd like to see
clear and sensible privacy policies for the products and platforms
we use.  I've yet to find any.

*Application and other screen sharing*.  Moving in the opposite direction,
it should be possible for the leader of a class to share an application
or their whole screen with some confidence that they know what is being
shared.  I'd like to share a tab, rather than a whole browser, or a browser,
rather than my whole screen.  I'd like to let my students share, too,
although I'd prefer to have a chance to preview what they are going to
share [21].  I haven't played enough with screen sharing to be sure, but
I don't think "preview other" is available.  There are also times I'd
like keyboard and mouse sharing.  As far as I can tell, that last feature
is only available in Teams and doesn't always work particularly well there.
Sharing of PowerPoint decks also works poorly in Teams, which makes
absolutely no sense to me.

*Shared whiteboards*.  It's nice to have a place that everyone can write
or comment.  I'm pretty sure that every platform has some kind of shared
whiteboard.  However, I also know that they are not equivalently intuitive.
Is it BBC whose erase button erases everything on the screen?  I forget.
It would probably be nicer (and even more "minimalist") to have a
common, high-quality, shared whiteboard application.

*Shared control*.  As an instructor, I should be focusing on teaching,
not on using software.  Hence, I want to be able to designate someone
else in my class to do some of the administrative tasks: Booting
people who don't belong (those are rare in my experience, but I
know it happened a lot in Zoom), silencing those who did not silence
themselves, keeping track of "raised hands".  things like that.
When I've participated in meetings, the most successful ones have
been those in which different folks had different roles.  I'm pretty
sure that Webex lets you shift control around, but I'm not sure if
you can shift it to students, who are not permitted to host meetings.
In Teams, it appears that only the leaders of a Team can take on
these roles, but no explicit shifting is necessary.  I'm not sure
that I want to make students Team leaders.  I have no idea what is
or is not possible in BBC.  I guess that's something to explore.

*Wide platform support*.  The software should run on all the major
platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux), including on older machines and
older versions of the software.  Ideally, it also runs on other
kinds of devices, such as tablets or phones.  I'm pretty sure that
most major systems work on any Web browser.  Well, maybe any Web
browser on some operating systems [22].  I'll admit that I haven't
checked these aspects of any of our platforms.  But it's something
I want to see.

*Anyone can host meetings*.  Not all meetings happen during class
time.  Ideally, students would meet and collaborate with each other
on the same platform they use in class.  Ideally, teaching assistants
[23] can also run sessions using the same platform.  This past
spring, the College didn't seem willing to provide Webex accounts
to our teaching assistants [25], let alone our students.  I'm pretty
sure that students can only host meetings on Teams.  But that
shouldn't be the reason to choose a platform.

*Chat!*  It seems obvious, doesn't it?  Or maybe it doesn't.  Side
conversations can be bad.  But we all know the benefits of being
able to make a few side comments, even a few snide side comments.
I've learned that [some active learning strategies take advantage
of
chat features](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/2020/06/active-learning-in-hybrid-and-socially-distanced-classrooms/).
I'm not sure that any system stands out.  Teams probably gives the
most freedom, since Teams Video is integrated into Teams Chat.  But
it also requires switching screens, as it were.

*Usability*.  I expect systems to be *easy to use and easy to
navigate*.  Since I keep seeing people having to teach others,
including those who supposedly know about the platforms, about
features, I'm not sure we can say that about any of the platforms.
I've seen, for example, that few people know how to turn off
*incoming* video in Webex, even though doing so is useful in
low-bandwidth situations.

Anyway, that's my preliminary list.  No platform supports it all.
Still, it feels like we can do better, that we can find a platform
that supports active teaching and learning, that is to use, that provides a
wide variety of resources, and that students, faculty, and staff
can all use equally.  That would give us both technological minimalism
and some form of pedagogical maximalism.  It just won't be any of
the platforms "we've" chosen [25].

**_Postscript_**: I thank the many colleagues whose conversations,
comments, and statements have informed my thinking on these issues.
Feel free to claim credit, but not blame, for my statements.

[1] Among other things, I'm a computer scientist, a software
developer, an educator, and an educator of computer science and
software development.  Right now, I focus on those last two identities.

[2] Sometimes "face to face" is used to mean "in person".  Here, I mean
"able to see each others' faces".

[3] I even called an early draft of this "Videoconferencing software".

[4] Some faculty members find it amusing that most of the external
training we receive on teaching online happens through Zoom.  Others
use different adjectives than "amusing".  I'll let you fill in your
own.

[5] I suppose that when employees (staff and faculty) meet with each
other, we can call it "videoconferencing".

[6] No, not WebEx. While it may deliver stuff (video), it's unrelated
to FedEx [7].  Also not Web X, as I've seen it written.  It is not the
tenth Web, although perhaps it is a mutant.

[7] I believe an earlier version was called WebEx.  Perhaps Cisco renamed
the product when it purchased it.

[8] Or maybe "endorsed".  I can never get administrative terminology 
straight.  I wonder if there's a guide out there.

[9] Well, they may not want to see *my* face.  But I'm pretty sure that
they appreciate seeing each others' faces.

[10] Support, endorse, approve, ....  I'm never sure which term is
appropriate in which location.  As I said, I need a guide.

[11] You can only see twenty-five or so at once.

[12] Zoom does, too, but it's not under consideration.

[14] Some may find that their subconscious benefits from listening to
class recordings as they fall asleep.  Or is it that class recordings
put them to sleep?  I can never get that straight.  I just know that
I always felt smarter after putting my textbook under my pillow at
bedtime.  Or perhaps I used my textbook as a pillow in the library.
Maybe both [15].

[15] I understand that some Grinnell parents have started to read
my musings.  I wonder what it must feel like to read a comment like
that, not be sure if I'm joking, and then worry about having someone
like me teach their children.  Dear Parents: I may be snarky and
sarcastic, but evidence suggests that (a) I teach well and (b) most
students appreciate my approaches to education [16].

[16] Not all students do.  But few students appreciate any particular
pedagogy or pedagogue.

[17] Well, the host wasn't recording it.  Who knows what Cisco is doing
with all the meetings flowing through its platform.  Does it count as
insider training if your system learning things through, say, the tenor
of conversations (something you might study for improving the platform)
even if you don't listen to the content? [18]

[18] I do not believe that Cisco intentionally records things without
making people aware.  The damage to their reputation would be too
great if such behavior were revealed.  But there are people out there
with less faith in companies than I have, and they've proven to be right
more than I'd expect [19].

[19] "The NSA would never compromise Americans' security to ensure that
they can read messages."  Then we hear about their "contributions" to
https and other protocols.

[20] I was told that this seems to have been a one-of-a-kind occurrence.
However, I recall faculty meetings in which our Dean or President had a
sign that their mic was on and found that it was off, or vice versa.

[21] There were too many Zoom-bombing incidents across the country
this spring.

[22] Requisite anecdote: Earlier this summer, I graded AP Computer
Science Principles Exams.  Grading required training.  But the
training software didn't work everywhere, even though it was
supposedly Web-based software.  The solution for those on Macs?
"Upgrade to Catalina".  Do they not know how long that takes?

[23] "Class mentors" at Grinnell [24].

[24] There are some new terms for the position, too. Because of some 
mistakes and miscommunication, some forms of "mentor" ended up at a
lower pay scale than they should have received.

[25] In case it wasn't clear, I put "we" in quotation marks because it
does not feel like faculty were closely involved in any of the decisions,
except, perhaps, to add Blackboard Collaborate (BBC) to Blackboard.

SamR's Sarcasm
==============

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), [autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

As I was walking in to work today [1], I was reflecting on the Avital
Ronnell case [2].  I'd seen enough of a variety of interesting quotations
about the case that I found myself tempted to put them together into
some kind of musing.  Of course, I was also thinking more broadly about
the case.  I'm not sure exactly what words I used, but I said something to
myself like, 

> Faculty members should understand the power dynamic at play.
Students aren't going to challenge your 'idiosyncratic personality'
and the expectations your style of interacting with others raise.
It's your job, not your students', to reflect on how these kinds of
interactions affect your students and to correct, as necessary.

Then I swore.

Why?

Because that comment could easily describe me.  One of my defining
characteristics is that I regularly use sarcasm [3] in my teaching and
other interactions with people [4].  I think of it as friendly sarcasm,
but I expect that not everyone finds it that way.  I did try to tone
it down a few years ago, but teaching felt less natural, and I went back
to my old ways.

"Teaching felt less natural" is not an excuse.  I commit to doing
better.

Postscript: I also need to work on my "righteous anger".  However,
that's not something I use with students.

[1] Today is an @Grinnell day.

[2] Those who don't know about the case can read about it in [_The Chronicle of Higher Education_](https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-a-Letter-Defending-Avital/243650), [_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/nyregion/sexual-harassment-nyu-female-professor.html), or even [_The Los Angeles Review of Books_](http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/essays/avital-nimrod-sexual-harassment-campy-communications-nyu/).  As you might expect, _Chronicle_ also has a broad array of related articles.

[3] Or snark, if you'd prefer to define it that way.

[4] I do have other defining characteristics.  I care deeply
about my students and about the process of teaching.  I tend to
[overcommit](index-overcommitment).  You can find others.

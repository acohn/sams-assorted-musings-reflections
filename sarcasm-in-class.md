SamR's Sarcasm
==============

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), [autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

As I was walking into work the other day [1], I was reflecting on the
Avital Ronell case [2].  I'd been keeping up with the situation and
found myself wanting to [react to some of the comments I'd seen](avital).
Of course, I was also thinking more broadly about the issues.  I'm not
sure exactly what words I used, but I said something to myself like,

> Faculty members should understand the power dynamic at play.
Students aren't going to challenge your 'idiosyncratic personality'
nor the expectations your style of interacting with others raises.
It's your job, not your students', to reflect on how these kinds of
interactions affect your students and to correct, as necessary.

Then I swore.

Why?

Because that comment could easily describe me.  One of my defining
characteristics is that I regularly use sarcasm [3] in my teaching and
other interactions with people [4].  I think of it as friendly sarcasm,
but I expect that not everyone finds it that way.  I did try to tone it
down a few years ago, but teaching felt less natural, and I went back
to my old ways.

Nonetheless, it's my job to reflect on how my interactions affect people.
"Teaching felt less natural" is not an excuse.  I commit to doing better.

Postscript: One of my other idiosyncracies is what we might call my
"righteous anger".  While that's not something I use with students [5],
it's something that affects others.  I also need to work on that.  

---

Postscript: In case it isn't clear: While I was inspired by my reaction
to the Avital Ronell situation, my sarcasm does not come anything close
to what Ronell is accused of.

[1] That day was an @Grinnell day.

[2] Those who don't know about the case can read about it in [_The Chronicle of Higher Education_](https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-a-Letter-Defending-Avital/243650), [_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/nyregion/sexual-harassment-nyu-female-professor.html), or even [_The Los Angeles Review of Books_](http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/essays/avital-nimrod-sexual-harassment-campy-communications-nyu/).  As you might expect, _Chronicle_ also has a broad array of related articles.

[3] Or snark, if you'd prefer to define it that way.

[4] I do have other defining characteristics.  I care deeply
about my students and about the process of teaching.  I tend to
[overcommit](index-overcommitment).  You can find others.

[5] However, I have been known to use it on behalf of students.

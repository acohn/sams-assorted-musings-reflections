_The Shakespeare Requirement_
=============================

*Topics/tags: [Reviews](index-reviews), novels, academia, CS@Grinnell, disconnected*

*Warning!  Although this musing starts as a review of a book, it detours
into other issues in academia, particularly in my department.*

I've read a wide variety of books in the past few years. Julie
Schumacher's _Dear Committee Members_ is among my favorites.  In part, it's
the form; the novel is written as a series of recommendation letters.
But it's more that I enjoyed seeing the send-up of academia and its
processes.  I also found many parts laugh-out-loud hilarious, particularly
the responses to one of those fury-inducing online recommendation forms.

So, when I saw Schumacher's new novel, _The Shakespeare Requirement_,
I picked it up immediately.  I managed to read it over the past week.
It is, in some sense, a follow-up to _Dear Committee Members_; it shares
characters with the former book, and it is also a send-up of academia.
But I'm not sure how I feel about it; while I enjoyed it and laughed
out loud at a few parts, I didn't find it up to the standards of _Dear
Committee Members_.

What didn't I like?  The novel had three or four main threads.  While they
all ended at the end of the novel, they didn't tie together as well as
I'd hoped.  And, well, they all ended up a bit shorter than I'd expected.
Plus, the novel ends with characters making a decision that's funny,
but ultimately unethical and inappropriate.  I was frustrated to see a
character that I like compromised, even when he's already an imperfect
personality.  And it somehow felt worse because he'd redeemed himself
(at least somewhat) only a few pages earlier.

I was also sad to see the way in which Economics was treated in the book.
In many ways, Econ was a stand-in for all of the departments that
are growing at liberal arts colleges, ones that more explicitly leads
to jobs than do the humanistic majors that are essential to a strong
liberal arts major.  My impression has been that every department at
Grinnell understands and appreciates that the other departments do
their work primarily to grow students' minds and contribute to their
broader education.  But this book treats Econ as concerned more about
their own status more than about students, and about preparing students
for jobs more than developing the broader human.

Nonetheless, the book did get me to think more about the way I talk about
our students.  While I'm reasonably sure that my colleagues understand
that I'm passionate about teaching my students, perhaps I need to cut back
a bit on talking about our success at placing students.  However, I'm not
sure that I can do so; while I don't believe that students should major
in CS because of the available jobs, I do consider it part of our mission
to help students to move up the socio-economic spectrum. For better or
for worse, careers in CS can help do so.  Damn, there I go again.

More importantly, the book attacks the way that "successful" departments
encroach upon other departments.  And, well, CS is doing something
like that.  We don't have room on our floor for our newest faculty
member.  That means that one of the senior faculty members [1] will
need to move their office and lab elsewhere in the science building.
But where?  All of the sciences are cramped for space. The Science
building was built for a population of 1500 students when about 35%
of Grinnell students chose to major in the sciences.  We now have a
population of 1700 students and about 45% now major in the sciences.
So, even though we built the Science Building with a bit of extra space,
it's likely that all of that space has been consumed.

Then there's the issue of classroom space.  We've already converted
our "open lab" into a classroom to meet demands.  Math/Stats has also
generously allowed us to use one of their computing classrooms for
the occasional class.  However, those additional resources are nearly
exhausted; we're close to the point at which we may need more computing
classrooms than we have, especially if the new schedule is adopted [2].
Because we emphasize pair programming in a Linux environment, our classroom 
needs are also different than most people's.

Are we trying to encroach on other peoples' space?  No, we are not.  Do
we need more space than we have?  Yes, we do.  What's the solution?  I'll
leave that up to the Dean.  Hopefully, he'll come up with a good solution.

As the preceding paragraphs suggest, _The Shakespeare Requirement_
reminded me that there are times when there's a gap between a department's
intentions and motivations and those that others attribute to that
department.  I don't know how to address that, other than to talk to
each other.

My, that was a long detour.  Back to the book.  What should you know?
It's set at a small liberal arts college and reflects on many of
the current concerns of such institutions by taking some to the extreme.
It has some funny bits.  It's also sad in places.  The main character is
fallible, but not nearly as curmudgeonly as in _Dear Committee Members_.
There are multiple threads to the story, none of which reach a completely
satisfactory end.  I'm glad I read it, but I still think it could have
been better.  I'd recommend it to folks in academia, but not nearly as
much as _Dear Committee Members_.

Postscript: When I wrote "reflects on the current concerns of such
institutions", which happened in the last [3] revision of this musing,
I realized that it does not bring in Title IX.  Now I'm troubled
because I've realized that the book does contain an incident which is
potentially a Title IX issue [4].  Would Schumacher have lost readers
if she'd included Title IX in the book?  I'm not sure.  Title IX is not
something that supporters of survivors or opponents of the Obama-era
Title IX interpretations take lightly.  Still, it makes me worry a bit
more about how the student is treated in this book.  It will take more
thought than I have at the moment to work out all the issues.  Maybe I'll
have to reread it keeping those issues in mind.  I'd love to hear
from someone else who has read it.

Postscript: You want to know something more about the content of the
book?  Let's see.  Our main character, Jason Figer, MFA, has just become
chair of English at a small liberal-arts college [5].  English shares a
building with Econ.  The chair of Econ is an empire builder.  English is
under-resourced and dysfunctional.  The latest round of "You must write
a departmental mission statement" has led to a statement that does not
mention Shakespeare, which angers the department's Shakespeare scholar.
Trouble ensues.

Postscript: The more I write, the more I come to understand my reaction
to the book.  In part, I've discovered that I'm unhappy with the book
because Schumacher appears to be writing about many of her characters
with derision rather than affection.  That makes them closer to shallow
caricatures than to fully-formed people.  Perhaps I'll have to reread
the book to check my interpretation.  Or perhaps I'll find someone else
who has read the book to chat with.

---

[1] Yes, there's a good chance it will be me.

[2] I sincerely hope that it is not adopted.

[3] Second or third.

[4] Sorry for the lack of details.  I don't want to give away critical
parts of the plot.

[5] Maybe it's not a small liberal-arts college.  The prior book mentions
graduate students.

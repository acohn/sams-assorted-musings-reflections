_The Shakespeare Requirement_
=============================

*Topics/tags: [Reviews](index-reviews), novels, academia*

I've read a wide variety of books in the past few years. Julie
Schumacher's _Dear Committee Members_ is among my favorite.  In part, it's
the form; the novel is written as a series of recommendation letters.
But it's more that I enjoyed seeing the send-up of academia and its
processes.  I also found many parts laugh-out-loud hilarious, particularly
the responses to one of those fury-inducing online recommendation forms.

So, when I say her new Schumacher's new novel, _The Shakespeare
Requirement_, I picked it up immediately and I managed to read it over
the past week.  It is, in some sense, a follow-up to _Dear Committee
Members_; it shares characters and it is also a send up of academia.
But i'm not sure how I feel about it; while I enjoyed it and laughed
out loud at a few parts, I didn't find it up to the standards of _Dear
Committee Members_.

What didn't I like?  The novel had three or four main threads.  While they
all ended at the end of the novel, they didn't tie together as well as
I'd hoped.  And, well, they all ended up a bit shorter than I'd expected.
Plus, the novel ends with a decisions that's funny, but ultimatedly
unethical and inappropriate.  I don't like seeing a character that I
like compromised, even when he's already an imperfect personality.

I was also sad to see the way in which Economics was treated in the book.
In many ways, Econ was a stand-in for all of the departments that
are growing at liberal arts colleges, ones that more explicitly leads
to jobs than do the humanistic majors that are essential to a strong
liberal arts major.  My impression has been that every department at
Grinnell understands and appreciates that the other departments do
their work primarily to grow students' minds and contribute to their
broader education.  But this book treats Econ as concerned more about
their own status more than about students, and about preparing students
for jobs more than develping the broader human.

Nonetheless, the book did get me to think more about the way I talk about
our students.  While I'm fairly sure that my colleagues understand that
I'm passionate about teaching my students, perhaps I need to cut back a
bit on talking about our success at placing students.  However, I'm not
sure that I can do so; while I don't consider jobs the primary reason
that students should major in CS, I do consider part of our mission to
help students to move up the socio-economic specturm and, for better or
for worse, careers in CS can help do so.  Damn, there I go again.

More importantly, the book attacks the way that "successful" departments
encroach upon other departments.  And, well, CS is doing that.  We don't
have room on our floor for our newest addition.  That means that one of
the senior faculty members will need a

It snowed in Grinnell yesterday and last night.  About seven inches, give
or take.  It was beautiful.

I will admit that I was tempted to go on Facebook, post a photo, and write 
something like,

> I love the snow.

> Particularly when my sons are home to shovel.

But I'm [avoiding Facebook](social-media-2020-12-29).

In any case, Middle Son decided to shovel for a bit last night, in
the midst of the storm.  I'm not sure whether or not it had an
impact; we had a lot of wind.  I can tell about the wind because
parts of our backyard are nearly clear and parts are probably
fourteen inches or more.  While I don't particularly appreciate
shoveling the taller drifts, I do like looking at the landscape the
wind makes out back.

Today I'm particularly grateful for whoever decided to use their
snowblower on our front sidewalk.  Yes, I realize that there are
environmental implications, but it's nice to have less to shovel---or 
less for the boys to shovel.  (Arguably, I should say "less for
the men to shovel", but I expect we'll always call them "the boys".)
And I'm certainly glad that the boys are shoveling.

I went outside to help and was reminded of something I notice each
year: There are very different perspectives on shoveling.  Shovelers
differ in how much of a walk they shovel, side-to-side.  Some shovel
one shovel's width (or one blower's width, if they blow snow).  Some
make sure to shovel the full width of the walk.  I tend to fall
into the latter camp.  I realize that it's much faster when you
shovel less.  But I always look toward the next snowstorm, and I
know that I find it harder to do a second shovel unless I've cleared
the walk completely after the prior storm.

Then there's a question of how much you clear.  Some folks are
comfortable leaving a lot of snow on the parts they've cleared.
The snow-blowers always leave a small layer of snow.  Some seem to
want to clear every speck.  I expect most folks fall somewhere in
the middle.  I prefer to clear off the little triangles at the edges
that come from shoveling at an angle, but I'm still comfortable leaving
the edges uneven and some snow around.

At our house---and I expect many others---there's also a question of
which walks you clear.  I count about eight at our house.  There's
the normal "sidewalk" that runs parallel to the street outside, Main
Street in our case.  There's a walk from the front door of the house
to the main sidewalk.  There's a walk from the side porch to the main
sidewalk.  There are two walks from the main sidewalk to the street,
one a continuation of the front walk and one a continuation of the
side walk.  There's a walk from the back door to the garage.  There's
a walk that goes south around the garage to the alley.  And there's
a walk that goes north toward our parking spaces.  Oh, I suppose there's
also the parking spaces on the side of the garage and the apron to the
garage.  I described them in [an earlier musing](shoveling-2020-01-25).

So which do you clear?  Michelle doesn't generally worry about the
walks between the main sidewalk and the street; I prefer to shovel
both, completely.  Of course, those are among the most frustrating
to shovel.  Why?  Because the city likes to plow over whatever you've
shoveled.  At times, it's better to wait until the city plows because
that ensures that you have somewhat software snow underneath the
dirty snow.  But in normal times, you often want to get to or from
the street, such as when someone gets dropped off.  And when the 
main sidewalk is not shoveled or blown for the whole block, people
may want to get off the sidewalk.  So I always shovel at least one of
them.

We always shovel the front walk, the side walk, and the walk to the
garage.  I used to avoid shoveling the walk south of the garage,
but Michelle always wanted that shoveled.  These days, it's my path
to work, so I like it shoveled.  We generally put off the path to
the parking spaces.  I often shovel the apron; my minivan doesn't
clear snow well.  But I'm not driving much these days, so I didn't
worry about it today (and didn't ask the kids to worry about it).

**_Postscript_**: Today, in addition to asking me to muse about
shoveling, my muse challenged me to avoid endnotes.  I succeeded,
more or less.  I didn't add an endnote about "apron".  I didn't
note that "snowblower" can reference the machine or the being that
pushes the machine.  I didn't riff on the difference between
"sidewalk", which I used for the main walk parallel to Main, and
"side walk", which I used for walk from the side of the house to
the main walk.  Come to think of it, I didn't even riff on "main
walk" and "Main street" and whether that meant that I should call
it the "Main walk".  And I didn't ask whether it should be "end
note" or "endnote".

Of course, I did add a few parentheticals, one about my boys being
men and one about a blower's width.  And, in the paragraph above,
I did summarize at least half of the endnotes I would have written.
Did I meet the challenge?  That's unclear.  I suppose I've become like
one of those novice writers who deem it necessary to include all of
their thoughts, rather than valuing brevity. 

Oh well, at least you can skip the postscript.

**_Postscript_**: I appreciate that after Eldest Son came in from
shoveling, he said something like "I should know better than to shovel
the sidewalk from edge to edge."  I'm so proud.

**_Postscript_**: Since I've mentioned Middle and Eldest, I should note
that Youngest Son was the first one up to shovel this morning.  I
appreciate that, too.  I'm lucky to have three awesome sons.

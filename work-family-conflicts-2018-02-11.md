When work and family conflict
=============================

Yesterday, I wrote about [how my workaholism affects my ability to take
vacations with my family](workaholic-2018-02-10).  In putting that piece
together, I also started to think about other ways in which work and
family conflict.  There are certainly lots of small ones, particularly
the evenings and weekends in which I'm grading or preparing class instead
fo spending time with family.  And there are the really big ones, such as
planning vacations.

But there are also a bunch of things in the middle.  What do I do when a
family obligation and a work obligation conflict?  It happens a lot.  I
cut short our 25th anniversary vacation for the first day of class.  I've
missed at plays and concerts and more because I've been late coming back
from a conference or meeting [1].  For example, because I'm staying at
this year's SIGCSE through Saturday night, I may miss Middle Son's 
Singers Concert and Youngest Son's Court of Honor [2].

The things in the middle also include foreseeable conflicts.  For example,
this coming Friday, Middle Son is diving at 1:30 p.m.  I love to watch
Middle Son dive.  I like to support his colleagues.  But I teach classes
at 2:00 and 3:00 p.m., the 2:00 p.m. class class is a half-semester
course, and I'm already going to be gone at a conference two days the
following week.  And we just heard that Youngest Son's concert band will
be performing at the Iowa Bandmasters' associations meeting, which happens
to be the last day of classes.  [The last day of class](last-day-of-class)
is special, so it's hard to miss.

In the end, family wins.  I'm not sure that I've always felt that 
way [4,5].  But I do now.  I'm sure that my students will understand.

[1] Unfortunately, the schedule for the plays and concerts often comes out
long after I've made the travel plans.  And we live in Iowa.  So even when
I've made appropriate plans, the weather gets in the way.

[2] I'll almost certainly make the Court of Honor.  I'm not yet sure
about the Singers concert.  I think it's at 2:00 p.m. and I get in at
11:30 a.m. [3], but I have to wait for suitcases and, well, it's Iowa.

[3] Did I really decide to fly out of Baltimore at 7:30 a.m.?  I will be
up early that Sunday.

[4] I'm really good at forgetting things.  I'm particlarly good at 
forgetting my less-good decisions.

[5] Michelle probably knows.

A coat and tie
==============

Every five or so years, I decide to wear a sport coat and tie to work
each day.  There's usually no particular motivating factor; something
in my brain says "You should wear a coat and a tie."  I like ties; I can
wear bright and flashy things [1] and I get to cut off the flow of oxygen
to my brain [2].  I find life more pleasant that way.

I'm always interested to hear how people react.  "_Are you meeting with
someone?_" "Nope, I just decided to wear a coat and tie."  "_Why are
you wearing a suit?_"  "I'm not.  It's a sport coat [3]." "_What's the
special occasion?_" "There isn't one."

Best of all, "_My, you look dapper today._"

That seems to be the wrong d-word.  I'm pretty sure that I'm just
differently disheveled.

[1] I like ties with complex and non-regular patterns.

[2] At least that's what I claim.

[3] I don't claim to understand the terminology for women's fashion;
I shouldn't be surprised that others don't know the terminology for mine.

Business cards
==============

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), marketing, short*

As part of the new marketing campaign, our friends at Ologie [1]
designed business cards that, well, don't achieve the primary goals of
business cards.  What's wrong?  Let's see.

<img src="images/business-card" width="300" alt="An image of a business card.  See the following text for more information.">

The typeface was too small [2,3].   The most important information,
the name, is not the most obvious information on the page.  The College
name and department name are much bigger [4].  There are three different
typefaces in use.  The primary typeface, Futura, is intended as a display
face and should probably not be used for running text.  There's not enough
separation between the email address and the Web site.  I also think
that the address information should all be together [5].  And there's
way too much red.

There are also a few issues specific to my situation.  We call ourselves
the Department of Computer Science, not the Computer Science Department.
And my home page is on `www.cs.grinnell.edu` not on `grinnell.edu`.

But I tried to be cooperative.  So I asked the following basic questions.

1. We've always been "The Department of Computer Science".  Can that
be switched?

2. My home page is on `www.cs.grinnell.edu`, not `grinnell.edu`.
And the CS Web server is older.  Can I use that?

3. My professional identity includes a GitHub user id and a Twitter
handle.  Where do those go?

You can probably predict the answers, at least the answers to the first
two questions.  "We've decided to switch to a uniform naming scheme
for departments."  "You must use `grinnell.edu`."  I hate the
`grinnell.edu` thing, particularly since we've failed to meet
our own stated expectations for Web sites.  But I'd accept that.
But why "X Department"?  It makes sense for one-word departments.
"Biology Department".  "English Department".  It flows much less well for
multi-word departments.  "Chinese and Japanese Department" or "Department
of Chinese and Japanese"?  "Computer Science Department" or "Department
of Computer Science"?  "Theatre and Dance Department" or "Department of
Theatre and Dance"?  Putting "Department of" makes it clearer.  But
we have a standard that no one discussed with the faculty and I have to
accept it.

The response to the third question was more interesting.  "You could
replace one of your phone numbers with your GitHub id or Twitter handle".
But, well, I want all five pieces of contact info on my card.  There's
certainly room for it.  So I asked.  The answer, "You may not have more than
three pieces of contact information."

Bad formatting?  That I can deal with.  If the College wants to present
itself as design challenged, let it do so.  The Web site that was imposed
on us?  I'll live with that, too.  Renaming my department without
consulting us?  'Eh, I've dealt with worse.  But "We won't let you
include appropriate contact information"?  That's absurd.

Communications should be willing to acknowledge the reasonable needs
of faculty and staff.  They aren't.  I've reached my limit.  Screw it.
I guess I don't need business cards.

cards.

[3] The image uses the large font.

[4] It looks like they are closer in size in the current version.

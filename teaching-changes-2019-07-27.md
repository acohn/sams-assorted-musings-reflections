Changes in my teaching
======================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), writing, teaching, bragging*

The other day, one of my children shared [a podcast with Kumail
Nanjiani](https://radiopublic.com/inside-the-hive-with-nick-bilton-8599vo/ep/s1!377c8)
and said, "Dad, he mentions you at about 57:20".

Now, for those who haven't been paying attention, Kumail was both
a CS major [1] and a Philosophy major [2].  And, for some reason,
Kumail ended up being my advisee.  Kumail and I started at Grinnell
the same year, and so I've always considered myself one of the class
of '01 [3].  As I mentioned in [an earlier
musing](things-we-lose-2019-07-25), he even did summer research
with me and came along to a conference.  Kumail was also in two
classes, CSC 152, what was then the second course in the introductory
CS sequence, and CSC 323.

CSC 152 was a crammed course: We taught them Java (after they just
finished Scheme), data structures, algorithms, some object-oriented
design, and more.  Java was a simpler language then, so I got deeper
into algorithms and analysis then than I do now in CSC 207.  The
class had a weekly group programming projects and, to make things
more fun, I asked each group to write a short essay on what they
learned in the project.

But it's me.  I tend to have more things to do than I have time to
do them, particularly when I'm in the midst of teaching three courses
as well as running an independent study project.  And so I did not
get much of the grading done, other than the exams [7].  On the
last week of class, I finally gave up and said "grade your own
homework".  I'm pretty sure that no one gave themselves anything
higher than a B.  And, well, I got perfect end-of-course ratings.
Those students taught me that I should assign difficult work and
it didn't matter whether or not I graded it.

CSC 223 was our software design course.  Kumail was in a group that
designed an IMAP-based mail reader [8].  They had a great name for
it, "You've got mail: Kumail" [9].  I almost certainly had them
write a project report, although I can't recall what my requirements
[10] were.

Okay, you now have the context for Kumail's comment about me.  Let's
see what he said [11].

> I just had a couple thoughts.  One.  You know "memes" is an interesting
thing, obviously.  It's sort of a shared meaning and it's created
by a community and I see the positive aspect of it.  But, like, all
the the responses of GIFs and stuff.  I'm going to sound like such
a fuddy duddy, but I think people are getting worse and worse at
expressing themselves.  I think language separates us from f*cking
animals and people are getting worse and worse at it.  People speak
in the same phrases.  They reference the same memes.  They use the
same GIFs.  You know, Michael Jackson eating that popcorn or whatever
and the first time you see it, you're like "clever".

> Another computer science professor, Sam Rebelsky, at Grinnell.  He
wanted us to write papers about algorithms and this kind of stuff.  And
his thing was like "Do not use any phrases.  Don't use cliche phrases.
Don't use 'suffice it to say'.  Find your own way to say it."  Or that
kind of stuff.  And he would dock a third of a grade if you'd use a 
phrase that was a sort of autopilot phrase.  And that made me really
aware of how many times I speak in ways that are [Nick Bilton
interjects "Like everyone else"] like everyone else.  And I think
these GIFs are like an extreme version of that. [12]


---

[1] For his parents.

[2] For himself.

[3] Thanks to Vivek [4], I'm now an honorary member of that class [5].

[4] Rhymes with "like cake".

[5] Did you know that alumni relations doesn't keep track of honorary
members [6]?  That's sad.

[6] No, I am not saying that to imply I made up my honorary membership.
It's more that I am sad that they don't track such things.

[7] Yes, I know this sounds familiar.  Stay tuned.

[8] This was in 2000 or 2001.  Writing an IMAP-based mail reader was
a big deal.  Perhaps it still is.

[9] I'm pretty sure that revealing the project name does not violate
FERPA restrictions.

[10] In the first draft of this musing, I wrote "demands" rather than
"requirements".  I suppose that says something about how I think of them.

[11] Or at least let's see my attempt to transcribe what he said.

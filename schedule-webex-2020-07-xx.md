Because I was on sabbatical in the spring, I mostly spent time on Webex as
a visitor, rather than as a host [1].  When I did host meetings, it was
through my Personal Room rather than as a scheduled event.  But now I'm
at the point at which I need to schedule meetings.  And it feels like
I'm doing something wrong.  Why?  Because it takes too damn long, even if
I'm scheduling a meeting with one person.

Here are my steps.  If someone wants to tell me what I can do better,
I'd appreciate hearing it.

As far as I know, there's no convenient way for me to schedule
directly from the Webex meetings app.  When I click the "Schedule"
button, it starts Outlook.  I don't use Outlook.  I'm always reluctant
to start Outlook because, well, I have way too much mail in my
mailboxen, and I'm worried what it will be like.

So how do you schedule a meeting without Outlook?  I usually go to the
Webex Web site, <https://grinnellcollege.webex.com>.  I don't have it
bookmarked, but I find that autocomplete is faster in any case.  Most
of the time, it requires me to log in again.  When I'm lucky, it does
not require me to authenticate with Duo.  Today I was lucky.  But

Once I'm on the site, I can click the "Schedule" button.  That makes sense.
I get to enter a topic, a password, a date and time, and attendees.  I can
also enter advanced options.  When it's a meeting with other employees,
I tend to select "Anyone can host", since that ensures that the meeting
can start with the first attendee, rather than when I show up [2,3].
But selecting the time shows bad UI design, and I keep forgetting that.
Why is it bad?  There are pop-up menus for the hour and minutes.  I
tend to prefer to type times rather than use pop-up menus.  But if I
type a time and then hit tab, it returns to the old time, which I rarely
notice.  I suppose that once setting up meetings is a regular task, I'll
remember the bad UI.  But for now, it usually means that I end up with
the wrong time and then have to go back and fix it.  For noon meetings,
I have to balance accuracy with the application's capabilities.

Setting up a meeting this morning took me one minute and forty-five seconds.
I wish I could make that faster.

**_Postscript_**: As I mentioned in the main text, Webex falls prey to
the noon issue.  That is, it expects you to schedule noon as "12:00
pm".  But noon is not twelve hours after meridiem [4].  It is
meridiem.  And this is not just one of those stupid Sam annoyances
[5].  The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of
Standards and Technology explicitly says "**12 a.m. and 12 p.m. are
ambiguous and should not be used**" [6].

What do I do with crappy software like Webex?  If possible, I use
12:01 p.m. or 11:59 a.m.  But Cisco doesn't believe in units of one.  
Hence, I have to choose either 12:05 p.m. or 11:55 a.m.

You'd think a company that started with networking would care more
about precise times.

**_Postscript_**: Note that I publically share my own incompetencies because
(a) it allows me to get help, (b) it reminds people that everyone struggles
with technology, (c) it reminds designers that what they think is easy
or obvious may not be for others, and (d) it reminds those who dictate
technology of those same things.

[1] I don't even know the formal terms for these two roles.

[2] It doesn't help with students, since students can host.

[3] I find it incredibly frustrating that Webex doesn't provide the
same kind of meeting waiting rooms that Zoom provides.  I find that
if I'm early for a Webex meeting, I have to keep refreshing the
link until it strats.  Or maybe I'm missing something.

[4] Nor is it twelve hours post meridiem.

[5] It is one of those stupid Sam annoyances.  It is not *just* one of
those annoyances.

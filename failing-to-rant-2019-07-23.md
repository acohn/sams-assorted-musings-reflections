Failing to rant
===============

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta), short*

I regularly find things on campus that I feel compelled to complain about,
from strange policies to miscommunication to failure to follow promises.
As is my norm, I've found a variety of things that I'd like to rant
about this summer.  Even though I've started to write a variety of
rants, I've later decided that each one was inappropriate to post.
Some got pretty far; I even sent a draft of a nearly complete rant to
some colleagues because the rant referred to them.  They calmly explained
why my perspective was wrong [1].  And so I'm not posting that rant.

I was also tempted to write about the administration's unwillingness
to post the slide decks [2] from public talks.  However, an email
to an administrator revealed their reasons for delaying publication
until the fall.  I still think slide decks from public talks should be
public immediately after the talk [3], but what do I know.  In any case,
I'll leave the detailed rant until the fall, and I hope not to have to
write it.

I remain frustrated by long-standing issues, particularly related to
Web governance and privacy of P-Card data, but I've seen enough indication
of forward progress that I consider it appropriate to wait a bit longer
before I rant about those issues again.  And, in at least one case,
it feels like folks are listening to my suggestions [4].

I'm even holding off on critiquing the total failure of shared governance
represented by the new computer equipment replacement policy [5] because
it sounds like our new Dean is on top of it.  That is, she seems to
understand that there were issues in the process and she seems to
be willing to address them.  I should give her the opportunity [6].
As importantly, at first glance the corresponding new software policy
seems to have incorporated some shared governance.

But don't worry; I'll find something appropriate to rant about.  And I
hope that, when I do, you find that it's worth the wait.

[1] I agree that it was.

[2] Some might refer to those as "Powerpoints".

[3] Or, preferably, before the talk to be more accessible.

[4] Don't worry.  If I find that the institution's solution to either 
issue violates my delicate sensibilities, I'll rant about it.

[5] Well, I'm not completely holding off on that.

[6] I also probably owe her an introductory musing.

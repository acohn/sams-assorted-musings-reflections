The "Quantitative Reasoning" course tag
=======================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), academia*

Today, we received the agenda for Monday's faculty meeting and,
is is typical, I skimmed through it [1].  The agenda included both
a new pamphlet on the liberal arts we provide to students and a
report summarizing what we've learned from the [course tagging
project](course-tags-2018-03-30) [2].  For those who've forgotten, we've
added a set of labels to courses so that we can show our accreditors
that---even though we have chosen to let students design their own
undergraduate curricula instead of relying on particular requirements---we
provide students with an appropriate liberal arts education

In encountering the project, I've always had some concerns about the
Quantitative Reasoning course tag.  Seeing the two documents in sequence
helped crystalize my concerns.

Here's what we say about quantitative reasoning in the Catalog description
of the liberal arts.

> Quantitative reasoning, with emphasis on mathematical models and methods above the secondary-school level, aids in the expression of hypotheses, processes, and theoretical relations. A course in statistics can be helpful for all students, and particularly for those who might work in the social and behavioral sciences. Studies in computer science offer valuable exposure to principles of logic and problem-solving paradigms. [3,4]

Here's the description of what the course tag is supposed to suggest.

> This course provides students with the skills to study and interpret measurable quantities, typically appearing in the natural or social sciences. Such studies often require the interpretation of graphs or analysis of data sets and encourage fluency with fundamental quantitative tools. [6,7,8]

Those are two very different interpretations of what quantitative reasoning is,
or should be.  The catalog version essentially includes three models,
one drawn from mathematics ("mathematical models and methods"), one drawn
from statistics (vague), and one drawn from computer science ("logic and
problem-solving paradigms").  In contrast, the course tag description
appears to focus only on the statistical model.  I find that concerning.
In some sense, it's as if someone had decided that the study of critical
reading had to be of English novels or that the study of creative
expression had to involve only the visual arts.

I'm also frustrated that while the catalog description focuses on learning
these topics for their own sake, the course tag description focuses on
learning quantitative reasoning as it serves other disciplines.  There's a
strong benefit to having students learn to reason in abstract domains.
As I've said way too many times, one central aspect of a liberal
arts education is challenging yourself to think in different ways.
In addition, none of the other tags describe a discipline as being in
service to others, at least as far as I can tell.

I have no idea whether the College intends to continue course tags after
our reaccreditation.  If so, I sincerely hope that Curriculum Committee
will revisit these tags.

Postscript: As I looked for quantitative reasoning in the [College Catalog](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=3765), I was reminded that we also have a second note about quantitative reasoning.

> The original seven liberal arts, in the classical world, consisted
of the trivium of deductive reasoning comprised of grammar, logic, and
rhetoric, and the quadrivium of quantitative reasoning, which encompassed
geometry, astronomy, arithmetic, and music. [9]

Once again, the things that are termed "quantitative reasoning" are very
different than what Grinnell's quantitative reasoning tag implies.  Of
course, I'm not sure that anyone other than Grinnell refers to them as
the "quadrivium of quantitative reasoning".  Most seem to call them
the "mathematical arts", the "mathematical sciences", or, perhaps, the
"quantitative arts".   But "quantitative reasoning"?  That's strange.

Postscript: In spite of my criticism of the quantitative reasoning tag
[10], I do think that the new study using the course tags has some
utility, particularly in the more nuanced approach to "hurdle rates"
that was embraced in the final version [11].  I do, however, worry that
by separating out "Interdisciplinary majors", we are calling too much
attention to the behavior of students in that one interdisciplinary major.
Given the focus of that major, I also have trouble believing that only
14.9% of the courses that students in that major typically take are
tagged "Societies, Cultures, Identities".  If that's really the case,
it strikes me that something is wrong with our methodology.

[1] Yes, I know that I have a fellowship this fall.  However, I did commit
to spending some time at Grinnell.  Since I'm generally on campus on Mondays
for department meetings, I tend to stay for faculty meetings, too.

[2] I've linked to the more recent of my musings about course tags.  There's
also [an older musing](course-tags-2017-09-09).  I may be spending too much
time thinking about tags.

[7] I was unable to find the list of course tags on the College's Web
site.  Terrifyingly enough, searching for "Grinnell College course tags"
leads too way too many links to my musings.  Let's hope that the external
evaluators don't attempt that search.

[8] Ah, it turns out that [the list of course
tags](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Assessment/Assessment_Committee_Meetings/Meeting_10.04.17/course%20tag%20definitions%20-%20approved%2002-09-16.pdf#search=course%20tags)
is hidden behind a password barrier on
[GrinCo](https://grinco.sharepoint.com).  When will the College learn
to embrace openness?

[10] I keep wanting to write "QR tag".  But that seems way too close to
"QR code".

[11] *Thank you* to the faculty members who were able to get the report
writers to embrace the idea of looking at 8 of 9 and 7 of 9 tags, rather
than just 9 of 9 tags.

Running code camps: Some background
===================================

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), rambly*

A few years ago, at about the time time that [Narren Brown](narren-brown)
had made the transition from one of the diversity offices on campus to
the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment, I asked him to help
me consider how we might support greater racial diversity in computer
science at Grinnell [1].  Our first target was CSC 151; I asked Narren
to sit in and observe my section for a semester to consider whether
there were ways we should change the course.  We had also planned some
followup interviews with students to learn more about what led them to
take the course or not to take the course and what led them to persist
or not to persist in the discipline.

At the end of the semester, after he had observed a variety of class
sessions, taken some video, and debriefed with me, Narren did not
have any significant suggestions for the class; he noted that most of
the pedagogical components of the course --- such as pair programming
with randomly assigned and regularly changing partners, blind grading,
encouragement of peer activities, and the use of cards to randomly call
on students --- represented approriately inclusive practices.

Then he said the words that changed the next four years of my life.  I 
think they were something like the following.

> Sam, if you really care about diversity in CS, waiting until students
get to Grinnell is too late.  By the way, did you know that there appear
to be no summer camps for middle schoolers in Iowa that teach them to
program? [2]

So we put together a multi-year plan for offering summer code camps that
built on research on diversity at the college level.  In particular, we
planned camps that focused on media computation and computing for social
good, two techniques that had shown great promise for recruiting and
retaining a more diverse group of students.  We put together a proposal
to the College's Innovation Fund and, after assuring the committee that
I was willing to treat the camps as my primary scholarly activity for the
period of the grant, we received funding.

The first summer, which was primarily for planning, went well.
My research students read around 60 papers about middle-school coding
experiences and looked at the Web sites for around 500 code camps.
We learned a lot of things through that process, including that there
seemed to be a large gap between what the literature recommends and
what "commercial" code camps offer.  We also found that almost no code
camps focused on computing for social good [3].  Based on their work,
the students designed and offered a "Creative Coding for Social Good"
camp in day-camp format.

Then Narren got lured away from Grinnell.  Since Narren was dealing with
most of the logistics [4], that meant that although I was willing to design
and offer camps, I did not feel ready to offer the residential camps that
we had planned for the second summer.  I was fortunate enough to convince
Sarah Dahlby Albright [5], our new peer education coordinator, to help run
the camps.  Sarah has a background in mathematics education; she's given
me and the research students endless insights on teaching the age groups.
Since it was her first summer, she also didn't feel ready to offer a 
residential camp.  So we planned day camps [6].  Sarah also runs an
after-school math club for girls in 3rd and 4th grade, so we decided to
see if we could leverage that group for an elementary-level camp.  In that
case, we rewrote the curriculum for the "Creative Coding" camp to be a
"Craft of Code" camp.  

As we had planned in the original grant proposal, our counselors also
developed and offered a "Data Science for Social Good" camp for middle-school
students.  You can read a bit more about it in [a news article from last
year](code-camp-article-2017-07-24).

Given not only how exhausted our counselors were at the end of each week,
but also the clear need to develop additional skillsets to support more
time with this age group, Sarah and I agreed that we probably could not
switch to an overnight camp mode for the third summer.

Changing from overnight to day camps makes it much harder to achieve
our initial goals of racial diversity.  Grinnell and the surrounding
communities are not nearly as racially diverse as, say Des Moines, and
with day camps we are not able to draw from as far away.  But we are
supporting other kinds of diversity.  Large numbers of girls are signing
up for the camps (about 50%) and we're seeing some economic diversity.
Just being on a college campus has made a difference to some students;
we're hearing some who might not have considered college now ask questions
about how they get ready for a place like Grinnell.  I consider that a big
win.

[1] If I recall correctly, that was when we had about 40% women majors and
before we had the enormous growth in numbers of major.

[2] Narren had been searching for such camps and had not found any.  I believe
there are now a variety of such camps.

[3] I thought their research paper reporting the results was clever and
useful.  Our reviewers did not feel the same way. We ended up presenting
the results as a poster. 

[4] People who know me know that I should not generally be the primary
contact for large-scale logistics.

[5] I should write a profile of Sarah soon.

[6] We offer day camps that run from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with drop-off
as early as 8:30 a.m. and pick up at 5:30 p.m. to support working parents.

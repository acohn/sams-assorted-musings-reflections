The term "cyberattack"
======================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), technology, short*

The other day, I was listening to NPR, and a
story came on about how [Microsoft had recently thwarted some
cyberattacks](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/21/640630592/microsoft-says-it-discovered-and-stopped-attempted-cyberattack-tied-to-russia).  I appreciate learning
about how the kinds of attacks that happened, so I listened with some
interest.  Were the attackers relying on a flaw in the Microsoft Windows
operating system or some server software?  Were the attackers using a
'bot net to try a host of passwords on a site?  Or was it some other
common approach?  Or perhaps one I  hadn't heard of before?

Then they got to the details.  Here's what I thought I heard: 

> The attackers set up Web sites the looked like the other sites and
with similar URLs to those sites.  Then they sent email to potential
targets with links to these sites.  Among other things, the targets
included conservative think-tanks.

That didn't sound to me like what I consider a cyberattack.  That
struck me as what I think of as phishing [1].  But phishing is mostly
a social attack, rather than a cyber attack; it relies on people not
paying enough attention or taking enough precautions.  In many ways,
it's like the phone spammers who call and say "This is your credit
card company; please enter your number so that we can fix them" or even
"This is Grinnell College; call us at 1-800-GrinCo1 to enter your
security deposit".

It's been bothering me, so tonight I went back and found [a transcript
of the story](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/21/640630592/microsoft-says-it-discovered-and-stopped-attempted-cyberattack-tied-to-russia).

> What they tried to do in this case was create domains and URLs that
looked like the groups they were trying to target for cyberattacks. So
here's how it would work. And it could happen to any of us. You'd receive
an email that has a URL. It directs you to a website that looks a lot
like your own office's website. And it asks for your passwords. This
happens all the time. But in this case, it happens - it happened with
these attempted targets - the U.S. Senate and two right-of-center think
tanks, the International Republican Institute and the Hudson Institute.

I guess I remembered correctly.  And I'm frustrated that Microsoft and
news organizations refer to something that is primarily a social attack
as a "cyberattack".  That term seems so much more threatening and
technologically sophisticated.  It's like the ways in the Russians used
Facebook to manipulate people; it's an attack using technology, but
the primary vector is social, not technological.  Both kinds of social
attacks are hugely problematic, and I'm glad that Microsoft caught this
one, but they're not what I would call a cyberattack.

Or do I just use terms differently?

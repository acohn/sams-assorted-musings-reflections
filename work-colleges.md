Work colleges
=============

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), Academia*

With the start of the new year, I've been trying to give myself a clean
slate.  I've once again declared inbox bankruptcy [1].  I've dusted off
my to-do list manager and thrown away most of the items on my lists.  But
a few caught my eye.  One said "Check how Paul Quinn College is handling
work study."  Usually, tasks like that come from my having read 
an article somewhere and realizing that I wanted to follow up on something
in the future.  Fortunately, I'd included a link to the article which
inspired the task.  Surprisingly, though, the article was titled
"[Online learning is misunderstood.  Here's how](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Online-Learning-Is/244173)".  

My first thought was "I wonder if I saved the wrong link."  My second
thought was "I wonder whether I linked to a page that changed."  But
I followed the link to the article on online learning and then searched
for "Paul Quinn".  Amazingly, the article (which is more of a collection
of "observations on the people and ideas reshaping the higher-education
landscape") includes the following note.

> While we’re on the subject of business models, consider how Paul Quinn College in Dallas (and as of last month, Plano) is upending work-study. It’s a creative approach that manages to both expand work opportunities for students and bring in additional revenue for the institution. [2]

Goldie Blumenstyk, the author of that article, provides a link to
[an expensive report from _Chronicle of Higher Education_](https://store.chronicle.com/collections/reports-guides/products/sustaining-the-college-business-model-how-to-shore-up-institutions-now-and-reinvent-them-for-the-future).
But most _Chronicle_ reports collect articles, so I went looking for
one.    It wasn't hard to find.  Scott Carlson wrote about Paul Quinn
in an article entitled "[A College Puts Students to Work, for Their Future
and Its Own](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-College-Puts-Students-to/190175)" [3,4].

The article begins

> There’s something romantic about the work college, harking back to the medieval monasteries that lit the way for Western higher education. At a work college, students learn not only in classrooms but also through jobs grand and lowly: tutoring peers, managing applications, mowing the grass, milking cows on the campus farm, cleaning toilets.

> ...

> This week Paul Quinn College, in Dallas, announced that it, too, would become a work college—making it the first urban and first historically black institution to do so.

In some ways, echoes what Grinnell says about, say, dining services (or
at least what I recall it saying).

So what makes something a "work school"?  I went to look at the work
schools consortium.  (At first, I did not see Berea in the list of work
schools; discovering that it was one helped a lot.)

my case, it means putting everything in my inbox in a separate archive
so I can still find it later.

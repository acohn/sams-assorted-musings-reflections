Grumpy
======

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), academia, rambly*

Today was not a good day.  It doesn't help that I'm utterly frustrated
by the state of my country, from what appears to be a completely biased
process for a completely biased candidate for the Supreme Court, to a
president who thinks it's okay to make jokes at the expense of a victim
of sexual assault, to the release of financial information about that
same president that we all know will make no difference at all to his
supporters [1].

Because I had meetings on campus today [2], I spent the day there.
And, for whatever reason, being at Grinnell puts me in contact with too
many things that make me upset.  I ended up complaining about a severe
breach of faculty governance.  And documenting that issue took time.
I keep thinking to myself, *Why does it have to be me who notices
and raises these issues?*  Yesterday, I had to deal once again with a
strange process by which our job ads get edited without either Council
or departmental approval.  I'm sick of having to worry about such things.

It doesn't help that two years have passed since Student Affairs mucked
with the PCard Privacy Policy, making it no longer applicable to faculty
and staff.  In fact, I raised my first concerns on October 3, 2016.
If the Dean's office can expect my department to come up with a thoughtful
approach to "Research Opportunities for All" in three months and then
to revise it in even less time because they changed the parameters,
why can't ITS develop (or restore) policies in a reasonable timeframe?
And it's not like it doesn't make a difference, there's already been one
clear case in which the revised policy appears to have permitted a severe
ethical violation [3,4].  *Why can't I let this damn issue drop?*
I don't know, but it keeps haunting me.

There are also the smaller things that were at the back of my mind and that
came to the forefront as I met with people today.  Why don't advisors have to
approve students switching to S/D/F [5]?  Why is it that we don't have the
chair of the first major sign a declaration of a second major?  Why do we
limit the essay that accompanies a declaration of major to 200 words [6]?

Then there are the things I heard about but decided not to respond to.
The one that most sticks in my mind is yet another example of someone
deciding to leave out a department on an announcement for no apparent reason.

The meetings, the emails, the frustrations, the administrative tasks that
should not be my responsibility, and more [7] ate away my day.  I should be
writing, not getting upset and spending my time on this stuff.  It doesn't
help that next week I have to be back on campus for at least two days [8].

Okay, deep breaths.  Let's think about the positives.  I helped a student
think through both study-abroad issues and a four-year plan.  And it's
one of those students who are very enthusiastic about getting a broad
liberal arts education.  That was fun.  I got to spend a few minutes
talking to one of my favorite junior colleagues, someone I haven't seen
much of recently.  I got to make them wince when I mentioned one of Middle
Son's new activities [9].  I saw an interesting panel with the Grinnell
Prize Winner, three alums, and another amazing colleague.  At the panel,
I sat next to an alum I haven't seen in a few months and two staff members
I particularly respect.  I got a free lunch.  I learned about another Grinnell
alum that everyone should know about [10].  I raised a concern about the
Web site and had it addressed.  I had time to muse.  Youngest son showed
me a wicked [11] hack.  And, maybe, I'll get to see _Saints Rest_ tonight.
I only wish they hadn't scheduled it at 9:00 p.m., or that they'd put
the time in the _Campus Memo_.

Whoops.  I'm going downhill again.  I think I'll stop now.  Suffice to say
that I'm grumpy today.

[1] I know that I've said that I would not generally discuss politics in the 
musings.  At this point, I can't help it. 

[2] One necessary department meeting blossomed into multiple meetings.

[3] Yes, I've said this before.  I'm getting close to the point that I will
write to the Dean and say "If you don't want me telling the _S&B_ about this
issue, get ITS to restore the old policy."  But I don't like making threats.

[4] Admittedly, it's not clear that the policy itself permitted the violation.
However, there was a severe ethical violation, and the policy and processes
did not prevent that violation.

[5] "Pass/Fail", in common parlance.

[6] I wonder if I'd get in trouble if I required all of my advisees to write
at least 500 words, including an explanation of *what* makes a strong liberal 
arts education.  I'm sick of "I checked all six boxes, so I have a good liberal
arts education".  I'm also sick of my inclination to ask students about checking
off those six boxes.

[7] I think I spent an hour each on SIGCSE and Wilson Center business.

[8] Monday is my standard day on campus.  I need to observe a class,
attend a Division meeting, and meet with students.  Thursday we have
external reviewers.  I'm going to do my best to avoid campus on Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Friday, even though I'd like to attend the Faculty Friday
lunchtime discussion of advising.

[9] I got someone else to wince, too.

[10] That may be tomorrow's musing.

[11] I'd written "cool hack".  Grammarly suggested "neat hack".  That's worse.
So I drew upon my New England roots and settled on "wicked".

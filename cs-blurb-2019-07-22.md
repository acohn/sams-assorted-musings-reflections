Advertising the department
==========================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia) [1], things I had to write
anyway.*

A few months ago, our Communications Department asked the academic
departments to write new blurbs about themselves for the Web site.
Our department, like many, neglected to fulfill our obligations.
And so Communications did what was probably appropriate: They wrote
one for us.  Here's what they came up with.

> Computer science

> Practical, theoretical, comprehensive, and rigorous

> Whether you want to study programming languages, hardware design,
operating systems, or more, the computer science major will teach you
the fundamentals and the theory. You’ll learn all aspects of the
design and use of computers through engaging, innovative teaching in
outstanding facilities. Have a special project in mind? You’ll have
plenty of opportunities for independent research guided by our expert
faculty. And you’ll be thoroughly prepared for graduate study or
a career in network and database administration, systems analysis,
computer science, technical roles, and independent contracting.

One of my colleagues did not respond positively, to put it nicely.
Why not?  Well, we don't really do hardware, and we don't talk about the
design of computers [3,4].  Our facilities are good, but it's a stretch
to call them "outstanding" [5].  We shouldn't advertise a willingness to
supervise special projects that students have in mind.  We support a lot
of student-faculty research, but most of it is either (a) grounded in a
faculty member's primary research area or (b) related to a course [6].
My colleague also objected to "network and database administration", since
it's not a career that we target or that many of our students pursue.

Do I blame Communications for these issues?  Nope.  We didn't do our
job in writing the blurb and we did not communicate our department's
strengths to them.  It seems to me that Communications also has not
gotten appropriate support from the Dean's office on the "Opportunities
for all students to do research" initiative [7]. Ideally, we would have a
blurb describing those opportunities for each department.  After all,
departments had to write those descriptions two years ago [8,9].

Communications also did some nice things.  I particularly appreciate
the four-word summary: _Practical, theoretical, comprehensive, and
rigorous_.  I might want to add _inclusive_.  And they do include our
innovative teaching practices, which I consider one of the department's
core strengths.

At this point, it's the department's responsibility to come up with
something better.  I cleverly volunteered to draft the first response
[10,11].  It ended up on my back burner, but it's time to get something
done.  And there's nothing like musing to help.  So, here goes [14].

What does our [current blurb](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/computer-science) say?

> Computer science study at Grinnell is innovative — you experience varied pedagogical and problem-solving approaches. It’s comprehensive, involving several programming languages and a balance of theory and application. It’s thorough — guided by national curricular guidelines and taught in dedicated facilities. It offers extensive opportunities for student-faculty research, and can prepare you for further study or careers in network and database administration, systems analysis, computer science, technical roles, and independent contracting. [15]

Yeah, I can see where Communications might want to rewrite it.  I also see where
they got the four words.  And it has the network and database administration
part.  So, what can I do?  I'll start by reflecting on some strengths.

* An innovative curriculum, based on three core approaches:
  active learning in most courses, a multi-paradigm introductory
  sequence, and research experiences in the upper-level courses 
  [18].
* A curriculum that is acknowledged as an exemplar in the IEEE/ACM
  Curricula guidelines [19].
* A variety of experiences for "outside of classroom" learning, including
  not just MAPs, but also student-driven activities like AppDev or the
  VR club.
* A commitment to an inclusive curriculum.
* We also have awesome faculty, but I think most departments would
  claim that.

The blurbs, current and suggested, also seem to have a focus on 
post-graduation opportunities.  I'll need to think about a way to
address that.  And, particularly since one of the themes of the
institution is that your major does not define your career, I'll
want to incorporate that.  Well, here goes nothing.

> Computer science

> Practical, theoretical, comprehensive, reflective, inclusive and rigorous

> Whether you want to build problem-solving skills, pursue
graduate work, or explore a career in one of the wide variety of
computing-related fields, Grinnell's computer science major will ground
you in the fundamentals and the underlying theory.  The department's
curriculum, identified as just one of four international exemplars
by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), explores multiple modes
of thinking and requires students to reflect not just on the study
of CS, but also the implications of computing in the broader world.
Through innovative approaches to teaching and a variety of activities
designed to support students, the department strives to make computing
more inclusive.  Whether it's building software for a local non-profit,
exploring a multi-week innovative project in an upper-level course, or
conducting novel research with a faculty member, Grinnell provides you
with the opportunity to build your learning beyond traditional homework
assignments and exams.  When you finish, you'll find that the ways of
thinking and problem-solving skills you've gained will prepare you for a
host of rewarding careers.  While many of our graduates pursue careers
in computing, from app development to consulting, from management to
computer animation, from data science to data management, others are
equally comfortable applying those skills to very different careers.

Do I want to list some of those other careers? There are many. I'm just
as proud of our graduates who have gone on to be teachers, comedians,
fundraisers, mathematicians, stay-at-home parents, and so on and so forth.
But I probably shouldn't add those; the paragraph is too long already.

Given that the paragraph is too long, I should consider editing it.
But, well, my Chair did promise that if I drafted something, he would
do the rest.  So I'll leave it at that, at least for today.

[1] I was surprised that I didn't have a "department" page in
the host of indices I've created for this site.  I settled on academia
as the closest.  I have too many indices already.  And I should probably
generate them automatically.  But that's a task for a site redesign,
which is getting more and more intimidating the more musings I write [2].

[2] Or is that "the more I muse and rant"?

[3] It's questionable whether or not we talk about the "use" of computers,
either.

[4] I suppose we talk about the design of computers in our course in
organization and architecture.  But it's not the focus of
our curriculum.

[5] We've had at least one prospective student write to us and ask
something like, "Your computers aren't as old as they look in the photos,
are they?"  And no, they are not.  But it looks like we're sticking with
a one-monitor-per-workstation set up for the near future, and we don't
need particularly fancy machines or monitors for our primary teaching.

[6] The range of projects from Weinman's recent course in Computer Vision
is astounding.  So, in some sense, students got to pick a "passion project"
of sorts.  But it was restricted to something related to computer vision.

[7] That's right, Sam. Pass the blame.

[8] My preference would be that the general aspects of each department's
research opportunities appear in the College Catalog, as our requirements
for honors do.

[9] I believe that one of the Associate Deans plans to work on this issue.
Thanks!

[10] Yes, I realize that I'm on leave.  But no one else volunteered, and
our Chair has way too much on his plate.

[11] Our Chair and I also seem to have a relatively good writing
relationship in which I draft something, and he cleans it up.  I feel
like I often develop that relationship with folks [12].

[12] That was also the relationship that Janet and I had in writing
the CSC 151 materials.  I do not envy her work in checking my accuracy
and reframing my thinking.

[14] That may be one of the longest introductions I've written, particularly
with regards to ratio of the length of the introduction to the length of
the piece of writing.  And I have more to write before I write, as it were.

[16] At least that's what the page info says.  I wonder if, under Drupal, 
the page modification date ends up being the time you view the page.

[17] It seems odd to refer to that page for the text, given that I anticipate
that the page will change.  I would be tempted to refer to the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) URL, <https://web.archive.org/web/20190207020321/https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/computer-science>, but
that version is strangely formatted.

[18] That last bit is not all that innovative, but it's a valuable
part of our curriculum.

[19] I know that this characteristic is one of the reasons we were able
to attract one of my favorite students, even though they had initially
decided not to attend Grinnell.

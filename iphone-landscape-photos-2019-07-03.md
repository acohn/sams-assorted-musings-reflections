Landscape photos from my iPhone
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

Yesterday, I posted [a musing that involved a few landscape
photographs](office-cleaning-2019-07-02).  I'd taken the photos on
my iPhone [1].  I'd forgotten about the potential problems involved.
Since the volume buttons on the iPhone serve as camera buttons, I tend
to take landscape photos with the buttons up.  Through the magic of
technology, my iPhone seems to know what side is up.  Surprisingly,
though, almost everything else seems to display them upside-down.

I haven't done enough research on the topic [3].  As I understand it,
because the lens is toward the bottom of the camera when you take
landscape photos like I did, they are, in fact, upside down.  However,
the iPhone adds some metadata to indicate that it should be flipped.

That sounds reasonable, right?  However, not everything reads that
metadata.  When I first put the jpegs in the musing, they appeared
upside-down in my browser.  So I used
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) [4] to rotate them 180 degrees.
That made them appear correctly in my browser.  I thought I was done.

But it's technology.  And technology creates problems.  When I posted the
musing to Facebook, the image appeared upside-down again.  It was
right-side-up in my Mac browser, but upside-down in my iPhone browser [6].

Have I mentioned that *I hate computers*?

Eventually, I was able to solve the problem by converting the image to
png format.  There's probably a better solution.  However, I'm too lazy
to search the InterWeb for more information.

Maybe in the future, I'll remember the correct orientation for iPhone
photos.  Or maybe I'll just remember to convert to png [7].

Postscript: Since the musing was about cleaning my office and its 
implications, it was almost funny that the photos are upside-down.
At least one reader suggested that I cleaned my office by inverting
it over a dumpster [8].

[1] I still use an iPhone 5S.  I realize that the technology is nearly
six years old.  But it gets the job done.  And, because of Apple's
"Battery Replacement" process [2], my iPhone 5S is relatively new.

[2] "It's too much effort to replace the battery.  We'll just give you
a new phone."  YMMV.

[3] It didn't seem like it was worth the effort.

[4] ImageMagick is an awesome command-line tool for manipulating images.
One of my goals for sabbatical is to learn it better [5].

[5] Yes, I realize that I have way too many goals for sabbatical.

[6] And on Facebook.

[7] I expect that I will remain too lazy to search the InterWeb.

[8] Or something similar.

In the midst of this time, I'm finding it valuable to think back
on some unexpected joys I've experienced.  There are a lot.  As I
mentioned recently, even something that seems as basic as seeing
my peers' faces in a class discussion or faculty meeting [1] brought
great joy.  One other that comes to mind this evening happened what
feels like eons ago, but was just a few weeks back in late February
when I was visiting Youngest Son at Stanford for Family Weekend.

We got to spend a lot of time with YS when visiting: Time with him was an
expected pleasure; the amount we got was unexpected.  After all, he has
a quite busy schedule [2].  When he wasn't available, Michelle and
I wandered around a bit.  As we were walking back to his dorm, we
noticed a little park and I decided to take a shortcut through it.
Once inside, I discovered sculpture.  More precisely, sculptures.
Really interesting sculptures.  Fortunately, there were some
descriptive signs.  It turns out that about twenty-five years ago,
Stanford invited ten master carvers from Papua New Guinea to visit
campus and to spend time sculpting.  It sounds like they were
appropriately compensated.

We were in a rush to meet Daniel, so we only got a quick visit at first.
But the next time we had free time, I was able to sit in the park and
take in some of the work in more depth.  I appreciate that Michelle
was willing to put up with my desire to sit in a somewhat chilly spot
to look and reflect [3].

I appreciated the wide variety of forms, their use of both wood and
stone, and the peace of the space.  I was stunned by the number
that the artists were able to create in a relatively short time.
I was also happy to know that the pieces were crafted there, rather
than acquired from elsewhere.

I particularly appreciate that the Papua New Guineans did a few riffs
on some of the Rodin sculptures that they saw in Stanford's Rodin
Sculpture Garden [4].  I particularly liked the different perspective
on how one might represent a thinker.

It was a bit chilly in the park, so we didn't get to sit as long
as I would have liked.  But the time I had there was well worth it.
It was a wonderful, and unexpected, pleasure.  Who would have thought
that less than a month later, that wonderful space---and so many
like it---would be off limits.

Still, art persists.  It will be there long after the pandemic ends.
I look forward to visiting it again.  Let's hope it's soon.  Maybe
I'll get a few hours.

[1] Yes, that's right, I'm both a student and a faculty member this
semester.

[2] He is, after all, a Rebelsky.

[3] Thanks love!

[4] Youngest and I visited that when he was looking at colleges.  I much
prefer the setting of the other sculptures.  On the other hand, it would
have been warmer in the Rodin park.

Slow Internet connections
=========================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short, rambly*

This past week, I've been on vacation with my wonderful wife.  In
spite of [my workaholic tendencies](workaholic-2018-02-10), I went
on a cruise with her.  Perhaps I'll write about my experience with
the cruise in a separate musing.  For today, I'm writing about my
experience with Internet on the cruise.

We purchased an "Internet Value Package", which is supposed to give
you access to your email, news, Web sites, and such; just no
streaming.  It appears that Carnival interprets access differently
than I do.  While the list of messages would eventually appear on
my phone, when I clicked on any individual message, it would take
over a minute to load [1].  I could never get my full mailbox to
load on my laptop; it just seemed to give up after awhile.

As you might expect, it made it hard to work and it made it hard
to muse [2].  And boy, was the Internet connection slow.  _Sam, how
slow was it?_ Let's see ... While writing this, I was trying to
connect to <https://passwordreset.grinnell.edu> in my Web broswer
because I was having trouble with getting email [3].  This time, I
did time things.  After five minutes, the page still had not loaded
[4].  I don't consider that a useful connection.

To make it worse, some services treat you worse when you have a slow
Internet connection.  I was logging in to Amazon to download a Kindle
book.  It appears that I typed in the password before the page had
fully loaded.  So Amazon shot back with "For your security, we want
you to type both your password and the letters that appear in the
image below."  But, well, if I have a slow Internet connection, adding
steps to the page load means I'm even less likely to be able to log in.

Working in our room was worse.  If I worked on my phone, the Internet
connection seemed to drop every five minutes or so.  Things would
be working fine [4] and then suddenly I'd see "No Internet Connection"
on my phone.  I assume something similar was happening on my laptop,
but it was less verbose about dropping and regaining the Internet
connection.

I did have to get some real work done this week.  I think I spent
an hour on the code camps, an hour or more dealing with GHC and
Tapia tasks, and an hour or two dealing with miscellaneous
administrative email.  GHC and Tapia would probably have taken
thirty minutes with a real Internet connection.  The other two hours
would probably have taken twenty minutes.

Is there a moral to all this?  Here are mine.

* Don't trust cruise Internet connections.
* If you must use a cruise Internet connection, buy the most expensive.
  I didn't pay for the "streaming" service since I didn't plan on streaming.
  But

[1] I didn't time.  It was just clear that it was a long time.

[2] I'll muse separately about [musing while cruising](musing-while-cruising).

[2] Years of working as a sysadmin on an old Unix box has some benefits.
I learned to line edit, and slow `vi` is a lot like a line editor.

[3] That is, I kept getting "please reenter your password" messages, which
is generally a sign that my account has been accidentally locked by Grinnell's
security policies and needs to be unlocked.

[4] Admittedly, I was also trying to open the Amazon home page at the
same time.

[5] Or at least as "fine" as they were working.

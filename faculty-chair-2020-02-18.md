About a month ago, I wrote about [the then-upcoming election of the
chair of the faculty](faculty-chair-2020-01-23).  I'm fortunate: I
was not elected; I was not even nominated.  We had two excellent
candidates.  I'm glad to say that I can soon say "The Chair of the
Faculty is a VP" [1].  I expect that the new Chair will do an awesome
job and will represent us well.

Why am I musing about this topic?  I'm not completely sure.  I'd
written it down in my physical notebook, and my family made fun of
me, claiming that I had written "Chair of Poultry".  In case you're
wondering why, it may help if I remind you that I described my
writing in [my manuscript for ENG-207](eng207-1b-manuscript) as
something like "Hieroglyphs, scrawled by a left-handed doctor after
three nights of call and five pots of coffee, using a pen that is
running out of ink. 

What else is in those notes?  Let's see ... Oh, yeah, there's one
of my brags.  I think it goes like this: One full professor's name,
other than Anne's and Raynard's, was missing from the original list.
Being me, I observed the absence and reported it [2].  it turned out
that someone had failed to record them correctly in one of the
central College databases.  It appears that being a PITA has a
positive effect once in a while.

There's a bit more.  Like most jobs on campus, the Faculty Chair's
job has gotten much more difficult over the years.  I recall trying
to convince Russell that the chair needed a 3-course release when
I was last on Council, more than a decade ago.  I'm glad it's finally
happened.  Thanks so much to everyone involved!  I'm glad to see
that Executive Council was able to work with Raynard and Anne to
increase the course releases and compensation for the Chair of the
Faculty.  Let's see.

> With thanks to Executive Council and the Dean’s Office for their
engagement with the Chair of Faculty position, I write to confirm
and expand the support for the Chair of the Faculty position:
continuing support includes a 3-course equivalent reassignment from
teaching to the work of the Chair, to be divided out over the two
semesters of an academic year, as well as support from the Dean’s
Office administrative staff; expanded support will be provided in
a stipend each summer for work done by the Chair.

That's wonderful.  I hope that it permits Chair VP [3] the time necessary
to serve well in the role without being overwhelmed.  Plus, it will give
them more time to read all the suggestions I'll send via email.

[1] Our new Chair, with the initials, V.P. told me that they were glad
that I could make a joke at their expense.

[2] For extra credit, figure out who it is.

[3] Or VP Chair [4].

[4] Nope, I don't know when to stop.

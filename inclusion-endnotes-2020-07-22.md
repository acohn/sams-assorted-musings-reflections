In [my latest musing](inclusion-2020-07-22), I wrote a long public
letter to Grinnell's president and Chief Diversity Officer.  As I
reached the end of the draft, I realized that I'd been using endnotes,
fewer endnotes than I normally use, but endnotes nonetheless.  The
endnotes seemed inappropriate for the letter, even if I"m directing
those recipients to a Web page.  But I can't bear to throw things
away, so I have moved them here.

Let's see if I can remember the context.

After discussing a pair of troublesome terms in CS, I suggested
that "I can identify many other problematic terms and approaches
in the history of CS, but itâ€™s not worth going into more depth
here."  Endnote [1] annotates this comment.

In discussing my opposition to the term "brand", I wrote "those
complaints were ignored".  Endnote [2] was intended to annotate the
comment.  It is both honest and problematic.

Endnote [3] was intended for the discussion of the terror of the
Honor G.  I ended up incorporating it in the text.

Yup, I kept myself more in control.  I'm not sure that I did so in
the longer musing, but I was frustrated.  And, as I've told my
Tutorial students, too-long letters now seem to Grinnell's newest
tradition [4].

**_Postscript_**: I should also have added a postscript of the form

> [English Teacher], I apologize.  You taught me to write better
than this letter suggests.  My time was limited and I considered
it important to get the ideas out in a timely and public fashion.
I can't promise that I will do better next time, but I will do my
best to consider the principles and practices you helped me
learn.

**_Postscript_**: I also should have included an introductory note.
Something of the form 

> I was trying to use this week to write notes of appreciation.
But it seemed I needed to respond to President Harris' letter sooner
rather than later.  I hope I can return to the notes soon.

[1] in an old language design manual that I had students read.  In
discussing the different kinds of data you might record for people,
the author notes that while they would have strings for first name
and last name, they would use three numbers in the record for women
but not for men.  Negotiating the complexity of describing why someone
would associate three numbers with a woman while still acknowledging
the harm reading about it might cause was a challenge, but one that
I think my students appreciated.

[2] I was going to write "fell on deaf ears", but that is also a slur.

[3] No, I am not calling for the banning of the Honor G.

[4] Perhaps that should have been an endnote to the original.  Perhaps
a Postscript.

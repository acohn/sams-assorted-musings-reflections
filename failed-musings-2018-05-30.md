You can't always write what you want
====================================

*Topics/tags: [Writing](index-writing), short*

Tonight has not been a good night for musing.  I ended the day with
a lot of ideas for a follow-up essay to [my notes on creating new
letterhead](joc-letterhead).  While that essay had ended on a positive
note [1], I encountered a host of other issues.  But, well, that was
a nontrivial musing and I had a lot of preparation to do for [game
night](game-night-2017-08-02) this week.  Game night also went late;
folks stayed until a bit after 11:00 p.m., and I stayed up with them.
Even though I did start to write a bit while they were finishing up,
I didn't have the time or energy for the revised letterhead musing.

Before I came up with the fonts and formatting topic, I had been planning
to spend some of today working on my notes for a panel I'm participating
in tomorrow.  I figured those notes should become a musing.  I did
develop a few rough notes and ideas.  But I realized that I should not
post a full musing on the panel until after I participate in the panel.
So they remained as rough notes [2].

Instead, I picked up a musing that I've been working on once in a
while for the past few weeks.  It's a longer-than-normal musing,
currently at about 2500 words.  I made some progress on it, but I had
trouble [wrapping up](wrapping-up), perhaps because it's late at night.
However, when a musing is that long, I like to have a solid ending.  I
also like to revisit it to edit.  So, even though I made some progress
on that musing, I did not finish it.

But my goal remains to muse every day.  So I went through the list of
potential "quick musing topics".  My muse appears to be in a bad mood
[3]; she [4] quickly rejected each of the five or so I considered.

It's after 11:30.  When I reach this point, I normally write about
my experience of "muser's block".  But that's not quite the right
term.  I was able to write [5]; I just couldn't finish writing anything
I started.

But then our family's motto came to mind.  Or at least a variant thereof.
To paraphrase the Glimmer twins [6], "You can't always write what
you want.  But sometimes you might just find you write what you need."
Perhaps I needed a night to just write about my experiences writing.
Perhaps I just needed to write something quick.

Thanks Mick and Keith.

[1] And even continued on a positive note; my contact in Communications
generally liked my custom letterhead.

[2] I'll need to make them much smoother before the panel.

[3] Or perhaps my failure at the other two musings put my muse in a
bad mood.

[4] I've forgotten, do I gender my muse?  I think so.

[5] I even took some notes for the musing that is tentatively entitled
"Frustrated with fonts and formatting".

[6] No relation to Glimmer labs.

"Sam, you are on too many mailing lists!"
=========================================

While I was working on the mailbox zero project, one of my friends said
something to me like "Sam, I think you're on too many mailing lists.
You should unsubscribe."  But I garner valuable information from the
mailing lists.  I'm also a "push" person rather than a "pull" person.
So let's consider what I subscribe to.  (I'm not going to include things
like Pact Publishing, Oxford University Press, or even StackSocial, which
are companies of dealt with.  I don't think of myself as having "subscribed".)

Most of the mailing lists are professional.

* racket-users, a mailing list for people who use the Racket programming
  language.  I mostly subscribe to see what people are chatting about,
  and for important announcements, and can quickly delete most messages.
* SIGCSE-members and SIGCSE-announce, the mailing lists for the Special
  Interest Group in Computer Science Education.  I also moderate these
  lists.  It's my professional society, and there's great discussion of
  all sorts of issues in CS education.
* SIGCIS-members, the mailing list for folks who do history of computing.
  I learn a lot from this list.
* SIGCAS-members, the mailing list for the special interest group
  on Computers and Society.  Usually pretty quiet.
* Internet Patent News.  About once per week.  Usually skim and save.
* ACM TechNews  A few times a week.  Skim and delete.
* Risks.  A few times a week.  Skim and save.
* _Chronicle_.  Daily.  Skim and delete.

A few are for fun or expanding my knowledge

* Keith Knight.
* Audities.  Rare.
* Straight Dope.  Weekly.  Amusing.
* Salon.com.  Daily.  I need to get some liberal extremism from somewhere.
* Portside moderator.  Daily.  Even more extremism.  I tend to skim these.

And then there are two related to Grinnell

* Grinnell Parents
* Grinnell Family

Wow, that is a lot!

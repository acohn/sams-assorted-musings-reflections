"Sam, you are on too many mailing lists!"
=========================================

While I was working on the mailbox zero project, one of my friends said
something to me like "Sam, I think you're on too many mailing lists.
You should unsubscribe."  Of course, they said this while they had a
Twitter reader up on their screen, with lots of feeds.  Why do I
subscribe to so many mailing lists?  Mostly because I garner valuable
information from the mailing lists.  I'm also a "push" person rather
than a "pull" person [1].  So let's consider what I subscribe to [2].

Most of the mailing lists are professional.

* racket-users, a mailing list for people who use the Racket programming
  language.  I mostly subscribe to see what people are chatting about,
  and for important announcements, and can quickly delete most messages.
* SIGCSE-members and SIGCSE-announce, the mailing lists for the Special
  Interest Group in Computer Science Education.  I also moderate these
  lists.  It's my professional society, and there's great discussion of
  all sorts of issues in CS education.
* SIGCIS-members, the mailing list for folks who do history of computing.
  I learn a lot from this list.
* SIGCAS-members, the mailing list for the special interest group
  on Computers and Society.  Usually pretty quiet.
* Internet Patent News.  About once per week.  Usually skim and save.
* ACM TechNews  A few times a week.  Skim and delete.
* Risks.  A few times a week.  Skim and save.
* _Chronicle_.  Daily.  Skim and delete.
* Teaching Open Source.  Rarely.
* BetaSaaSers. 
* CRA Bulletin.  Weekly or so.  Skim.
* NSF Bulletin.  (It's where I saw the program that eventually led to GSP
  getting a presidential award.)

A few are for fun or expanding my knowledge

* Keith Knight.
* Audities.  Rare.
* Straight Dope.  Weekly.  Amusing.
* Salon.com.  Daily.  I need to get some liberal extremism from somewhere.
* Portside moderator.  Daily.  Even more extremism.  I tend to skim these.
* Etsy.  Every week or two.
* AMA Newsletter (and no, that's not the American Medical Association;
  it's something like Arts Media Agency).  Even though I'm not a high-end
  art collector, I like seeing what kinds of things they think such
  collectors are interested in.  A recent issue had a "DATA: Robert
  Rauschenberg" section that tracks things like number of exhibitions
  by type and the number of articles written about him, as well as
  data about distribution of recent sales.

And then there are at least three related to Grinnell

* Campus Memo
* Grinnell Parents
* Grinnell Family

Finally, there's one I don't know how to classify.

* Proofpoint End User Digest.  Daily.  Proofpoint likes to tell me what
  it considers borderline spam.  About 25% is mail that I want to receive.

Wow, that is a lot!

[1] That means that I prefer to have things sent to me, rather than to seek
them out.  I'm rarely on Facebook or Twitter.

[2] I'm not going to include things like Pact Publishing, Oxford
University Press, Lands End, or even StackSocial, which are companies from
whom I have purchased something and who therefore feel obligated to send
me regular email, since I don't think of myself as having "subscribed"
to their mailings.  I'm also not going to include the various musicians
who send me email because I've bought their music online.

SamR's musing sketchbook for 2020
=================================

_This document serves as my "sketchbook" of potential musings and
rants for 2020.   It's where I put notes on those musings.  Since
it's an electronic document, it will change regularly.  When I
finish a musing, it tends to disappear from the sketchbook._

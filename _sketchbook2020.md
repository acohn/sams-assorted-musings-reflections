SamR's musing sketchbook for 2020
=================================

_This document serves as my "sketchbook" of potential musings and
rants for 2020.   It's where I put notes on those musings.  Since
it's an electronic document, it will change regularly.  For example,
when I finish a musing, it tends to disappear from the sketchbook;
sometimes some traces remain._

_The document also tends to contain other notes related to the musings
and rants, such as a potential schedule of musing (one I rarely hold
to) and a list of software that I want to write._

Short
-----

1. "The Champagne of Beers".  What does that mean?  It's not like
they've called it the "Lafite Rothchild of beers".  Do they mean
that it's carbonated?  Most beer is carbonated.  Do they mean that
it's made in the Champagne region of France?  (Yes, I realize that
Champagne is supposed to be fancy.  But it's an odd metaphor.)

1. Choosing a book for Rebelsky Reading Group, Revisited.  I spent
the remainder of Winter break reading books.  _The Starless Sea_.
Some Howard Frank Mosher.  What else?

1. Academia.edu.  I keep getting messages from Academia.edu.  "The
name Samuel Rebelsky was mentioned in an influential paper" and
things like that.  Unfortunately, it's one of those baiting things;
you have to pay to find out more.  But I've always been surprised
at how often I get those messages.  Today, I went to look for one
of the things I was mentioned in, since there seemed to be enough
detail.  It turns out that the citation that mentioned my name was
as follows. "C. Karagiannidis and D. Sampson. Accommodating learning
styles in adaptation logics for personalised learning systems. In
P. Barker and S. Rebelsky, editors, Proceedings of World Conference
on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications 2002,
pages 1715â€“1726, Denver, Colorado, USA, 2002. AACE."  So it turns
out that I'm not being cited; the proceedings I edited are being
cited.

1. Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.

Long
----

1. The memo about Tutorial/Open Curriculum.  (Maybe a short one and a
long one.)

1. For Mike: Teaching CS.

1. How do I introduce the end-of-month musings?  Collect all of the introductions
and then reflect on them.  "At the end of each month, I write a musing that
reflects back on the past month of musing and ranting.  As I 
[noted recently](another-month-2020-01), I often feel challenged to write
the first paragraph, as I'm saying more-or-less the same thing I've said
every month.  Nonetheless, I do write each paragraph anew.  I wonder if I
can learn something about my writing from reading through them."

1. Caps on special topics courses.

1. Course caps.  I wonder how I should look at the data?  I wonder if
anyone else has looked at the data?  How do we classify courses?

1. GrinnellPlans: Early experiments in Social Media.

1. Transitioning Web sites.

1. Adventures in Racket Autograding.

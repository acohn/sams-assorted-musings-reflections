SamR's musing sketchbook for 2020
=================================

_This document serves as my "sketchbook" of potential musings and
rants for 2020.   It's where I put notes on those musings.  Since
it's an electronic document, it will change regularly.  For example,
when I finish a musing, it tends to disappear from the sketchbook;
sometimes some traces remain._

_The document also tends to contain other notes related to the musings
and rants, such as a potential schedule of musing (one I rarely hold
to) and a list of software that I want to write._

Tentative sequence of upcoming musings
--------------------------------------

* MLK Day
* Games at the Rebelskys'

1. "The Champagne of Beers".  What does that mean?  It's not like
they've called it the "Lafite Rothchild of beers".  Do they mean
that it's carbonated?  Most beer is carbonated.  Do they mean that
it's made in the Champagne region of France?  (Yes, I realize that
Champagne is supposed to be fancy.  But it's an odd metaphor.)

1. Interviewing at conferences.  For many years, many disciplines have
relied on their primary conferences as a venue for interviewing 
prospective faculty.  MLA.  CS has never relied on them (at least not
in my time as a professional).  When I asked an older economist whether
they had made changes, I was surprised at their reaction: "The cost
of attending a conference is small compared to the cost of graduate
education; it shouldn't be a problem."  I tried to convince them that
travel plus hotel (even a shared AirBNB) is a burden to many folks,
but they were insistent.  Then I talked to a younger economist.  It turns
out the econ is much like CS; the number of open positions outstrips
the number of candidates.  Hence, while it may cost a bit to attend
the conference, it has a clear payoff.  That's in stark contrast to the
MLA meeting, in which the odds of landing a job seem surprisingly slim.

1. The Fiboacci Spiral.  Damian Hirst, Intelletual Property, and
my Final Project for Sculpture.

1. Choosing a book for Rebelsky Reading Group, Revisited.  I spent
the remainder of Winter break reading books.  _The Starless Sea_.
Some Howard Frank Mosher.  What else?

1. Academia.edu.  I keep getting messages from Academia.edu.  "The
name Samuel Rebelsky was mentioned in an influential paper" and
things like that.  Unfortunately, it's one of those baiting things;
you have to pay to find out more.  But I've always been surprised
at how often I get those messages.  Today, I went to look for one
of the things I was mentioned in, since there seemed to be enough
detail.  It turns out that the citation that mentioned my name was
as follows. "C. Karagiannidis and D. Sampson. Accommodating learning
styles in adaptation logics for personalised learning systems. In
P. Barker and S. Rebelsky, editors, Proceedings of World Conference
on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications 2002,
pages 1715â€“1726, Denver, Colorado, USA, 2002. AACE."  So it turns
out that I'm not being cited; the proceedings I edited are being
cited.

1. Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.

1. Today's Grinnell photo.  Some time in the past semester, I started
a habit of taking a photo of something I noticed on campus and posting
it to Facebook with a caption, along with the phrase "Today's Grinnell
Photo".  I was a bit snarky at first, particularly given that they were
doing all sorts of strange construction across the street from my new
office.  But I think my photos have been generally positive.  A few get
staged, such as when I build an art project.  But most are just a reaction
to something I've seen.  Helps me look more closely.

1. Departmental honors. (departmental-honors-...)

1. For Mike: Teaching CS.

1. How do I introduce the end-of-month musings?  Collect all of the introductions
and then reflect on them.  "At the end of each month, I write a musing that
reflects back on the past month of musing and ranting.  As I 
[noted recently](another-month-2020-01), I often feel challenged to write
the first paragraph, as I'm saying more-or-less the same thing I've said
every month.  Nonetheless, I do write each paragraph anew.  I wonder if I
can learn something about my writing from reading through them."

1. Caps on special topics courses.

1. Course caps.  I wonder how I should look at the data?  I wonder if
anyone else has looked at the data?  How do we classify courses?

1. GrinnellPlans: Early experiments in Social Media.

1. Transitioning Web sites.

1. Adventures in Racket Autograding.

SamR's musing sketchbook for 2020
=================================

_This document serves as my "sketchbook" of potential musings and
rants for 2020.   It's where I put notes on those musings.  Since
it's an electronic document, it will change regularly.  For example,
when I finish a musing, it tends to disappear from the sketchbook;
sometimes some traces remain._

_The document also tends to contain other notes related to the musings
and rants, such as a potential schedule of musing (one I rarely hold
to) and a list of software that I want to write._

Tentative sequence of upcoming musings
--------------------------------------

* Blurb
* Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day
* Cool friends (Rachel Rose)
* Presidential search open forum
* Games at the Rebelskys'

Software to write
-----------------

1. Add blurb to the head.  (Is this conceptual or actual?)

1. 'liquify' script to add the heading to prior musings.

1. Script to find unmentioned musings.

1. Move indices to separate directory. 

1. `survey` script to take a list of musings (a list of dates?) and
summarize the contents.

1. Move scripts to bin.

1. Generate the one-liner for the indices.

1. Share code between bin/make-item and bin/index

Written, need minor revisions
-----------------------------

1. The joy of code: Concise perl.

1. Donation fantasies.

1. My Apple Watch (my-apple-watch)

1. Composting (composting-2020-02-xx)

1. Depression (depression-2019-12-12)

Written, need major revisions
-----------------------------

1. Getting things right - Faculty handbook (faculty-handbook-2019-08-28).

1. Bookstore gift cards (bookstore-gift-cards-2019-11-xx)

1. Practica Policies (practica-policies-2019-10-xx.md).  This
will evolve into "Learning about Lessons", or something like that.

1. Lost to the kerf.  (lost-to-the-kerf.md)

Short
-----

1. Searching for the next president.  (Grinnell, Rants)  
(presidential-search-forum-2020-01-xx).  

1. mailto links. (mailto-2020-02-xx.md)

1. Commas and conjunctions.  I want the comma with dependent clauses,
not with independent ones.  But it's the other way around.  Do I like
the comma with the dependent clause because it feels like an appositive
or an aside?  On hand, when they are independent, it feels like they 
are of equal value, and don't need the comma.  I wonder why the conventions
developed.

1. Learning from my email.  The other day, USPS noted that they
would be happy to send me photos of some of my email before I
received (on the day I was to receive it), something they call
[informed delivery](https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.action).  I thought I'd only get
photos of packages and registered mail and such.  But it appears
that I get photos of almost all of my mail.  I'm pretty sure that they're
not taking photos as an extra service; rather they are just forwarding
along the photos that they have already taken.  My quick search for
information on security issues revealed [some concerns about the ability
to sign up to get someone else's email](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/usps-informed-delivery-is-stalkers-dream/).  But my concern is more who has
access to the photos.  Can the police or FBI access them without a warrant?
[The USPS FAQ](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/Informed-Delivery-Privacy-Security-Concerns) says nothing about that.  [The Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_Delivery) says that "he Postal Service adheres to the privacy requirements of the Privacy Act established by the federal government which controls when and how the USPS shares personal information and limits the conditions in which that information can be disclosed externally to outside parties.
But is USPS still a government agency?  It says so [in some places](http://postalnews.com/blog/2015/05/09/postal-myths-2-the-usps-is-not-a-government-agency/)

1. Update on Chair of the Faculty.  My family read it in my notes
as "Chair of Poultry".  New benefits.  Identifying a missing person
(challenge to readers who are on the Grinnell faculty: What full
professor, other than Anne and Raynard, was not on the original list?).

1. Backups.  Drive died.  Got a new one.  How long does it take to
copy 1 terrabyte using rsync?  About a day.  Why so long?

1. GC in the news.  Used to be one of my favorite things.  But it seems
to have disappeared.

1. Taking up space.  I take up physical space. But I also take up
??? space.

1. One hundred words.  (Two musings: One just 100 words.  One the
longer description.)  See my ENG 207 directory.

1. Prereqs. We have them for a reason.  Talking to colleague about
them.

1. Surprising my young self.  A bit ago, a colleague posted a question
on Facebook, something like, "What about your current life would most
suprise your college-age self?"  So I've been thinking about it.
Weight.  Don't listen to most current music [I used to listen to a lot
of 'XRT].  Don't spend nearly as much time at the movies as I used to.

1. The passion of late converts.  Joyce and Laura's posts.  Supporting
staff.  More.

1. You're not bad with computers.  Computers are bad with you.

1. GC in the news.  Why did it go away?  One of my favorite things.
Recent ones: Kumail.  Kumail again.  Rachel Rose.  Albert Owusu
Asare.

1. Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.  (Maybe Wednesday this week.)

1. "The Champagne of Beers".  What does that mean?  It's not like
they've called it the "Lafite Rothchild of beers".  Do they mean
that it's carbonated?  Most beer is carbonated.  Do they mean that
it's made in the Champagne region of France?  (Yes, I realize that
Champagne is supposed to be fancy.  But it's an odd metaphor.)
At least in the US, Champagne didn't used to have protection; any
sparkling wine could be labeled that way.
Ah!  [Sold in
bottles](https://onmilwaukee.com/bars/articles/miller-high-life-champagne-sized-bottles.html).
Didn't they know that clear bottles are bad for beer?

1. Shiksas are for Practice. Michelle and I were watching _The Marvelous
Mrs. Maisel_.   Somewhere in one of the episodes, Joel's father says
"Shiksas are for practice". It even appears in [a list of ten of the
best Jewish jokes in that series](https://www.heyalma.com/the-10-best-jewish-jokes-in-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel/).  It's something I recall hearing
somewhere, but not something my family ever said.  In fact, I recall
my grandmother saying "It's hard enough to find love, you shouldn't
..."

1. Albums from my past: Ringo.  One of the wonders of the
Intereweb is that you discover new music and experience music from your
past in new contexts.  Recently, someone shared a playlist of twenty
versions of Randy Newman's "Have You Seen My Baby" [endnote list].  Even before
listening, I said to myself, "I think of that as a Ringo Starr song."
Now, Ringo was clearly the least good singer in the Beatles.  But
I still bought his _Ringo_ album whne it was released and I listened
to it a lot.  [...]

1. An experience with online copies.  In Vida's class.  G.H. Hardy article.
Looks like it's the original,
<http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/hardy.pdf>.  Student
says "That formula seems incorrect".  Bio students do hand-waving argument
to argue that it is correct.  At least they fixed it promptly.  How many
people read it .... My email is to rrobbins.

1. Restoring tenure for Library and PE faculty?

1. Should the Dean attend CSFS meetings?  The handbook says so.
Ther must be a reason.  My sense is that traditionally, CSFS reads
a lot of proposals pertaining to faculty scholarship, and the Dean
should know about that work.  CSFS also reads all of the sabbatical
proposals, and the Dean should read those.  On the other hand, CSFS
meetings are much less interesting than they used to be.  I suppose
this can be yet another handbook change.

1. Blurbs.  I write a short (typically one sentence or less) blurb
for every musing.  They appear in most of the indices and in the
RSS feed.  Does anyone read them?  Should I include them in the
musings themselves?

1. UofC reaches $100,000 in tuition + room and board.  <https://hechingerreport.org/university-of-chicago-projected-to-be-the-first-u-s-university-to-charge-100000-a-year/>.  "I don't mind subsidizing".  Sorry, but you're not subsidizing.

1. Sabbaticals for Staff.  The president took one. Maybe start small.

1. Interviewing at conferences.  For many years, many disciplines have
relied on their primary conferences as a venue for interviewing 
prospective faculty.  MLA.  CS has never relied on them (at least not
in my time as a professional).  When I asked an older economist whether
they had made changes, I was surprised at their reaction: "The cost
of attending a conference is small compared to the cost of graduate
education; it shouldn't be a problem."  I tried to convince them that
travel plus hotel (even a shared AirBNB) is a burden to many folks,
but they were insistent.  Then I talked to a younger economist.  It turns
out the econ is much like CS; the number of open positions outstrips
the number of candidates.  Hence, while it may cost a bit to attend
the conference, it has a clear payoff.  That's in stark contrast to the
MLA meeting, in which the odds of landing a job seem surprisingly slim.

1. Economies of scale.  One of the side effects of the growth of the
Interweb and e-commerce has been the appearance of high-volume used
book sellers [Not used booksellers], like Better World Books and 
Thrift Books.  These booksellers [correct this time] have a high enough
volume that they don't need to make much on each book.  BWB, in 
particular, has an interesting model: They get large numbers of discarded
books from libraries [including Drake library], promising some return
on the sales of those books.  [I'll admit that I'd prefer we sell books
in the store or at the sale, since we make much more that way.  But we
always have a ton [literally] left after thesale.]  BWB seems to have 
a continual sale of books they've had too long, with $1.50 off each if
you buy six or more.  Since they have a lot of cool books that are 2.99,
including free shipping, you can get six used books for $9.00.  [I'm pretty
sure that the libraries get nothing.]  Of course, this means that they
pay little attention to the details of any one book.  Shows up when I
try to order special editions.  Also Amazon pricing bots.

1. A tale of two unions.

1. Rebelsky Games.  See rebelsky-games-break-2020-01-xx.

1. The Fiboacci Spiral.  Damian Hirst, Intelletual Property, and
my Final Project for Sculpture.

1. Choosing a book for Rebelsky Reading Group, Revisited.  I spent
the remainder of Winter break reading books.  _The Starless Sea_.
Some Howard Frank Mosher.  What else?

1. Academia.edu.  I keep getting messages from Academia.edu.  "The
name Samuel Rebelsky was mentioned in an influential paper" and
things like that.  Unfortunately, it's one of those baiting things;
you have to pay to find out more.  But I've always been surprised
at how often I get those messages.  Today, I went to look for one
of the things I was mentioned in, since there seemed to be enough
detail.  It turns out that the citation that mentioned my name was
as follows. "C. Karagiannidis and D. Sampson. Accommodating learning
styles in adaptation logics for personalised learning systems. In
P. Barker and S. Rebelsky, editors, Proceedings of World Conference
on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications 2002,
pages 1715–1726, Denver, Colorado, USA, 2002. AACE."  So it turns
out that I'm not being cited; the proceedings I edited are being
cited.

1. Today's Grinnell photo.  Some time in the past semester, I started
a habit of taking a photo of something I noticed on campus and posting
it to Facebook with a caption, along with the phrase "Today's Grinnell
Photo".  I was a bit snarky at first, particularly given that they were
doing all sorts of strange construction across the street from my new
office.  But I think my photos have been generally positive.  A few get
staged, such as when I build an art project.  But most are just a reaction
to something I've seen.  Helps me look more closely.

Long

1. Child of faculty.  Last child graduating Grinnell.  Three more years
until Youngest graduates (but not from Grinnell).  Being the child of
a faculty member is weird, which is why I discouraged my children from
attending Grinnell.  My own experince was as the child of a faculty
member at a large research university, a faculty member in child psych.
Mom used me as an example.  A lot.  When I was young, she even brought
me in to show to her stuents.  I still recall that when I was five or
so, I was in class with three friends

1. Growth in the number of staff.  (staff-growth-...)

1. Departmental honors. (departmental-honors-...)

1. For Mike: Teaching CS.

1. How do I introduce the end-of-month musings?  Collect all of the introductions
and then reflect on them.  "At the end of each month, I write a musing that
reflects back on the past month of musing and ranting.  As I 
[noted recently](another-month-2020-01), I often feel challenged to write
the first paragraph, as I'm saying more-or-less the same thing I've said
every month.  Nonetheless, I do write each paragraph anew.  I wonder if I
can learn something about my writing from reading through them."

1. Caps on special topics courses.

1. Course caps.  I wonder how I should look at the data?  I wonder if
anyone else has looked at the data?  How do we classify courses?

1. GrinnellPlans: Early experiments in Social Media.

1. Transitioning Web sites.

1. Adventures in Racket Autograding.

1. I hate (some) parents.  I'm on both the Grinnell Parents Facebook
group and the Stanford Parents Facebook group.  In general, I find
them good groups to be a part of.  We share tips.  We commiserate
about being so far from our kids [1]. [1] I'm not so far from my
Grinnell kid.  But you know what I mean.  However, there are times
that these groups make me furious.  Recently, a [second-year student
at Stanford passed
away](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/01/20/update-campus-community-death-undergraduate-student/).  One of the parents wrote, "My understanding is this child died of an overdose. Why is it not mentioned in this letter?"  What in hell
was that parent thinking?  If you lost a child, even to drugs, would
you want that information sent out to the whole campus?  I know that I
wouldn't.

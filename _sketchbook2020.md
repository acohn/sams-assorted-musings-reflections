SamR's musing sketchbook for 2020
=================================

_This document serves as my "sketchbook" of potential musings and
rants for 2020.   It's where I put notes on those musings.  Since
it's an electronic document, it will change regularly.  For example,
when I finish a musing, it tends to disappear from the sketchbook;
sometimes some traces remain._

_The document also tends to contain other notes related to the musings
and rants, such as a potential schedule of musing (one I rarely hold
to) and a list of software that I want to write._

Tentative sequence of upcoming musings
--------------------------------------

* MLK Day
* Games at the Rebelskys'
* Adventures in Web server transitions
* Story/Evidence/Perspectives
* More Story/Evidence
* Donating in my name / Donation fantasies (?)

Software to write
-----------------

1. Add blurb to the head.  (Is this conceptual or actual?)

1. 'liquify' script to add the heading to prior musings.

1. Script to find unmentioned musings.

1. Move indices to separate directory. 

1. `survey` script to take a list of musings (a list of dates?) and
summarize the contents.

1. Move scripts to bin.

1. Generate the one-liner for the indices.

1. Share code between bin/make-item and bin/index

Written, need minor revisions
-----------------------------

1. The Pyramid.

1. The joy of code: Concise perl.

1. Donation fantasies.

1. My Apple Watch (my-apple-watch)

1. Depression (depression-2019-12-12)

Written, need major revisions
-----------------------------

1. Getting things right - Faculty handbook (faculty-handbook-2019-08-28).

1. Bookstore gift cards (bookstore-gift-cards-2019-11-xx)

1. Practica Policies (practica-policies-2019-10-xx.md).  This
will evolve into "Learning about Lessons", or something like that.

1. Lost to the kerf.  (lost-to-the-kerf.md)

Short

1. Homework for Ralph's class.

1. Ways to say no.  I'm on sabbatical.  But I keep getting requests
to do things.  Will you run a Faculty/Staff Friday?  Yes.  Will you
give a talk on the History of Tutorial?  Yes.  Will you be the
treasurer for my campaign?  Yes.  Do you want to be involved in
Tapia?  Yes.  I'm also tempted to volunteer to do things.  Hey, can
I be involved in the planning for the anniversary of Tutorial?  I'm
working on learning to say "No", or "No Thank You", or something
like that.  Will you meet with this student group?  Nope; ask another
faculty member.  Will you supervise a MAP or independent?  Nope.
Will you attend this meeting?  Probably not.  I still haven't managed
to separate myself from department, division, and faculty meetings.
But that's partially because I don't think I can complain about things
unless I've been part of the discussion.  For example, I missed the
discussion of end-of-course evaluations for First-Year Experience.
(Did I know it was going to happen?  I'm not sure.)

1. Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.  (Maybe Wednesday this week.)

1. "The Champagne of Beers".  What does that mean?  It's not like
they've called it the "Lafite Rothchild of beers".  Do they mean
that it's carbonated?  Most beer is carbonated.  Do they mean that
it's made in the Champagne region of France?  (Yes, I realize that
Champagne is supposed to be fancy.  But it's an odd metaphor.)

1. Albums from my past: Ringo.  One of the wonders of the
Intereweb is that you discover new music and experience music from your
past in new contexts.  Recently, someone shared a playlist of twenty
versions of Randy Newman's "Have You Seen My Baby" [endnote list].  Even before
listening, I said to myself, "I think of that as a Ringo Starr song."
Now, Ringo was clearly the least good singer in the Beatles.  But
I still bought his _Ringo_ album whne it was released and I listened
to it a lot.  [...]

1. An experience with online copies.  In Vida's class.  G.H. Hardy article.
Looks like it's the original,
<http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/hardy.pdf>.  Student
says "That formula seems incorrect".  Bio students do hand-waving argument
to argue that it is correct.  At least they fixed it promptly.  How many
people read it .... My email is to rrobbins.

1. Restoring tenure for Library and PE faculty?

1. Should the Dean attend CSFS meetings?  The handbook says so.
Ther must be a reason.  My sense is that traditionally, CSFS reads
a lot of proposals pertaining to faculty scholarship, and the Dean
should know about that work.  CSFS also reads all of the sabbatical
proposals, and the Dean should read those.  On the other hand, CSFS
meetings are much less interesting than they used to be.  I suppose
this can be yet another handbook change.

1. Blurbs.  I write a short (typically one sentence or less) blurb
for every musing.  They appear in most of the indices and in the
RSS feed.  Does anyone read them?  Should I include them in the
musings themselves?

1. UofC reaches $100,000 in tuition + room and board.  <https://hechingerreport.org/university-of-chicago-projected-to-be-the-first-u-s-university-to-charge-100000-a-year/>.  "I don't mind subsidizing".  Sorry, but you're not subsidizing.

1. Sabbaticals for Staff.

1. Interviewing at conferences.  For many years, many disciplines have
relied on their primary conferences as a venue for interviewing 
prospective faculty.  MLA.  CS has never relied on them (at least not
in my time as a professional).  When I asked an older economist whether
they had made changes, I was surprised at their reaction: "The cost
of attending a conference is small compared to the cost of graduate
education; it shouldn't be a problem."  I tried to convince them that
travel plus hotel (even a shared AirBNB) is a burden to many folks,
but they were insistent.  Then I talked to a younger economist.  It turns
out the econ is much like CS; the number of open positions outstrips
the number of candidates.  Hence, while it may cost a bit to attend
the conference, it has a clear payoff.  That's in stark contrast to the
MLA meeting, in which the odds of landing a job seem surprisingly slim.

1. The Fiboacci Spiral.  Damian Hirst, Intelletual Property, and
my Final Project for Sculpture.

1. Choosing a book for Rebelsky Reading Group, Revisited.  I spent
the remainder of Winter break reading books.  _The Starless Sea_.
Some Howard Frank Mosher.  What else?

1. Academia.edu.  I keep getting messages from Academia.edu.  "The
name Samuel Rebelsky was mentioned in an influential paper" and
things like that.  Unfortunately, it's one of those baiting things;
you have to pay to find out more.  But I've always been surprised
at how often I get those messages.  Today, I went to look for one
of the things I was mentioned in, since there seemed to be enough
detail.  It turns out that the citation that mentioned my name was
as follows. "C. Karagiannidis and D. Sampson. Accommodating learning
styles in adaptation logics for personalised learning systems. In
P. Barker and S. Rebelsky, editors, Proceedings of World Conference
on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications 2002,
pages 1715â€“1726, Denver, Colorado, USA, 2002. AACE."  So it turns
out that I'm not being cited; the proceedings I edited are being
cited.

1. Today's Grinnell photo.  Some time in the past semester, I started
a habit of taking a photo of something I noticed on campus and posting
it to Facebook with a caption, along with the phrase "Today's Grinnell
Photo".  I was a bit snarky at first, particularly given that they were
doing all sorts of strange construction across the street from my new
office.  But I think my photos have been generally positive.  A few get
staged, such as when I build an art project.  But most are just a reaction
to something I've seen.  Helps me look more closely.

1. Departmental honors. (departmental-honors-...)

1. For Mike: Teaching CS.

1. How do I introduce the end-of-month musings?  Collect all of the introductions
and then reflect on them.  "At the end of each month, I write a musing that
reflects back on the past month of musing and ranting.  As I 
[noted recently](another-month-2020-01), I often feel challenged to write
the first paragraph, as I'm saying more-or-less the same thing I've said
every month.  Nonetheless, I do write each paragraph anew.  I wonder if I
can learn something about my writing from reading through them."

1. Caps on special topics courses.

1. Course caps.  I wonder how I should look at the data?  I wonder if
anyone else has looked at the data?  How do we classify courses?

1. GrinnellPlans: Early experiments in Social Media.

1. Transitioning Web sites.

1. Adventures in Racket Autograding.

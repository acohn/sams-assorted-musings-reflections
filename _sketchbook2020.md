SamR's musing sketchbook for 2020
=================================

_This document serves as my "sketchbook" of potential musings and
rants for 2020.   It's where I put notes on those musings.  Since
it's an electronic document, it will change regularly.  For example,
when I finish a musing, it tends to disappear from the sketchbook;
sometimes some traces remain._

_The document also tends to contain other notes related to the musings
and rants, such as a potential schedule of musing (one I rarely hold
to) and a list of software that I want to write._

Tentative sequence of upcoming musings
--------------------------------------

* News from academia
* Levers
* Comfortable structures (comfortable-structures)

Software to write
-----------------

1. Add blurb to the head.  (Is this conceptual or actual?)

1. 'liquify' script to add the heading to prior musings.

1. Script to find unmentioned musings.

1. Move indices to separate directory. 

1. `survey` script to take a list of musings (a list of dates?) and
summarize the contents.

1. Move scripts to bin.

1. Generate the one-liner for the indices.

1. Share code between bin/make-item and bin/index

1. Bookstore gift cards (bookstore-gift-cards-2019-11-xx)

1. Practica Policies (practica-policies-2019-10-xx.md).  This
will evolve into "Learning about Lessons", or something like that.

1. Lost to the kerf.  (lost-to-the-kerf.md)

Excerpts from Staff Governance
------------------------------

1. Staff Tenure.  Chief Diversity Officer.  I had asked at a Faculty
meeting whether they would be hired with tenure, since I'm pretty sure
we did that with a prior CDO.  That's a position that needs soem p
protection so that they can "Speak Truth to Power".  I hear rumors that
Power is worried about adding another tenured position.  But we hire
the President with tenure and the Dean with tenure.  Why not the CDO?

Original was called "The Binary System: A pretty damn clear guide
to a quite confusing concept by Christine R. Wright with some help
from Samuel A. Rebelsky" and came from a WISP student at Grinnell.
At least I think it did.  Maybe a CS 4 student.  [Wait until I hear
back from my Dartmouth alum friend.

reading.

1. Number of majors (need to run this one by Todd).  Jim Swartz,
former Dean of the College and one of the faculty leads on the HSSC
says that one we'll know the HSSC is successful is that the
distribution of students will switch from the sciences back towards
the humanities and social studies.  Now, Jim doesn't think that the
HSSC will change national trends; it might not even convince folks
to migrate disciplines at Grinnell.  But it might convince students
already interested in those areas to come here.  [Maybe that should
go at the end.] The other day, I was chatting with another faculty
member about the distribution of majors at the College.  I'd really
like to see us return to a distribution of about 1/3 Science Majors,
1/3 Humanities majors, and 1/3 Social Studies Majors.  But when I
said that, they replied that some departments wouldn't want to lose
majors, and I think they were implying that my department would not
like to lose majors.  But I'd *love* to lose majors.  With, say,
twenty-five or thirty majors in each class year, rather than sixty,
it would be likely that I'd know all of the majors.  More people
showed up for things when we were smaller (or at least a greater
percentage).  More opportunities for service courses.  Would we be
over-staffed, given that we have eight FTEs?  Well, we certainly
wouldn't be teaching at capacity.  But that means we'd have more
opportunities for special topics classes, for classes for non-majors,
for service courses, and the like.  Right now, we average about 22
advisees per faculty member.  If we dropped to 30 majors per year
and continued to teach one 13-person Tutorial per year, we'd be
down to eleven major advisees per faculty member, which is pretty
close to the College average.  WIth two Tutorials per year, we'd
be at the College average.  So yes I'd like to be smaller.

1. Taking notes on paper vs. taking notes on the computer.  The
latter is much easier to search.  But I feel like I learn beter
from the former, and I think there is evidence of that.

1. Mixtapes/Songs I love and my kids will hate.  

1. Touching People.  <https://www.buzzfeed.com/shelbyheinrich/men-stop-touching-us>.  It's what I was taught to do, although at the shoulder, not the 
waist.  I hadn't realized that it felt so invasive.  I'd rather signal,
and shouting seems impolite.  So what does one do?

1. Experiencing the workload of a Grinnell student.  Taking two
classes.  Assignment (I took an hour; some of my classmates said
they were able to get it done in twenty), one-hour audio that I could
not figure out how to speed up (probably not appropriate to speed up).
Additional reading for another hour.  I probably get more email.  I
may have more 

1. "I can't come to class.  My rat died and my other rat is in
mourning."  Funny.  But such a great strategy.  You only have
four grandparents, but can have an arbitrary number of pets.  
[Disclaimer: I tend to hate the jokes of the effects of the
end-of-semester on the mortality of grandparents.  So why I am I
writing this?]  But Ralph said, "Don't tell me your rat died, that's
something I'll remember about you forever."  Of course, he also asked
in class about objects to which we have a special attachment.  Won't
he remember those forever, too?

1. Commas and conjunctions.  I want the comma with dependent clauses,
not with independent ones.  But it's the other way around.  Do I like
the comma with the dependent clause because it feels like an appositive
or an aside?  On hand, when they are independent, it feels like they 
are of equal value, and don't need the comma.  I wonder why the conventions
developed.

1. Online book shopping. (online-book-shopping)

1. Learning from my email.  The other day, USPS noted that they
would be happy to send me photos of some of my email before I
received (on the day I was to receive it), something they call
[informed delivery](https://informeddelivery.usps.com/box/pages/intro/start.action).  I thought I'd only get
photos of packages and registered mail and such.  But it appears
that I get photos of almost all of my mail.  I'm pretty sure that they're
not taking photos as an extra service; rather they are just forwarding
along the photos that they have already taken.  My quick search for
information on security issues revealed [some concerns about the ability
to sign up to get someone else's email](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/usps-informed-delivery-is-stalkers-dream/).  But my concern is more who has
access to the photos.  Can the police or FBI access them without a warrant?
[The USPS FAQ](https://faq.usps.com/s/article/Informed-Delivery-Privacy-Security-Concerns) says nothing about that.  [The Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_Delivery) says that "he Postal Service adheres to the privacy requirements of the Privacy Act established by the federal government which controls when and how the USPS shares personal information and limits the conditions in which that information can be disclosed externally to outside parties.
But is USPS still a government agency?  It says so [in some places](http://postalnews.com/blog/2015/05/09/postal-myths-2-the-usps-is-not-a-government-agency/)

1. Backups.  Drive died.  Got a new one.  How long does it take to
copy 1 terrabyte using rsync?  About a day.  Why so long?

1. GC in the news.  Used to be one of my favorite things.  But it seems
to have disappeared.

1. Taking up space.  I take up physical space. But I also take up
??? space.

1. Faculty house.

1. One hundred words.  (Two musings: One just 100 words.  One the
longer description.)  See my ENG 207 directory.

1. Prereqs. We have them for a reason.  Talking to colleague about
them.

1. Surprising my young self.  A bit ago, a colleague posted a question
on Facebook, something like, "What about your current life would most
suprise your college-age self?"  So I've been thinking about it.
Weight.  Don't listen to most current music [I used to listen to a lot
of 'XRT].  Don't spend nearly as much time at the movies as I used to.

1. The passion of late converts.  Joyce and Laura's posts.  Supporting
staff.  More.

1. You're not bad with computers.  Computers are bad with you.

1. GC in the news.  Why did it go away?  One of my favorite things.
Recent ones: Kumail.  Kumail again.  Rachel Rose.  Albert Owusu
Asare.

1. Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day.  (Maybe Wednesday this week.)

1. "The Champagne of Beers".  What does that mean?  It's not like
they've called it the "Lafite Rothchild of beers".  Do they mean
that it's carbonated?  Most beer is carbonated.  Do they mean that
it's made in the Champagne region of France?  (Yes, I realize that
Champagne is supposed to be fancy.  But it's an odd metaphor.)
At least in the US, Champagne didn't used to have protection; any
sparkling wine could be labeled that way.
Ah!  [Sold in
bottles](https://onmilwaukee.com/bars/articles/miller-high-life-champagne-sized-bottles.html).
Didn't they know that clear bottles are bad for beer?

1. Shiksas are for Practice. Michelle and I were watching _The Marvelous
Mrs. Maisel_.   Somewhere in one of the episodes, Joel's father says
"Shiksas are for practice". It even appears in [a list of ten of the
best Jewish jokes in that series](https://www.heyalma.com/the-10-best-jewish-jokes-in-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel/).  It's something I recall hearing
somewhere, but not something my family ever said.  In fact, I recall
my grandmother saying "It's hard enough to find love, you shouldn't
..."

1. Albums from my past: Ringo.  One of the wonders of the
Intereweb is that you discover new music and experience music from your
past in new contexts.  Recently, someone shared a playlist of twenty
versions of Randy Newman's "Have You Seen My Baby" [endnote list].  Even before
listening, I said to myself, "I think of that as a Ringo Starr song."
Now, Ringo was clearly the least good singer in the Beatles.  But
I still bought his _Ringo_ album whne it was released and I listened
to it a lot.  [...]

1. An experience with online copies.  In Vida's class.  G.H. Hardy article.
Looks like it's the original,
<http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/hardy.pdf>.  Student
says "That formula seems incorrect".  Bio students do hand-waving argument
to argue that it is correct.  At least they fixed it promptly.  How many
people read it .... My email is to rrobbins.

1. Restoring tenure for Library and PE faculty?

1. Should the Dean attend CSFS meetings?  The handbook says so.
Ther must be a reason.  My sense is that traditionally, CSFS reads
a lot of proposals pertaining to faculty scholarship, and the Dean
should know about that work.  CSFS also reads all of the sabbatical
proposals, and the Dean should read those.  On the other hand, CSFS
meetings are much less interesting than they used to be.  I suppose
this can be yet another handbook change.

1. Blurbs.  I write a short (typically one sentence or less) blurb
for every musing.  They appear in most of the indices and in the
RSS feed.  Does anyone read them?  Should I include them in the
musings themselves?

1. UofC reaches $100,000 in tuition + room and board.  <https://hechingerreport.org/university-of-chicago-projected-to-be-the-first-u-s-university-to-charge-100000-a-year/>.  "I don't mind subsidizing".  Sorry, but you're not subsidizing.

1. Sabbaticals for Staff.  The president took one. Maybe start small.

1. Interviewing at conferences.  For many years, many disciplines have
relied on their primary conferences as a venue for interviewing 
prospective faculty.  MLA.  CS has never relied on them (at least not
in my time as a professional).  When I asked an older economist whether
they had made changes, I was surprised at their reaction: "The cost
of attending a conference is small compared to the cost of graduate
education; it shouldn't be a problem."  I tried to convince them that
travel plus hotel (even a shared AirBNB) is a burden to many folks,
but they were insistent.  Then I talked to a younger economist.  It turns
out the econ is much like CS; the number of open positions outstrips
the number of candidates.  Hence, while it may cost a bit to attend
the conference, it has a clear payoff.  That's in stark contrast to the
MLA meeting, in which the odds of landing a job seem surprisingly slim.

1. Economies of scale.  One of the side effects of the growth of the
Interweb and e-commerce has been the appearance of high-volume used
book sellers [Not used booksellers], like Better World Books and 
Thrift Books.  These booksellers [correct this time] have a high enough
volume that they don't need to make much on each book.  BWB, in 
particular, has an interesting model: They get large numbers of discarded
books from libraries [including Drake library], promising some return
on the sales of those books.  [I'll admit that I'd prefer we sell books
in the store or at the sale, since we make much more that way.  But we
always have a ton [literally] left after thesale.]  BWB seems to have 
a continual sale of books they've had too long, with $1.50 off each if
you buy six or more.  Since they have a lot of cool books that are 2.99,
including free shipping, you can get six used books for $9.00.  [I'm pretty
sure that the libraries get nothing.]  Of course, this means that they
pay little attention to the details of any one book.  Shows up when I
try to order special editions.  Also Amazon pricing bots.

1. Choosing a book for Rebelsky Reading Group, Revisited.  I spent

Some Howard Frank Mosher.  What else?

1. Academia.edu.  I keep getting messages from Academia.edu.  "The
name Samuel Rebelsky was mentioned in an influential paper" and
things like that.  Unfortunately, it's one of those baiting things;
you have to pay to find out more.  But I've always been surprised
at how often I get those messages.  Today, I went to look for one
of the things I was mentioned in, since there seemed to be enough
detail.  It turns out that the citation that mentioned my name was
as follows. "C. Karagiannidis and D. Sampson. Accommodating learning
styles in adaptation logics for personalised learning systems. In
P. Barker and S. Rebelsky, editors, Proceedings of World Conference
on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications 2002,
pages 1715–1726, Denver, Colorado, USA, 2002. AACE."  So it turns
out that I'm not being cited; the proceedings I edited are being
cited.

1. Today's Grinnell photo.  Some time in the past semester, I started
a habit of taking a photo of something I noticed on campus and posting
it to Facebook with a caption, along with the phrase "Today's Grinnell
Photo".  I was a bit snarky at first, particularly given that they were
doing all sorts of strange construction across the street from my new
office.  But I think my photos have been generally positive.  A few get
staged, such as when I build an art project.  But most are just a reaction
to something I've seen.  Helps me look more closely.

1. Random art projects.  Stations of the cross.  Although I'm not Catholic
[I do have catholic tastes], I often go to Mass with my family.  As we visit
different churches, I appreciate seeing the different ways that artists,
individual and commercial, represent the stations of the cross.  At times,
I'd like to make it an art project.  Get a high end camera.  Travel the
country, from Church to Church, photographying the stations carefully. 
Posting and organizing.  Allowing others to submit.

1. Van Meter Monster.  Friends posts interesting fact each day.

1. Let me tell you a story.

1. Let me tell you another story.

1. Scaffolding and metacognition.  More is better, right?  Okay,
we know that's not always the case.  More food is not better.  More
consumption, in general, is not better.  More years with certain
politicians in office is definitely not better.  Still, those are
exceptions that prove the rule.  The other day, I was at a wonderful
Faculty (& Staff?) Friday on Metacognition, conducted by the
even-more-wonderful Belinda Backous [I'm serious; Belinda is one
of those folks who everyone feels fortunate to have as a colleague.
I should probably add her to my list of people to profile.]  What's
metacognition?  The term is self descriptive, kkkkkkit's thinking
about how you think.  [Or learning how to learn, in the parlance
of the academy.]  Somewhere in the middle of the presentation, she
put up a slide< one of whose points was something like "More explicit
instructions on assignments help develop metacognition."  That
seemed strange to me.  Isn't part of the point of metacognition the ability
to develop processes?  And don't you learn to develop process, at some
point, by develping them yourself?  Introduce scaffolding.  It's a
balance as an instructor, particularly since students are often at
very different places.  

1. Intent vs Impact.  You intend a gateway, an entrance that guides
people onto campus, with walls carefully designed to encourage
students to perch reading, photogenically.  I see a wall, designed
to separate.  Others do, too.  How could one not, in this political
climate?  Some see an attempt to mimic our more prestiguious
colleagues.  "I tried to jew him down, but he gyped me." Often think
about in the context of microaggressions.  But also what I'm told
upsets people about some of my rants.  "You don't know the whole
story."  Nope, I don't.  I'm reporting on the impact I see from
your action, or at least the impact I feel.  Of course, the same
holds for me; I don't intend to make you feel bad or undervalued.
Well, generally I don't.  I want you to know how you make me feel.
Certainly at the root of the huge difference over reactions to the
new stonework on campus.  To some, they are gateways to help direct
people and frame the campus.  And that's their intent.  But to
others they are walls, separating our enclave from the surrounding
community.

1. Child of faculty.  Last child graduating Grinnell.  Three more years
until Youngest graduates (but not from Grinnell).  Being the child of
a faculty member is weird, which is why I discouraged my children from
attending Grinnell.  My own experince was as the child of a faculty
member at a large research university, a faculty member in child psych.
Mom used me as an example.  A lot.  When I was young, she even brought
me in to show to her stuents.  I still recall that when I was five or
so, I was in class with three friends

1. How do I introduce the end-of-month musings?  Collect all of the introductions
and then reflect on them.  "At the end of each month, I write a musing that
reflects back on the past month of musing and ranting.  As I 
[noted recently](another-month-2020-01), I often feel challenged to write
the first paragraph, as I'm saying more-or-less the same thing I've said
every month.  Nonetheless, I do write each paragraph anew.  I wonder if I
can learn something about my writing from reading through them."

anyone else has looked at the data?  How do we classify courses?

1. On being Jewish at Grinnell.  I've always thought of myself as
"culturally Jewish", rather than religious.  But my Judaism clearly
shapes my world view.  Increasingly, I'm finding that identity
challenged.  In America as a whole, anti-semitism is on the rise.
Why can't we hire a Rabbi?  Why can't we *keep* a Rabbi once we
hire them?  Why did we eliminate the position in Jewish studies?
Broader world.  I understand people are frustrated at Israel's
treatment of Palastine.  But the extermination and exhile of Jews
from the neighboring countries or from Europe does not seem to be
mentioned.    How many Jewish faculty remain?  Don't want to play
"my suffering is worse than yours".

1. I hate (some) parents.  I'm on both the Grinnell Parents Facebook
group and the Stanford Parents Facebook group.  In general, I find
them good groups to be a part of.  We share tips.  We commiserate
about being so far from our kids [1]. [1] I'm not so far from my
Grinnell kid.  But you know what I mean.  However, there are times
that these groups make me furious.  Recently, a [second-year student
at Stanford passed
away](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/01/20/update-campus-community-death-undergraduate-student/).  One of the parents wrote, "My understanding is this child died of an overdose. Why is it not mentioned in this letter?"  What in hell
was that parent thinking?  If you lost a child, even to drugs, would
you want that information sent out to the whole campus?  I know that I
wouldn't.

1. Carnegie library.  Who is there right now?  According to [the Grinnell Magazine](http://magazine.grinnell.edu/about/visit/spaces/carnegie-hall), Shakespeare, Dante, Homer, Plato, Michelangelo, Darwin, Goethe, Galileo, Emerson, and Caesar.    Who would you add?  Who are we adding?  Morrison.  Who decided?  I have no idea.  Is Toni Morrison a great writer?  Without doubt.  Are there others who belong as much?  Possibly.

SamR's musing sketchbook for 2020
=================================

_This document serves as my "sketchbook" of potential musings and
rants for 2020.   It's where I put notes on those musings.  Since
it's an electronic document, it will change regularly.  When I
finish a musing, it tends to disappear from the sketchbook._

1. If I had six months to live.  I'm not sure why, but I was feeling
maudlin the other day, and asked myself what I'd do if I had six
months to live.  My first reaction was "I'd get rid of all the crap
I've accumulated so that my kids wouldn't have to."  But I realized
that I should probably check with them first in case they had some
strange reason to want to keep things.  And I also began to wonder
whether that's something I should do now, rather than later.  But
I find it hard to get rid of things.  (See, for example, my regret
at getting rid of my old NESFA newsletters.)  Of course, I would
also set aside and document things that I thought the kids might
want to keep because they have particular meaning to me or the
family, such as the shark's tooth that my father used to wear (Did
he wear it, or did he just have it set up so that he could wear
it?) or the autographed Phil Ochs albums.  I also have some things
that likely have value to others.  It would make sense to set those
aside for the kids to sell.  Maybe the first set of things could serve
as the topics of musings.

1. For Mike: Teaching CS.

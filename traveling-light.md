Traveling light
===============

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

When I travel, I tend to over-pack.  I bring an extra set of shoes,
an extra sportcoat, a bunch of ties, at least one extra day's worth of
clothes, and so on and so forth.  I also like big suitcases so that I
have room to pick up something new and bring it back home [1].  Back
when airlines allowed it, I'd have three carry-ons: a laptop bag for
my laptop, a separate bag for my CPAP [2], and a small suitcase with
one day's worth of clothes on the off chance that the airline lost
my luggage.

Recently, I chose to go in the opposite direction.  For a three-day
college exploration trip with youngest, I inadvertently booked "Basic
Economy" fares on American and United.  For those of you who don't know,
"Basic Economy" means "let's see how few amenities we can give you".
Can you choose your seat?  Nope.  Can you know what seat you're getting
before you get to the airport?  Maybe, but they can change their mind.
Can you use the overhead bin?  Nope.  When do you board?  Last.  Can you
check in in advance?  It depends on the airline.  American says "Yes".
United says "Only if you're planning to check a bag".

As you might guess, the expectation with basic economy is that you will
check a bag.  But I hate waiting for luggage if I don't have to.  And I'm
a cheapskate.  So I tried to see if I could fit everything in one backpack.
What is "everything" for a three-day trip (plus one night of travel)?

* One pair of pants.
* Three shirts.
* Four undershirts, underwear, and socks.  (I like a spare.)
* Four pairs of socks.
* Toiletries [3].
* Medicine [4].
* My CPAP.
* My computer.
* Charging supplies.
* A book to read [6].
* A Kindle.
* A few protein bars.

Amazingly, I could fit all of that into one backpack.  It was a little
tight and a little bigger than the desired size, but it fit.  I also wore
my [sportcoat](coat-and-tie) because it provides extra pockets and because
I wasn't sure about the weather on the other end.

Did the backpack fit?  On American (my flight out), I needed to remove
the Kindle and the book in order to cram it under the seat.  My flight
back on United was a worse experience; they seem to have less space and
they don't have separators between under-seat storage, so my slightly
overpacked bag ended up competing with Youngest's slightly overpacked bag.
I had to remove the book, the Kindle, and the laptop to make it fit on
my first United flight.  On my second, much smaller, United flight, I
needed to turn it into two personal items to fit into the designated
space.  They didn't seem to mind.

One great thing about having such a tightly packed bag was that I was
not tempted to buy anything, even when I visited the Computer Museum
Gift Shop.  I knew there wouldn't be room.  And, well, I don't really
need anything else.

I don't think I'll try that again.  I'd rather have access to the
overhead bins.  I'd rather know that I'll be seated near my family [8].
I'd rather not stress.

But it was nice to know that, if necessary, I can travel lighter than
I normally do.

Postscript: It looks like I could arrange my
stuff better for basic economy.  United says
that [I can also bring "assistive devices and medical
devices"](https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/travel/inflight/basic-economy.aspx).
Does a CPAP count as an assistive device?  It appears [that they
are](https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/special-needs/disabilities/customer-ventilators.html),
although that may only be ones that people need regularly.
What about American?  They say that ["Mobility
and medical devices donâ€™t count toward carry-on
limits.  These include ... continuous positive airway pressure machines (CPAP)"](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/special-assistance/mobility-and-medical-devices.jsp).

[1] I particularly like accumulating conference swag when I attend
conferences.

[2] I never send my CPAP through checked luggage if I can avoid it.

[3] I always bring a full-size hairbrush, which is the only one that
seems to work with [my hair](my-hair).  Also toothbrush, toothpaste,
and antiperspirant.

[4] I may overpack on medicine.  I bring ibuprofen, naproxen sodium,
Benadryl [5], an "allergy emergency" kit with a variety of medicines, an
inhaler, some band-aids, and a few more bottles whose purpose I
currently forget.

[5] More likely a generic.

[6] I could have done without the book.  But plane trips are one of my best
opportunities to read and I wanted to read Grinnell's new "Common Read",
_Homegoing_ [7].

[7] I plan to muse about _Homegoing_ at some point.  But I'd like to reread
it first and, because many of my summer students want to read it, it's out
on a sequence of loans

[8] I was generally seated next to Daniel or within a row or so.
But they don't guarantee it.

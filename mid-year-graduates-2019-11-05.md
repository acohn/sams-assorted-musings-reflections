Mid-year graduates
==================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short, endnote-laden [1,2,3], rambly*

At yesterday's faculty meeting, the faculty approved the mid-year
graduates.  More precisely, we approved a motion that we recommend
that a set of students, upon meeting the requirements of the College,
receive the Bachelor of Arts degree [4].  If I recall correctly,
at graduation [7], a representative of the Trustees of the College
says something like, "The Trustees of Grinnell College, upon the
recommendation of the faculty, award the degree of Bachelors of
Arts to all students who have met the requirements for that degree"
[8].

There were twenty-six candidates for mid-year graduation.  I
immediately recognized four of them as CS majors.  That large number
surprised me at first.  Then I remembered that about one-seventh of
Grinnell seniors are CS majors [9].  Hence, it should not be surprising
that four of the twenty-six are people I can immediately identify
as CS majors.  However, as I went through the list a second time,
I realized that six of the twenty-six are CS majors.  Does that
signal anything?  I don't think so; I expect that we're just seeing
some natural variation.

Of course, it may also be that some kind of chain reaction was
involved.  That is, Parent 1 may have said to Student 1, "You have
a lot of credits.  We'd save a lot of money if you graduated early."
Student 2, upon hearing that Student 1 was graduating early, may
have looked to see if they could also graduate early.  Student 3,
upon hearing that Students 1 and 2 were planning to graduate early,
may have looked to see if they could graduate early.  Or something
like that.  But what do I know?

I'll certainly miss many of our mid-year graduates.  They are students
I've come to know and appreciate over the years.  It will be strange
not to have them around anymore [10], particularly since at least one of
them would regularly nest in my lab.  More generally, I'll miss
their leadership, their enthusiasm, and, in most cases, their
sarcasm.

Postscript: The Trustees approved the candidates during their meeting
of October 2-5, 2019.  Since it's "on the recommendation of the
faculty", aren't they supposed to approve candidates *after* we do,
rather than before?  Let's hope the timing gets resolved this spring.

Postscript: I decided to go beyond estimates.  From what I can tell from
Grinnell DB, there are 60 CS majors in the class of 2020 and 374 students
in the class of 2020.  That means that nearly one in six seniors are CS
majors.  After mid-year graduation, it looks like 54 of 348 seniors will
be CS majors, which is much closer to one in seven.  There are currently
404 students in the class of 2021, 59 of whom are CS majors.  That's much
closer to one in seven.  Since most second-year students have not 
declared a major [11], I cannot compute that ratio.  The numbers for the 
class of 2021 are also likely to change a bit over the next year as
students add second majors or drop majors [12].

Postscript: For those who care, here's the query I used to estimate the
number of CS majors in the class of 2020.  You can figure out the
appropriate variants to search for other groups [15].  You can probably
also find ways to make it shorter.

[1] Since I've been using "end note", I suppose that tag should be "laden with
end notes".  However, I prefer the more concise tag.

[2] More precisely, "laden with end notes and postscripts, at least compared
to the length of the main body of the musing".

[3] I recall that Middle Son objected to my including references to end notes
in the titles of musings.  I wonder how he feels about them in the topics/tags
section.

[4] I don't have the exact language.  I hope that someone does.  At worst,
we can find it in an earlier set of faculty meeting minutes [5].

[5] The May 6, 2019 minutes have the following motion.

> Dean Michael Latham moved to approve the list of candidates for commencement provided in the advance meeting materials pending the successful completion of all requirements for the degree. The motion was seconded and approved by voice vote. 

The October 1, 2019 minutes have the following motion.

> Dean Michael Latham moved to approve the list of candidates for commencement provided in the advance meeting materials pending the successful completion of all requirements for the degree. The motion was seconded and approved by voice vote. 

I tried looking back a few years before then, so that I could see what we
did before Mike was here.  I was surprised to discover that I could not find
any approval of candidates in 2012-2013 [6].

The September 16, 2013 minutes have the following.

> With an addition of [Name Elided], [Interim Dean David] Lopatto moved to approve a list of students seeking the Bachelor of Arts degree at mid-year contingent upon the successful completion of all degree requirements. The motion carried. 

[6] That doesn't mean we didn't do it.  It just means that I couldn't find it
in the faculty meeting agendas or minutes.  I'll also admit that I didn't spend
too much time on the task.  Ah!  Here's the issue ... I didn't look early
enough in the year.  The minutes of the meeting of September 17, 2012 
include the following.

> Smith moved to approve a list of students seeking the Bachelor of Arts degree at mid-year contingent upon the successful completion of all degree requirements. The motion carried. 

I'm still having trouble finding when we approved the spring candidates.

[7] At least at spring graduation.

[8] Once again, the language is approximate.  I know I have a graduation
script somewhere in my files, but my files are boxed up right now.

[9] We now graduate about sixty CS majors per year and about four hundred
students per year.  If I do my math right, that means that one in seven
graduates is a CS major.

[10] It will likely help that I'm on sabbatical, and so wouldn't see all
that much of them this spring.

[11] While many majors allow students to declare before spring of their
second year, CS tries to restrict earlier declarations so that all students
have an equal opportunity to get their choice of advisor.

[12] How much of a difference do declared majors make?  If my counts are
correct, Grinnell has 374 students in the class of 2020, but 486 declared
majors.  In contrast, Grinnell has 404 [14] students in the class of 2021,
but only 472 declared majors.  If the 2020 ratios hold, 53 students in the
class of 2021 will declare another major.  I don't expect that that will
mean that another seven or eight students in that class will add a CS
major, but you never know.

[14] No, that's not an HTTP error.

[15] The URL should only work on campus.

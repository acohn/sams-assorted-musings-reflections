A fun conversation
==================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

The other day, I was talking to my research students and one of my
students mentioned [If you ask a prof a question](if-you-ask-a-prof).
None of the other research students had seen it, so we did a live
reading of the first 42 pages [1].  Some were clearly horrified.
Others were amused.  None agreed with my suggestion that it should be
required reading for Tutorial.

As we discussed that primer, I discovered that half of them did not know
that I mused daily.  So we talked a little bit about that.  One of those
who did know about the daily musings made the off-handed comment that
"If you Google 'is [anal retentive](anal-retentive) hyphenated?', Sam's
page is the first one that comes up. [2]"  Then another started to read
the disclaimer at the end of the page.  "Does Grinnell make you write
that?", they asked.  While Grinnell does not "make" me write that, it
is responsible of me to include such a disclaimer [3,6].

And then they asked about my middle initial.  So I gave the latest version
of my traditional story.

> My parents didn't consider it appropriate to constrain my name.  So 
they named me "S. A. Rebelsky".  They decided that once I was old enough,
I could choose what the "S" and the "A" stood for.  And they figured that,
at worst, "S. A." was a good name for a writer.  

Some looked confused [8].

All in all, it was a fun conversation.  It certainly involved a lot of
laughter.

[1] I'm told that it falls apart after those first 42 pages.  But I 
introduce the writing lab after that, so I do think it's reading further.

[2] I've always suggested that we get that result because Google does
geo-located searches.  However, that student convinced friends elsewhere
to do the same search.  It appears that if you want to know about
anal-retentive hyphenation, my musings are the reference to check.

[3] The _Faculty Handbook_ indicates that
> D. "College or university teachers are citizens, members of a learned profession, and officers of an educational institution. When they speak or write as citizens, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline, but their special position in the community imposes special obligations. As scholars and educational officers, they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances. Hence they should at all times be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for the opinion of others, and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the institution." [4,5]

p. 69.

[5] Note that the quotation marks appear in the original because the language 
comes from the American Association of University Professors.  

[6] The same page includes a note that reads as follows.

> E. Provisions A, B, C, and D of this section are, and are hereby made,
part of the contract, written or implied, of every faculty member.

So maybe Grinnell *does* require me to write the disclaimer [7].

[7] Hmmm ... Part B also includes a note that "The College thinks
that it is clearly unethical to use the classroom to discuss specific
personnel matters."  I wonder when that got added to the handbook.
Let's see ... It was there in the 2010 edition.  I'll need to find
hardcopies to go back further.

[8] "S. A." can be pronounced "essay".

Dilly Dilly?
============

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

The other day, I was driving along I-80 and looked up at one of the
LED billboards that the state puts up.  Here's what it said,

> 235 Traffic Deaths This Year

> Impaired Driving-

> Nip It In The Bud

> Dilly Dilly

You can see a picture in
[a DOT Web page](http://www.transportationmatters.iowadot.gov/2018/10/nip-impaired-driving-in-the-bud-dilly-dilly.html).  I'm not sure if it's real or simulated.  I've also linked to it below.

Underneath the billboard is the tagline "ZERO Fatalities A Goal We Can All Live With"'/>

I understand the desire to encourage people to encourage people to drive
safely, but "dilly, dilly"?  What were they thinking?  And what does it
mean?

I could not remember where I'd heard the phrase.  It appears
that it's just that I don't watch enough sporting events.
With not much effort, I found that it's from [a Bud Light
commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Cb5Wk2t-8) that implies
that spiced mead wine is less welcome than the comparatively tasteless
swill [1] that is Bud Light.  And yes, I'd seen the commercial; it's
almost certainly where I'd heard the phrase before.

Now I'm left to wonder, *Did Budweiser sponsor this message?*

Postscript: I'm also left to ask myself whether it would be a bad
idea to comment about the Budweiser affiliation on [the DOT Web
site](http://www.transportationmatters.iowadot.gov/2018/10/nip-impaired-driving-in-the-bud-dilly-dilly.html).  Probably.  It's not a good idea to make the
State mad.

Postscript: For a short musing, this one took way too long to write.

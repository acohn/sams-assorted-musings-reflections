New computing policies
======================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), long, rambly, footnote-laden*

This summer, ITS [1] released two new policies, one entitled
"ITS-US-800-P Provision Reuse and Lifecycle Replacement of Endpoint
Computing Devices" and one entitled "ITS-BF-800-P Software budgeting
and purchasing policy" [2].  Both are available on [the ITS policies
page](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/its/SitePages/Policies.aspx)
[5], along with a variety of appendices [6].  

Many aspects of these policies bother me.  What aspects?  Let's see.

1\. I am bothered by *a failure to appropriately include faculty
governance* in the creation of these policies.  What kind of
governance would I like to see?  For one thing, the Instructional
Support Committee is supposed to provide not only guidance, but
also leadership, on academic computing [7].  However, ISC was only
consulted on a few aspects of the policies and did not sign off on
the broader policies.  These are also policies that have broad
impact; in cases like that, Executive Council should be consulted
[8].  In fact, Council had already asked about rumors that they had
heard about shifts in computer purchasing policies and, *in spite
of their request for more information*, this policy was not shared
with Council before it was enacted.  **That represents a significant
failure of shared governance.**

2\. I am also bothered by *the failure to appropriately include staff
governance*.  These policies also affect staff, and the designated staff
representatives (Staff Council) should have a chance to comment on them.
I would also suggest that broader input should be included, but I am not
aware of an equivalent to faculty meetings for staff.  In the end, many
eyes help catch issues.  (Conversely, too few eyes leave open issues.)

3\. I am particularly bothered by the new "endpoint computing device"
policy's *poor treatment of term faculty*.  In particular, the
policy indicates that

> New Endpoint Computing Devices are not purchased for Non-Regular Employees or Non-Regular positions. If requested, ITS will allocate a desktop Endpoint Computing Device from the Reserve Pool. Please note that there may not be a choice of operating system. 

Because term faculty are not regular faculty.  this policy suggests
that someone the College hires for a one-year, or two-year, or
three-year position gets whatever computer ITS feels like giving
that person.  But here's the things, we should treat our term faculty
well [9]. Telling someone that they can't have the operating system
they want for their research and teaching is highly inappropriate.
In addition, at least in my experience, using the wrong OS also
makes one much less efficient.  I am probably at least 20% more
efficient on my Mac than I am when someone forces me onto a PC.  I
hear that PC users feel lost on Macs.  Term faculty are expensive
[11].  Shouldn't we make them feel valued?  And shouldn't we get
the best possible work out of them?  Is saving $1000 or $2000 really
worth what we lose?  I think not.

I hear that some staff members also do not get to choose their
operating system.  That also strikes me as troublesome.  There may
be cases in which it is necessary that staff members use a particular
operating system, such as when software relevant to their position
runs only on one OS.  But other than that, they should also have
freedom.

_**Detour**_

I raised these concerns as soon as I saw the new policy [12].  I
believe I first raised them with my Council rep, but I can no longer
recall.  At some point, the Dean's office got involved.  I thought
I'd made my point, and changes would be made.  But I was wrong.

During the first week or so of classes, I learned indirectly that
a new colleague asked for a Mac and received a PC.  Because term
faculty do not know what social capital they have, they are unlikely
to complain [14].  From my perspective, that makes it particularly
important that our default is "you get what you ask for" not "you
get what ITS feels like giving you".  Fortunately, I have some
social capital [15].  I raised the issue and it looks like my
colleague will get the appropriate computer in a few weeks.

Does that settle the matter?  No.  Here's the wonderful note I received
from my Associate Dean.

> On a related point [...] the Dean considers this an exception made due to a special request, while following the policy and procedures of ITS. That is, in supporting [Faculty Member's] request, we are not weighing in one way or another about the policy itself. If you remain interested in seeing changes to the policy, you should pursue that through other channels (which may nonetheless involve the Deanâ€™s Office).

Here's how I responded.

> Thanks [Associate Dean]!

> And yes, I am interested in seeing changes to the policy.  I've already written to you about these concerns.  What other avenues should I follow?  Do you need a more detailed description of my objections?

> Thanks again,

> -- SamR

I have not yet heard back.

I worry that this note suggests that our primary goal is to support the
desires of ITS, rather than the needs of faculty and staff.  I know that
ITS has many challenges.  But, in the end, the goal of technology policies 
should be making sure that people are appropriately supported (albeit
at reasonable cost).

_**Returning from the detour**_

_In case you have forgotten, I was enumerating some aspects of the
new computing policies that bother me.  Here are a few more_

4\. I am bothered about *the timing of the announcement*, particularly
with regard to the budget cycle.  The policies, which take effect
for the 2019--20 budget year, were announced at the end of June
2019.  On the other hand, department budgets were due in late 2018.
Since the new policies suggest that departments may now be responsible
for some software and equipment purchases, the announcement should
have been made in time for changes to be incorporated into budgets.
In fact, departmental budgeting is one of the reasons that Council
asked about these issues [16].

5\. *The new software policy makes no explicit mention of software
for scholarship* [17].  Not so surprisingly, many faculty use
software in their scholarship.  Hence, one would expect that the
policy would explicitly discuss such funding.  As far as I can
tell, scholarship falls under "other academic use", but that is not
made explicit.

The process diagram doesn't help, since it has a decision point
that reads "Academic (Teaching) Use?"  Is the parenthetical remark
intended to be an explanation of what we mean by academic, or is
it supposed to represent a subset of academic use?  If the latter,
why not just use the term "Teaching" directly?    If you choose the
path labeled "No" from "Academic (Teaching) Use", the next decision
point is "Other academic or administrative use?", with choices of
"Other academic" and "Administrative", suggesting that there are
no other options.  If your use is "Other academic", you should
Consult Office of the Dean".  If your use is "Administrative", you
should use "Individual Administrative Department Operating Budget"
[18].

6\. *I don't see evidence of people considering implications and
connections.*  If ITS is no longer covering software for scholarship,
and the Dean's office may not be, shouldn't we be able to use our
Committee for the Support of Faculty Scholarship funds to pay for
software related to our scholarship [19]?  I also find it odd that we
don't seem to have released policies that apply to other aspects
of computing, such as tablets or hard drives.  Perhaps those are
coming in the near future.

As I suggested above, we miss implications and connections when we do
not involve governance structures.  Having more eyes consider these
policies *before* they were implemented would help catch unintended
consequences.  Let's hope for better governance in the future.

---

Postscript: Just to make myself clear: I don't object to the creation
of policies about selection and purchase of computing hardware and
software.  Clear policies help eliminate bias and can safe the
College some funds.  What I object to is the process for creating
processes, which has left out important faculty voices, and the
limited view revealed by the policies, which is likely affected by
the lack of shared governance.

---

Postscript: It strikes me that I should turn this rant into a letter
to appropriate folks.  But I think that task is going to wait for
another week.  For now, it has let me get my frustrations into order.
I expect that the letter will focus on governance (faculty and staff)
and on the treatment of term faculty.

[1] Grinnell's Information Technology Services department.

[2] I don't know why they chose different capitalization policies for
the two documents.  However, as too many people remind me, foolish
consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds [3].

[3] Am I required to cite that aphorism [4]?  Should I put it in
quotation marks?  And does it matter that I seem to have changed
"little" to "small"?

[4] It's from Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Self Reliance".  I'm not sure why 
I have difficulty recalling that, particularly given how often I use
or mangle that statement.

[5] Why can't we put our policies on a public Web site?  Are we embarrassed
about them?

[6] The _Software budgeting and purchasing policy_ has a _Software
funding budgets process diagram_ and an _Additional funding sources_
list.
The _Provision, Reuse, and Lifecycle Replacement of Endpoint Computing
Devices_ has a _Lifecycle replacement process diagram_.

[7] For those who have been here less time than I have: During an attempt
to cut the number of faculty committees, the responsibilities of the
Academic Computing Committee were (ACC) folded into the Instructional
Support Committee (ISC).  I can't recall exactly when that happened,
but I think it was around 1999/2000.

[8] The full faculty should be consulted; however, I realize that
not everyone feels that way.

[9] I like to think we *do* generally treat our Term faculty well.  They
have full voting rights at faculty meetings, they receive some funding
for research and conference travel [9], they are eligible to supervise
MAPs and to be compensated for that supervision, and they are eligible,
but not required, to advise students.  They are also included in the
Early Career Faculty and Staff group, which also plans some events for
term faculty.

[10] I wish they received more.

[11] Not as expensive as tenure-track faculty, but still expensive.

[12] Admittedly, I only raised the first two.  I still need to work on
my own failure to uniformly acknowledge the appropriate roles of Staff
Council.

[14] Some may also not have a personality that permits them to make waves.

[15] Or at least tenure.

[16] This may be one of those instances in which "department" is
supposed to mean "administrative department" rather than "academic
department".  If that is the case, I hope the administrative
departments were notified of the shift in policy at the appropriate
stage in their budgeting cycles.

[17] Grinnell has traditionally used the term "scholarship" rather than
"research".  Scholarship seems to be more inclusive, particularly if one
pays attention to sources like Boyer's _Scholarship Reconsidered_.

[18] Strangely enough, those two options are the only ones that have a
successor.  What is that successor?  STOP.

[19] The CSFS policies specifically forbid using your scholarship funds
for computing equipment and software [20].  

[20] I've been told that some exceptions have been made, but that seems
to be somewhat ad hoc; the policies do not seem to be applied uniformly.

[21] My mind seems to keep getting smaller.

[22] Bold in the original.

[23] DLAC is the [Grinnell Digital Liberal Arts Collaborative](https://dlac.grinnell.edu/) [24].

[24] While I think of collaborative as an adjective, it is also used
as a noun.  However, [some people dislike that
practice](https://www.comnetwork.org/insights/collaborative-n/).
Unfortunately, Garner seems to provide no commentary on this issue.

[25] I thought this would be the last question, and so I wrote "Just looking at the form to figure out what questions I need to prepare to answer."

[26] Ah!  I hadn't read the prior "additional information" question
properly.  I think this is the last one [27].

[27] Why doesn't Qualtrics let you know when you're answering the last
question on a multi-page survey? [28]

[28] That seems like a good topic to muse about.  I'll add it to the list.

Expanding the faculty
=====================

Theme/tags: Grinnell, the faculty, rants [1]

The other day, I was talking with a colleague about the husk [2].  The
College is spending something like $140 million on the husk.  In
comparison, a new chaired position at the College costs $5 million.
I believe that the interest on that $5 million pays the costs of a faculty
line _ad infinitum_.  So it seems that we could add 28 new faculty
lines instead of building the husk [3].  That many new lines could have
a variety of positive effects on the College, not least of which is
decreasing our student to faculty ratio to something like seven to one.
I wonder what the impact of that low a ratio would be on admissions [4].
My colleague said something like "I'd teach in a garage if it allowed us
to have enough faculty lines."  I'm not sure that I'd go that far, but
I really do wish that our President and Trustees thought more carefully
about the benefits of expanding the faculty.

In any case, once I started thinking about expanding the faculty, I started
thinking about where I'd allocate new faculty lines if I had that power.  If
I really had that power, I'd start by talking to colleagues to think
broadly about what would help the institution.  We could do a lot of
creative things with new faculty lines.  And I certainly don't know all
of the needs on campus.

But you have to start somewhere.  So I'll make my own list.  In making the
list, I must admit that I am thinking inside a box of my own, represented
by the current teaching and departmental models at Grinnell.  I had thought
of grouping the new positions into categories (e.g., "to meet student demand",
"supporting core liberal arts", "new areas of study"), but decided that I
would prefer to just list positions as they came to mind.

Without further delay, here are some positions I think Grinnell should
consider adding.

* _Computer science_.  I'll start closest to home.  If we wanted to do all 
  the things we feel we should do for our majors, and we continued to
  need to support between fifty and sixty majors in each class year,
  we need two more tenure-line positions [6].  But that turns out to
  be relatively tight, so I'd give CS three positions to include a
  little slack.  That slack would accommodate unexpected leaves, a few
  more regular Tutorials [7,8], and the ability to participate in the
  various initiatives on campus, such as bridging courses.
* _Architecture_.  Okay, Grinnell does not have an architecture program,
  so this line would probably go into Art History.  This case is not
  so much a line as a person.  We have an amazing visitor teaching our
  architecture courses.  They are an alum of the College.  They do really
  creative things in their courses, taking students to museums around
  the country and places around the world.  Students love them and their
  classes are popular.  They are valued enough that they appeared on the
  latest issue of the _Grinnell Magazine_.  We should avail ourselves
  of the opportunity to keep them here.
* _Classics_.  Two years ago, Classics "temporarily" lost a tenure-line
  position to either CS or Biology [9].  That position needs to be
  restored.  Classics is a key aspect of a liberal arts education and
  we need to have a fully staffed Classics department.
* _Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies_.  GWSS is in a strange
  situation.  I believe they have two tenure-line positions.  But one
  of the faculty who occupies those positions is serving a long-term
  stint as an administrator.  GWSS is a popular major and many courses
  are also popular for non-majors.  It would be good to see one more
  tenure-line position in the department.
* _Mathematics and Statistics_.  As far as I can tell, all of the 100-
  and 200-level courses in Mathematics and Statistics fill.  I know that
  Statistics 209 regularly has a waiting list of about one or two classes
  full of people.  I know that they have to close students out of Linear
  Algebra and the bridging courses.  The new Statistics concentration and
  the push toward more opportunities in Data Science will just increase
  that demand.  The growth of the other sciences also adds to the demand
  on this department.  So I'd add a position in each of Mathematics
  and Statistics [10].   At that point, we'd have four Statisticians,
  and I'd consider splitting the department [11].
* _Studio Art_.  Studio art courses regularly over-enroll.  I think we had
  to add three or four sections of the intro course this semester
  and probably could have added a section of Drawing, too.  Many of the
  200-level courses have large waiting lists, particularly Digital
  Media or one of its variants.  So one new position in Studio Art
  is an easy choice.  But I also worry about the teaching load for my
  colleagues in Studio.  Many of their courses meet six hours per week.
  That means that they are in class eighteen hours per week in their
  three-course semester.  That's too much.  Most science faculty who teach
  six-hour-per-week courses earn 1.5 teaching credits for those courses.
  We should consider doing the same for Studio Art, at least at the 100
  level.  Covering that change probably requires another position [12].
* _Economics_.  Economics is usually the second-most popular major
  at the College.  They are stretched thin.  They need at least one
  other position, plus the restoration of the Sidney Meyer Chair.
* _Political Science_.  One of the most popular majors at the College [14]
  and one of the highest student to faculty ratios in the College, at least
  the last time I checked.
* _Religious Studies_.  Last year, Religious Studies lost a position
  [16]; I think it was the Asian Religious position.  That position should
  be restored.  Religious Studies also converted the Judaism position
  to another area about two decades ago.  Some part of me would like to 
  see a position in Judaism restored to the department, even though that
  represents an expansion.
* _Biology_ or _Biological Chemistry_.  Two very popular majors.  I know
  that the 300-level Bio classes regularly over-enroll.  We could
  probably use yet another faculty member to support those majors.
  I'd prioritize this one less than most of the others I listed, but
  it's still important.
* _Film and Media Studies_.  Grinnell lacks a program in Film and Media
  Studies.  I know that there's a strong push from a variety of faculty
  to add such a program, one focused more on the studio side of things.
  As much as I love film studies [17], I'm not sure that I'd pick that
  as the most central new area for the College.  But I did start by
  saying that I'd consult with colleagues, and this is one area that
  seems to have a lot of support.  Therefore, if we're adding positions,
  we should add two in Film and Media.

There are clearly a variety of other positions that are needed or that
would improve the College.  And these are just the first ones that
come to mind.  I know that there are others [18].  Here's the bigger
issue ...  I've just identified seventeen or so additional faculty lines
that would benefit the College.  With a zero-sum tenure-line system,
all of these positions are in conflict with each other [19] as well as
with the preservation of existing lines in other departments.

I do not envy Council.  They have an incredibly hard job in dealing with
all of this.  How do you balance supporting increased enrollments in 
departments, ensuring the continuation of core disciplines, and growing
the curricular breadth?  I'm not sure.

Are there departments that could get along with fewer faculty in this
situation, even though it would be less than ideal?  Almost certainly
[20].  Does the structure of the academy provide an easy way to shift
those lines?  Nope.  Nonetheless, tenure is essential.  What should we
do about it?  I think you know my answer; grow the faculty, even if it's
only temporary [21].

[1] My goal in this musing is not to rant.  It's to consider what we might
do if we excessive resources.  Nonetheless, because it's about resources
at Grinnell, parts of it clearly devolve into rant mode.

[2] "The husk" is the name some folks use for the Humanities and Social
Studies Complex, or HSSC.  I think it started as a way to pronounce "HSSC".
However, since it wraps around ARH and Carnegie, "husk" seems like a
good name.

[3] That's not quite accurate, as new faculty lines members also require
offices, ancillary support, and other resources.  On the other hand, new
faculty members earn much less than named chairs, so it may all balance
out in the end.

[4] I would hope that our supposedly data-driven administration would
have done a study about the effects of different ways of spending that
much money, including not just the ideas of "build a giant husk" and
"expand the faculty an insanely large amount", but also other things.
Of course, that would require a bit of "outside the box" thinking, and,
well, you know the rest [5].

[5] I still recall the response to my question of "You just designed
a new $100-plus-million-dollar building that assumes that we have
1650 students.  Now you're thinking about changing the size of the
student body.  Don't you think we should wait to break ground until after
we decide to change the number of students on campus?"

[6] Plus the eventual conversion of our Senior Lecturer position into a
tenure-line position.

[7] I really do want to teach Tutorial again.  I believe most of my
colleagues do, too.

[8] The last time I checked, even if we expand by two tenure-line positions,
we won't be able to increase the number of sections of Tutorial we teach.

[9] I have colleagues at other institutions that also have a "zero-sum
game" policy for faculty.  I'm always surprised that they don't know
what positions were lost when they gain a new position.  I feel the
pain of my colleagues who lost a position so that we could gain one.
It's one of the reasons I continue to advocate to the President and
with Trustees that we expand the size of the faculty.

[10] Given demand, it may be that we need two new positions in Mathematics
along with the one in Statistics.  For now, let's just say one and one.

[11] Hmmm .... Adding a position in Architecture would also put Art History
at four faculty members.  I might support splitting that department, too.

[12] No, I don't know where we'd put the studio space for two new studio
faculty.  I also don't know where we'd put lots of these other positions.
That's a separate issue.

[14] Political Science usually vies with Biology, Biological Chemistry,
and Mathematics for the third most popular major [15].

[15] Here are the statistics as of the afternoon of 15 April 2018.

* Class of 2020, majors with at least 20 majors
    1. Computer Science (44)
    2. Biology (43)
    3. Political Science (42)
    4. Biological Chemistry (41)
    5. Mathematics (32)
    6. Economics (31)
    7. Undeclared (25)
    8. English (22)
    9. Sociology (20)
* All declared majors, majors with at least 75 majors
    1. Computer Science (143)
    2. Biology (126)
    3. Political Science (122)
    4. Economics (120)
    5. Biological Chemistry (103)
    6. Mathematics (92)
    7. Psychology (87)
    8. English (75)

It looks like Econ has dropped from its traditional high because of
a particularly low showing in the class of 2020.  It also looks like
Biology and Biological Chemistry have been continuing to grow.  I'd
guess we'll see a bunch of changes in the next year.  I know that from my
experience, we'll see a lot of changes in CS as people start to add CS as
a second major; I assume other departments also have similar experiences.

If you want comparatively easy access to these data and
are on campus (or have a VPN connection to campus), I have
quick links to the directory pages that give you the data at
<http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/all-majors.html>.

[16] The calculus of this loss is a bit more complicated; Physics gained
a position last year, but had lost one the previous year.  So it may
be that the net effect is that the Religious Studies position went to
Computer Science or Biology.

[17] I took something like six different film studies classes as an
undergraduate and graduate student; I also worked for the student
film society, DOC Films, for most of my undergraduate career.

[18] I know that I'll soon find myself feeling guilty that I forgot
about a department or discipline that I really respect and that needs
more support.  I accept that my musings represent my thoughts on
a particular day and time.  I hope others accept that, too.

[19] Not quite.  For example, the three positions in CS are not really
in conflict with each other, nor are the two positions in Film and
Media Studies.

[20] No, I will not tell you which ones I would identify.  I will note,
however, that I would not cut from our smaller departments.

[21] That may mean Council would have to put together a list of departments
that might lose a position when it next comes up unless their enrollments
change.  That's not a great thing to have to do, but it may be necessary.

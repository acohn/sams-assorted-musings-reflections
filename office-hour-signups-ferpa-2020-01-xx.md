Office hour sign-up sheets and other FERPA issues
=================================================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia), short*

Some time this past semester, as I was reading excerpts from the
minutes of Grinnell's Executive Council [1], I learned that some folks
consider it a FERPA violation to post sign-up sheets for office
hours outside of our offices.  If I recall correctly, the question 
raised was why it is not permissibile to have sign-up sheets for 
office hours, but it is permissible to have people visit classes [2].

For those who don't know, FERPA is the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act, which specifies that institutions should limit how
they release students' educational records.  IANAL/IANAFO [2] so
you should take everything I say [3] about FERPA with a grain [4]
of salt.  As I understand it, there are three related issues at play 
in many of the situations we consider under FERPA.  First, there
are the FERPA policies themselves.  But there are also more general
questions about student privacy as well as questions about student
safety.

Here's what I understand about office-hour sign-up sheets: The
general sheets don't violate FERPA, since students could be signing
up to meet with you for a variety of reasons.  However, they do
potentially put students at risk, because they permit someone to
know where a student will be at a certain time.  The second issue
suggests that while general office-hour sign-ups are not illegal,
they may not be a good practice [6].  In contrast, sign-ups that
are tied to specific classes or to advising may violate FERPA because
they reveal that a student is in a particular class or has a
particular person as their academic advisor, both of which are often
considered part of students' academic records.

I will admit that I have not worried about these issues because I
primarily use electronic signups [7].  I didn't choose them for
FERPA or safety reasons; rather, I find that they make it easier
for me to tell what slots are available when a student writes to
say "Can I meet with you at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow?" or something
similar.

The ways in which we approach FERPA don't always make a lot of
sense to me.  I recall being told for many years that I should not
list the names of my research students in my CV or on the Web,
except in publications or when students choose to list themselves.
Why?  Because doing so reveals that they did research with me.  But
then the Dean's Office started publishing a public list of all the
MAP students and, after some conversations with other FERPA officers,
our FERPA officer determined that the Dean's Office's practice was
acceptable, which suggests that listing on CVs is also acceptable.
I forget the reasons why.

Of course, there are many ways in which general FERPA policy also
doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  For example, we have a number
of contractors who can access FERPA-protected data, including
convicted felons [8].  To deal with those issues, we typically
designate those contractors Officers of the College with a legitimate
educational interest in accessing the data, or something like that
[9].  You'd think that we would therefore have a legal responsibility
to inform students which contractors have access to data.  However,
my conversations with our FERPA officer suggest that we do not, and
I cannot find anything in the FERPA guidelines or FAQs that contradict
that claim.  I'd still prefer that students know the dozen or more
outside contractors that regularly have access to their data, but
that's not my decision.  And I'd really prefer that it be part of
the law.  But what do I know?

These issues also remind me about [the new and somewhat scary
practice of recording student attendance through phone
tracking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/24/colleges-are-turning-students-phones-into-surveillance-machines-tracking-locations-hundreds-thousands/).
I wonder how schools are dealing with the issue that these apps
(and, more importantly, the owners of those apps) have access to
FERPA-protected information.  While Degree Analytics does mention
FERPA on their [privacy page](https://degreeanalytics.com/privacy/),
I couldn't find anything on the SpotterEDU site.

In spite of these concerns, I consider FERPA a reasonable law.
Students are adults, and adults deserve some privacy.  While many
have good relationships with their families, not all do.  I realize
that FERPA frustrates many parents, I'd rather have policies in
place that protect students who want to keep some aspects of their
lives private from their parents or others.

Plus, FERPA makes my job easier: "Can I talk to you about my child's
work in your class?"  "You can certainly talk to me, but FERPA suggests 
that I can't say anything in response."

[1] The excerpts are generally available as part of the agenda for
faculty meetings.

[2] The relationship between the two is that both can reveal that
students are in a particular class, which is FERPA-protected
information.

[5] Why is it "granary" not "grainary"?

[6] Isn't it sad that we have to worry about such things?

[8] At least that's how one of my colleagues likes to refer to
Microsoft.

[9] It's a common hack to deal with the issue what Cloud Services
have access to FERPA-protected data, such as email or student
records.  By making them Officers of the College, we can legally
store our information on their servers.  And, if they breach FERPA,
they now bear the responsibility.  It also means that we don't have
to record the sharing of the data with them.  Or something like
that.  As I said, IANAL/IANAFO.  [One of the FERPA FAQs](https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/SRO_FAQs_2-5-19_0.pdf) says

> Contractors, consultants, volunteers, or other third parties to whom a school or district has outsourced certain functions may be also be considered "school officials." Schools and districts may disclose education records (and the PII contained in those records), without appropriate consent to such school officials provided that they (1) perform an institutional service or function for which the school or district would otherwise use employees; (2) are under the "direct control" of the school or district with respect to the use and maintenance of the education records; (3) are subject to FERPA’s use and re-disclosure requirements set forth in 34 CFR § 99.33(a); and (4) satisfy the criteria specified in the school or district’s annual notification of FERPA rights for being "school officials" with "legitimate educational interests" in the education records

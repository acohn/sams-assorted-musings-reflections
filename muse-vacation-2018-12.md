My muse takes a vacation
========================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta), short*

Starting about a week ago, I found that I was struggling to finish
my musings.  I was not inclined to complete any of the "sketches" that
are in progress, and most of the new musings I tried to write would taper
off before I could complete them [1].

When I sat down to muse a week ago, I found that I did not have the
mental energy to make forward progress on any sketches, even some of
the short ones.  So I decided to write something new.  I reflected upon a
variety of topics.  I considered ranting about parts of the College's
statements about the union.  But that was the evening of the College
holiday party; I didn't deem it appropriate to rant that night,
or perhaps any night during the holiday season.  I pondered writing
about the joy of seeing people at the annual holiday party.  But I
felt like I've written that before.  And, I must admit, I didn't know
what I'd say other than "I enjoyed the party and the pre-party [2]".
And nothing in my list of prospective musings caught my eye.

So I started to write this musing.  But I also ran out of energy [3]
before I finished.  At some point [4], I came to the conclusion that
my muse had decided to take a much-needed vacation.  So, rather than
push forward on musings that I would find unsatisfying and, rather than
making her [5] worry about the time away, I decided that I, too, could
take a break.  I even went so far as to spend four days AFK [6].

I'm back now.  I think my muse is, too.  At least I've been inspired
to start a few new musings.  But it's clear neither of us has completely
recovered from our respective vacations as I'm still having a bit of
8rouble completing each musing I start.

At least I finished this one!

[1] While that builds up my collection of "sketches", I'm not sure
that more sketches are a good thing.

[2] Yes, dear students, faculty members also sometimes have pre-parties.

[3] Or at least a sequence of ideas.

[4] I'm fairly certain it was before I even started this musing.

[5] In keeping with tradition, I gender my muse as female.

[6] Away from keyboard.

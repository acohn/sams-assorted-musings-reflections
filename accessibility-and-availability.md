Availability is not accessibility
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), [language](index-language), short*

Recently, I was musing about [the accessibility of
certain Web sites](pioneers-dot-grinnell-dot-ads) [1].
[Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) suggested that I use "availability"
rather than "accessibility".  *They're not the same thing!*  When applied
to "Web site" [2], "accessible" is often intended to mean "can be accessed
by people with different sets of abilities, including those with limited
sight, hearing, or mobility".  At least that's how I use it.

Grammarly is not alone in considering the terms equivalent.  I recall
asking some technology consultant about accessibility at their institution
and they replied with a comment on the order of "Our labs are very
accessible; they're upon twenty-four hours a day."  I'm glad that they're
open.  Will someone have to walk up stairs?

Postscript: There's a longer musing in me about the value

[1] Not only is it an ethical concern, it's also a legal concern.  And
it's a legal concern even if the Department of Justice or the Department
of Education fail to pursue accessibility issues under the ADA.  I see,
for example, that [someone recently sued fifty colleges and universities
because their Web sites are inaccessible](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/12/10/fifty-colleges-sued-barrage-ada-lawsuits-over-web-accessibility).

[2] And to many other things.

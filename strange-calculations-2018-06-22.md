Strange calculations
====================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

Tonight I took the counselors from the Craft of Code camp out to dinner
[1].  They deserved a nice dinner.  It's been a long week.  Every day
started before 8 am, ended after 6 pm [2], and was filled with nine- and 
ten-year-old children [3].  Many of the counselors also did additional work
in the evening to prepare the next day's curriculum or materials.

But my awesome counselors are not the subject of this musing.  Rather,
I'm musing about the bill from dinner.

The first bill I received from dinner had a subtotal of some number of
dollars and 22 cents.  It also had an automatic gratuity of 20% [4],
which was some number of dollars and 84 cents.  The total?  Some larger
number of dollars and 7 cents.  

Hmmm.

If you add two even numbers, you should get an even number.  If you add
4 cents and 2 cents, you should get six cents.  So I started to look more
closely at the bill, which, while expensive, seemed comparatively cheap.
I counted the number of entr√©es.  There were eight.  But I was pretty sure
that we had fourteen people.  So I recounted.  It seemed that six meals
were missing.

As you might expect, I talked to the wait staff [5].  They said that
it had printed two sheets of receipts but they only brought me one.
They went back to get the other.  I never got the other half.  However,
I did eventually receive a new bill.  This one added correctly and
included all of the meals.

But I'm a pain, so I asked them about the addition of four cents and two
cents on the original bill.  Their response? "Yeah, the iPad software
we're using doesn't always work so well.  It also doesn't work well with
parties of more than eight people."

I'm not sure how to react to those statements.  I will check my bills
carefully whenever I visit that restaurant, though.

Postscript: I also purchased a "to go" meal for a family member.  I forgot to
check over that bill.  I should have.  The subtotal was $13.99.  The gratuity
was $2.80.  The sales tax was $0.98.  And the total?

The total was $17.76.

While I'm happy to celebrate the birth of the US [6], I'm pretty sure that
the total should have been $17.77.

I really do want to understand how those kinds of addition errors happen
in the software.  How are they representing numbers?  And why do these
programmers still have a job?

[1] Since "team bonding dinner" is part of our budget, arguably the College
took the counselors from the Craft of Code camp out to dinner.

[2] Ah, the joy of non-hourly student workers.

[3] I'm pretty sure that every one of the counselors said something like
"I now have much more respect for elementary school teachers" at some
point during the week.

[4] I've heard rumors that accounting changes tips to 18%.  I wonder if that
really happens.  It certainly hasn't seemed to happen, but I haven't been
paying enough attention.

[5] It's tempting to take these kinds of "accidental discounts", but it's
wrong.

[6] Or whatever we associate with 1776.

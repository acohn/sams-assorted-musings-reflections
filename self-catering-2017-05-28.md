Self-catering, revisited
========================

In [a recent musing](delegate-2017-05-27), I discussed my difficulty in
delegating self-catering responsibilities for the CS Extras series.  One
of my readers provided an interesting comment.

> I'm sure there's more to it than this simple issue, but I find it kind
of sad that budgets won't support the use of the colleges own dining
services for catering their own events.

I would say that although it may not be all that complicated, there
are a number of issues that come into play.  In part, it's that the
College's budget process is not particularly agile.  In part, it's that
the department does not always consider other options.  In part, it's that
I'm stubborn.  In part, it's that processes are not always transparent.
In part, it's a question of what people value (or value enough to spend
money on.)

Of those, the budget process is perhaps the most complex, so I'll give an
overview.  We propose our budgets for a fiscal year (July through June)
in November.  At that point, we don't necessarily have a good picture
of what is happening in the current year, let alone what might happen
in the following year.  In addition, the College generally expects that
academic departments will have flat budgets.  We are allowed to shift
money within our budget, but our budgets generally don't grow much.

Let's consider the events we self-cater.

_The senior breakfast_.  Last year, we were hit by two issues: We tripled
the number of majors and catering raised the price of catered continental
breakfast (one starch, fruit, drink) from $6.40 per person to $8.40 per
person.  So, our costs when from about $320 (50 people at $6.40 each)
to $1260 (150 people at $8.40 each).  The budgeting process did not
allow us to have another $900 this year, so the Dean and I agreed that
we'd go a bit over on budget, but not that far over.  Last year, when we
used College Catering (I did not know they had raised the price), I was
surprised at how little food they provided.  One bagel or sweet roll, a
bit of fruit, and a drink does not always go that far.  We were further
affected because they gave us too little fruit and they would not bring
us more [1].  The stubborn part of me said "I can get much more food for
much less money."  I was right.  If the Dean was willing to come up with
the extra $800 or so to allow us to use College Catering for the 170 or
so I predict for spring 2018 [2], I will admit that I can see better uses
for those funds within the department, such as another peer educator.

_The Stats/Math/CS picnic_.  Until spring 2016, Dining Services allowed
departments to turn in student meal card numbers in exchange for food
for a department picnic.  We'd give them a list of numbers, they'd give
us a bunch of food which we would then cook.  So, in that sense, we
partially self catered.  Dining Services changed that policy last spring
(although they did not notify departments [3]).  We can use student meal
card numbers for $2.50 credit toward the $11.95 or so for a catered picnic [4]
or we can encourage students to use take-out containers for the picnic [5].
Similar issues come into play here: The College does not want to increase
our budget by the $2,000 or so that it would take to cater picnics
under the new policy and we don't really think it's worth that much.
Picking up at McNally's is not much different than picking up from
College Catering.  The bigger issue we face right now is that students
are bad at responding, so we had many more people at the picnic than we
expected and someone had to run off to get more food.

_CS extras_.  We've always self-catered the CS extras.  I don't think
we even knew we could use College Catering when we started CS extras,
and catering for talks was not part of the department's initial budget.
John Stone has seemed happy to pick up the food for CS Extras [6] and I
think we get a wider variety of options for significantly less expense
[8].

_Division meetings_.  I don't know the reasons that the Dean's office
decided to stop paying for College Catering at Division meetings.
I think there was a sense that it was not worth the cost.  I have
heard that we are again allowed to use College Catering.  However, at
this point, it feels like self-catering provides us with a wider variety
of options.  In addition, my students really do enjoy the leftovers.
We'll see what happens when I go on leave.

_Candidate lunches_.  If I'm not mistaken, these usually cannot be 
catered.  So the options are using the dining hall or self-catering.
Candidates have a better experience if we self-cater, and I'd like
candidates to have the best possible experience.

_Candidate talks_.  This is mostly a situation in which I'm being
stubborn.  The Dean's office will pay for College Catering for candidate
talks.  But I had awful experiences with College Catering - because
candidates are often scheduled with only a few days notice, Catering
is often unable to add talks to their schedule.  And, as I noted in the
previous musing, they cancelled on the same day as a talk.  I'd rather
prepare in advance for four talks than cater three and panic and rush 
at the last minute for one talk.

That's about it.  In some cases (Candidate talks, Division meetings), the
College would probably pay the cost of College Catering.  In others
(CS extras, the picnic, the Senior breakfast), it's not clear that
Catering is worth the cost.  

But don't even get me started about what the College is and is not
willing to pay for [9].

---

[1] I understand that Catering is overwhelmed on graduation day, so it is
understandable that they could not bring more.  But, as the person serving,
it was frustrating.

[2] That's $800 beyond the $600 or so we will use to self-cater.

[3] Or, as I review my notes, their own staff.  After we placed our
order last spring, we got a message from one of our ASA's that "So I
just received a phone call from [person] in catering.  It appears that
[they] just found out yesterday that they were no longer going to be
doing picnics."

[4] As a parent of College students, I also find it frustrating
that a meal I pay $14 for ends up giving only $2.50 of credit.
I somewhat understand the issues involved (Dining services has overhead,
even if students don't eat in the dining hall), but it's frustrating.

[5] Doesn't that sound great?  "Come to the Stats/Math/CS Picnic!  Bring
your own food from the dining hall."  [Followup rant elided.]

[6] Hmmm ... I could have a student assistant walk to McNally's [7].  I wonder
whether that's acceptable to the powers that be?  It's probably not the best
idea in Winter, but perhaps for the rest of the year.

[7] Having the student assistant walk is Michelle's idea.

[8] I think a typical talk costs about $200 to cater with a cheese tray,
a cookie tray, and drinks.  Catering prices do not seem to be available
online, so I can't be sure.  We spend under $50.

[9] No, that will not be another rant, at least not right now.

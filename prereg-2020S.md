Preregistration for Spring 2020
===============================

_Topics/tags: [Registration](index-registration), [Grinnell](index-grinnell)_

Almost every semester, as preregistration [1] period wraps up, I
like to sit down and reflect on what [the
data](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/) say
about popular courses and what likely stress points are.  Since
I've started musing, I've also tried to record some of the reflections
in a musing.  We've just about finished with the preregistration
period for Spring 2020 [2], so it seems like a good time to look
at the data.

For those who don't know, Grinnell handles course registration [3] in
a somewhat nontraditional way.  Rather than the "first come, first served"
model that many institutions use, we allow students to "pre-register"
for the courses they would prefer to take, even if that means that more
people end up enrolled in a course than the stated course capacity.  At
that point, we start to drop students from the course.  If we were sensible,
we'd keep the prereg data from semester to semester to better understand
patterns in student demand.

I tend to look at the data for three reasons: To figure out what stressors
the CS department will have, to find out what courses my students might
have to replace, and, well, I'm a bit of a data junkie.  I also try to
reflect on historical trends, at least as I recall them.

So, let's go.

First, let's see what courses are over-enrolled.  It's easiest to look
at the courses in alphabetical order by department [4].  AMS/ANT/BIO-220,
Racing Through Genetics, has 24 students in a course with a cap of
20.  That's not surprising; it's a cool topics and it usually has
two wonderful faculty teaching it.  I assume that Biology needed
Leslie for other courses.  But even without Leslie, Katya will be
awesome and generally over-fills her classes.  Given that, I'm
surprised that there are still some spaces in AMS-235.  Maybe some
students will choose to take that instead.

Three of the four sections of ANT-104, Anthropological Inquiries, are
over-full.  Section 2 has 27 with a cap of 25, section 3 has 29 with
a cap of 25, and section 4 has 52 with a cap of 25.  Yes, that's correct,
there are 27 *extra* students enrolled in that section who have to be
cut.  While there are nine slots open in section 1, that's not enough to
deal with the demand.  Will Anthro expand capacity, find a way to add
another section, or cut some students?

ANT/HUM-295, Designing Museum Displays, has 28 students enrolled in a
course with a capacity of 24.  I had expected that to be a Leslie Wright
course, but it looks like Kathy Kamp will be teaching it with Leslie.
Since folks are helping build displays for the HSSC, it should be an 
exciting course.  I'm not surprised that so many students have
registered.  I wonder who they will keep and who they will cut.  I
should suggest to my advisee who registered that they drop a note
to Kathy and Leslie.

ANT-395, Language and Humor, has 18 students enrolled and a cap of 15.
Seminars with 18 are hard, but it may be that they'll be generous in
this case.

Next up is Studio Art.  Anyone who regularly reads the registration
data knows that demand far outstrips supply in introductory art.
I still don't understand why Grinnell doesn't find a way to add
another tenure-line position in Studio [5].  How bad are things
this semester?  Section 1 of ART-111, Introduction to the Studio,
has 52 students enrolled with a cap of 15.  Section 2 has 52 students
enrolled.  So the course is over-enrolled by 64 students, enough
for *four* additional sections.  ART-134, Drawing, isn't quite as bad.  
It's only eover-enrolled by 31 students between the two sections.
So they'd only need two more sections to meet this semester's demand [6].
Other over-enrolled courses in art include ART-195, Intro to the Moving
Image (17 students for fifteen slots) and ART-295 (27 stuents for
fifteen slots).

Switching to the sciences, I see that section 1 of BCM-262 is
over-enrolled by 11 and section 2 has 4 open slots.  Biological
Chemistry [7] usually keeps students.  However, it looks like they'll
need to shift a bit, particularly in lab.  They may also need to add
another lab, if they can find the time.  One section of
BIO-150, Introduction to Biological Inquiry, is over-enrolled by 12.
However, there's room in the other courses.  Some students will get 
shifted around.  One section of BIO-252, Organisms, Evolution, Ecology,
is over-enrolled by eight students.  However, there are two other
sections, one with eight slots and one with seven slots.  Those should
balance out.

BIO-363, Neurobiology, has thirteen more students than the course can
hold.  I'm pretty sure that Clark was supposed to be on leave this year,
so

[1] I believe we've officially changed 

[2] I've forgotten whether prereg ends at 5pm or midnight on Thursday.  
It used to end at 5pm, but I seem to recall that we made changes in recent
years.  Ah!  The email message I have from the Registrar's office says
that it ends at midnight.  So I guess things can change a bit.  *C'est
la vie*.

[3] More accurately, registration for everything other than a student's
first semester, or when they're returning from leave.

[4] Or, more precisely, department abbreviation.

[5] Yes, I realize that we can find talented MFA students from UIowa
at relatively affordable prices.  But that's not particularly ethical.

[6] I realize that the demand would not be as high if they came closer
to meeting demand each semester.  But I'm pretty sure that the demand
would still be enough to warrant another faculty member.

[7] That's right, you should refer to it as "Biological Chemistry",
not "BioChem".

Preregistration for Spring 2020
===============================

_Topics/tags: [Registration](index-registration), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), assorted data, rambly, long_

Almost every semester, as preregistration [1] period wraps up, I
like to sit down and reflect on what [the
data](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/) say
about popular courses and what likely stress points are.  Since
I've started musing, I've also tried to record some of the reflections
in a musing.  We've just about finished with the preregistration
period for Spring 2020 [2], so it seems like a good time to look
at the data.

For those who don't know, Grinnell handles course registration [3] in
a somewhat nontraditional way.  Rather than the "first come, first served"
model that many institutions use, we allow students to "pre-register"
for the courses they would prefer to take, even if that means that more
people end up enrolled in a course than the stated course capacity.  At
that point, we start to drop students from the course.  If we were sensible,
we'd keep the prereg data from semester to semester to better understand
patterns in student demand.

I tend to look at the data for three reasons: To figure out what stressors
the CS department will have, to find out what courses my students might
have to replace, and, well, I'm a bit of a data junkie.  I also try to
reflect on historical trends, at least as I recall them.

So, let's go.

First, let's see what courses are over-enrolled.  It's easiest to look
at the courses in alphabetical order by department [4].  AMS/ANT/BIO-220,
Racing Through Genetics, has 24 students in a course with a cap of
20.  That's not surprising; it's a cool topic and it usually has
two wonderful faculty teaching it.  I assume that Biology needed
Leslie for other courses.  But even without Leslie, Katya will be
awesome and generally over-fills her classes.  Given that, I'm
surprised that there are still some spaces in AMS-235.  Maybe some
students will choose to take that instead.

Three of the four sections of ANT-104, Anthropological Inquiries, are
over-full.  Section 2 has 27 with a cap of 25, section 3 has 29 with
a cap of 25, and section 4 has 52 with a cap of 25.  Yes, that's correct,
there are 27 *extra* students enrolled in that section who have to be
cut.  While there are nine slots open in section 1, that's not enough to
deal with the demand.  Will Anthro expand capacity, find a way to add
another section, or cut some students?

ANT/HUM-295, Designing Museum Displays, has 28 students enrolled in a
course with a capacity of 24.  I had expected that to be a Leslie Wright
course, but it looks like Kathy Kamp will be teaching it with Leslie.
Since folks are helping build displays for the HSSC, it should be an 
exciting course.  I'm not surprised that so many students have
registered.  I wonder who they will keep and who they will cut.  I
should suggest to my advisee who registered that they drop a note
to Kathy and Leslie.

ANT-395, Language and Humor, has 18 students enrolled and a cap of 15.
Seminars with 18 are hard, but it may be that they'll be generous in
this case.

Next up is Studio Art.  Anyone who regularly reads the registration
data knows that demand far outstrips supply in introductory art.
I still don't understand why Grinnell doesn't find a way to add
another tenure-line position in Studio [5].  How bad are things
this semester?  Section 1 of ART-111, Introduction to the Studio,
has 52 students enrolled with a cap of 15.  Section 2 has 52 students
enrolled.  So the course is over-enrolled by 64 students, enough
for *four* additional sections.  ART-134, Drawing, isn't quite as bad.  
It's only over-enrolled by 31 students between the two sections.
So they'd only need two more sections to meet this semester's demand [6].
Other over-enrolled courses in Studio Art include ART-195, Intro
to the Moving Image (17 students for fifteen slots) and ART-295 (27
students for fifteen slots).

Switching to the sciences, I see that section 1 of BCM-262 is
over-enrolled by eleven students and section 2 has four open slots.
Biological Chemistry [7] usually keeps students.  However, it looks
like they'll need to shift a bit, particularly in lab.  They may
also need to add another lab section if they can find a time to
offer it and someone to staff it.  One section of BIO-150, Introduction
to Biological Inquiry, is over-enrolled by 12.  However, there's
room in the other courses.  Some students will get shifted around.
One section of BIO-252, Organisms, Evolution, Ecology, is over-enrolled
by eight students.  However, there are two other sections, one with
eight slots and one with seven slots.  Those should balance out.

---

You know what?  I'm bored with the over-enrollment data.  I assume
you are, too.  So let's just look at a few highlights [8].  Two of
the most over-enrolled courses are SST-195-01, the Social Impact
of Documentary Film (50 students for a course with a cap of 20),
and RUS-195-01, ST: Soviet Food Culture, with an incredible 67
students in a course with a cap of 15.  I think it's cool that a
course taught by a CS alum has so many students.  Since it's a short
course, perhaps the Wilson program can fund two sections this
semester.  What about the Food Course?  It's wonderful that they
have a course to take advantage of the new international kitchen
in the HSSC.  I'm pretty sure that it can't take more than fifteen
students.  And the Monday, 7:00-9:50 slot is really the only one
that works for that type of course.  I wonder what Todd will do.

I am interested to see the increasing number of courses offered in
the Monday evening slot.  In addition to those two over-enrolled
courses, as well as the music ensembles traditionally offered on
Monday evenings [9], we are also offering: a Peace and Conflict
Studies special topic course on Mediation and Conflict Transformation
for Leadership; a Wilson course on the SPARK challenge; a Theatre
course on Stage and Production management; Scholar's Seminar [10];
Dean's writing seminar on writing television scripts [11]; and
another creative writing course, this time on writing in German.

---

You know what?  I can't help but look at a bit more enrollment data.
CS will have some cutting, closing, and balancing to do.  But I'll
write about that [separately](ccb-2019-11-18).  What other departments
look stressed?  Let's take a look at the Department of Mathematics
and Statistics.  There's only one section of Calc. I offered, and that
is over-enrolled by 2 with a cap of 32.  I assume Royce will allow those
extra two students in.  One section of Calc II is over-enrolled by 2,
but one has two slots, and another section has sixteen slots.  Strangely
enough, the same person is teaching the over-enrolled section and the
one with 16 open slots.  I should return to the issue of time.

I had seen that one section of Linear Algebra was over-enrolled by
nineteen, even with a cap of twenty-eight.  But the 8:00 a.m. section
has more than enough slots to cover those students.  I guess there's
a question of whether anyone is up to learning Linear that early
in the morning [12].

On to the first real problem: MAT-218-01, Combinatorics and Number
Theory, is over-enrolled by eleven students.  Since 218 is a bridge
to the upper-division math classes, you can't really drop students
from it.  There is room in MAT-218-02.  However, that course has a
very different subject, Geometry, and there may be reasons for
students to have a natural preference for Combinatorics and Number
Theory.  For example, that's a much better combination [14] for CS
majors.

We'll conclude the Math side with my biggest concerns, the two core
300-level courses.  MAT-316, Foundations of Analysis, has thirty-five
students in a course capped at twenty.  Since that's a proof-writing
course, they can't really over-enroll the course.  Since it's a
required course, they can't easily drop students.  MAT-321, Foundations
of Abstract Algebra, is in nearly as bad shape, with twenty-nine
students in a course capped at twenty.  Again, it's not a course
that they can easily cut students from.  If it were me, I'd find a
way to offer another section of one of the courses and hope that
things balanced out.  There is, unfortunately, one more issue on
the Math side: There are nineteen students enrolled in MAT-322,
Algebraic Graph Theory, which has a cap of twelve.  Since MAT-321/322
is one of the common sequences, I assume they need to find a way
to make room for those students.  How will they do so?  We shall
see.

How are things on the statistics side?  Well, STA-209-04 is one of
the most over-enrolled courses at the College, with sixty-nine
students in a course capped at twenty-six.  Section 1 is over-enrolled
by six students.  In contrast, there are twenty-one slots available
between sections 2 and 3.  That's not enough to cover the over-enrollment
by forty-nine students.  In fact, it still leaves twenty-eight
students uncovered.  Conveniently enough, that's enough for another
section.  I wonder if there's a way to free or hire someone to teach
that.

Next up in Statistics, the new STA-230, Introduction to Data Science.
There are two sections of that course, each with a cap of 18.  One
is over-enrolled by nine students, the other by ten.  There's enough
interest for them to offer another section of that course, too.
The 300-level stats classes appear to be at or slightly above
capacity.  Whee!

Now, I suppose you're thinking that with demand for at least two
more classes in Math and two in Stats, there's evidence that
Math/Stats needs another position.  But things aren't quite that
simple.  There's no reason to believe that a Mathematician can
easily teach an upper-level Stats class or vice versa.  They are
simply two fields that share one department.  If we saw similar
needs in French and Arabic, we wouldn't try to hire one person to
cover both languages.

As I look again, I find myself getting a bit more nervous about
Statistics.  Pam's teaching.  Shonda's teaching.  Jeff's teaching.
And two visitors are teaching.  So we seem under-staffed with two
visitors in place.  Stats needs another tenure-line position as
much as Art does.  And when they hit four tenure-line statisticians,
I wonder whether Math/Stats will fissure, just like Math/CS did [15].

Okay, that's enough on over-enrolled courses.  Let's return to the 
question that got implicitly raised in looking at Calc II: What are
more and less popular times?  We're going to limit our exploration
to courses that offer two sections taught by the same faculty member.
What are those classes, and what do we see?

* Fredo Rivera is teaching two sections of ART-103, Introduction to
  Art History.  The 11:00 a.m. MWF section has 22 students enrolled.
  The 3:00 p.m. MWF section has 11 students enrolled.  It appears that
  students would prefer something outside of the 3:00 p.m. slot.
  Alternately, there are students taking classes with a lab in
  the afternoon, or afternoon seminars.
* Kathranne Knight is teaching two sections of ART-111, Introduction 
  to the Studio.  The 10:00 a.m. TuTh section has 54 students
  pre-enrolled.  The 1:00 p.m. TuTh section has 42 students.  I'm
  not sure whether these numbers are high enough that they are not
  informative, but we see another preference toward morning offerings.
* Jeremy Chen is teaching two sections of ART-134, Drawing.  The
  10:00 am MW course has twenty students enrolled; the 1:00 pm MW
  course has 41 students.    That seems to be a preference for
  afternoonofferings.
* Ben DeRidder is teaching two sections of BCM-262L, the lab for
  Introduction to Biological Chemistry.  I'm not sure that lab
  enrollments are as informative as course enrollments, but I note
  that there are seven students enrolled in his 8:00 am Thursday
  lab and nineteen in his 1:00 pm Thursday lab.  Is the difference
  due to conflict with Tuesday/Thursday seminar, because students
  like to sleep in on Thursday mornings, because students know
  labs tend to go long, because the expectation is that labs are
  in the afternoon, or something else?
* Clark Lindgren is teaching two sections of BIO-363L, Neurobiology
  Lab.  The Wednesday afternoon section currently has twenty students.
  The Friday afternoon section currently has twelve.  I'm not
  surprised that students prefer Wednesdays to Fridays, but I am
  surprised at how many would choose the Friday lab.
* Lin Liu is teaching two sections of CHI-102L, Beginning Chinese II
  Lab [16].  The 10:00 a.m. TuTh section has twelve students.  The
  2:00 p.m. TuTh section has eight.  A slight preference for morning
  sections on Tuesday/Thursday.
* Heriberto Hernandez is teaching two sections of CHM-129L, the
  General Chemistry Lab.  The Thursday afternoon section has thirty-five
  students.  The Friday afternoon section has eight.  As I suggested,
  Friday afternoon labs are likely to be less popular because they
  cut into the weekend.
* Stephen Sieck is teaching two sections of CHM-222L, the Organic Chemistry
  II Lab [17].  His Thursday 8:00 a.m. section has eight students.  His
  Friday 1:00 p.m. section has ten students.  Those two are close
  enough that I won't try to do any analysis.
* Elaine Marzluff is teaching two sections of CHM-363L.  There are
  ten students in the Thursday afternoon lab and eight in the
  Friday afternoon lab.  Again, those numbers are close enough that
  I would not make any conclusions based on the difference.
* John Stone is teaching two sections of CSC-161, Imperative Problem
  Solving with Lab [18].  The 8:30-9:50 a.m. MWF section has twenty-nine
  students enrolled.  The 1:00-2:20 p.m. MWF section has thirty-nine
  students enrolled.  I wonder why afternoon wins.
* Fahmida Hamid is teaching two sections of CSC-207-01, Object-Oriented
  Problem Solving, Data Structures, and Algorithms [20].  The 10:00-11:20
  a.m. MWF section has twelve students enrolled.  The 1:00-2:20 MWF section
  has twenty-five students.  I don't understand why afternoon is so much
  more popular in this case, but it clearly is.
* Shervin Hajiamini is teaching two sections of Operating Systems and
  Parallel Algorithms with Lab.  The morning one, which is 10:00-11:50
  a.m. MWF, has thirty students.  The afternoon section, which is
  2:00-3:50 p.m., has twenty-five students.  I'm beginning to reach
  the conclusion that CS students prefer the afternoon.
* Nicole Eikmeier is teaching two sections of CSC-301, Analysis of
  Algorithms.  Both the 8:00 a.m. and the 1:00 p.m. section have
  fifteen students.  There goes my conclusion.
* Eric Ohrn is teaching two sections of ECN-111, Introduction to
  Economics.  There are only five students in the 8:00 a.m. MWF section,
  but there are thirty-two in the 1:00 p.m. TuTh section.  Is that a 
  time preference or a day of week preference?
* Keith Brouhle is teaching two sections of ECN-280, Microeconomic
  Analysis.  The 10:00 a.m. MWF section has twenty-seven students.
  The 11:00 a.m. MWF section has only fourteen.  What a difference
  an hour makes.  I've been told that 10:00 and 11:00 MWF are the
  two most popular times.  I wonder why 10:00 wins (loses?) in this case.
* Logan Lee is teaching two sections of ECN-286, Econometrics.  The 
  8:00-9:50 a.m. MW course has twenty-eight students.  The 10:00-11:50 a.m.
  MW section has thirteen.  How did Logan get permission to teach
  two morning sections?  And, come to think of it, how did Keith?  I
  thought "If thou offerest two sections of the same course, thou
  shalt offer one in the morning and one in the afternoon" was one of
  the policies the Registrar imposed from on high.  In any case, I
  expect that the 10:00-11:50 section is more likely to conflict with
  other courses, which outweighs the "we don't want to wake up for
  an 8:00 a.m. class" perspective.

Are you getting bored with these data yet?  I may be.  but I feel
an obligation to finish.  And I've learned two interesting things:
The Registrar's office does not enforce its policies uniformly and
I seem to have been incorrect in my assumption that we should offer
CS courses preferentially in the morning because it frees science
students for afternoon lab.  So let's soldier on.

* Sejal Sutaria is teaching two sections of ENG-120, Literary Analysis.
  There are eleven students in the 9:00 a.m. section and seven in the
  11:00 a.m. section.  I also note that four of the five sections of
  Literary Analysis seem to be in the morning [21].
* Theresa Marx is teaching four sections of GRM-102L, Continuing 
  German Lab [22].  There are twelve in the Thursday 10:00 a.m. section,
  four in the Thursday 11;00 a.m. section, one in the Friday 1:00
  p.m. section, and none in the Friday 3:00 p.m. section.  That
  last bit is surprising.  But the class at 11:00 a.m. Thursday
  is.  I thought no classes were allowed at 11:00 a.m. on Thursday.
* Dan Reynolds is teaching four sections of GRM-222L, Continuing
  German II Lab.  The section at 10:00 a.m. Thursday has three students.
  The section at 1:00 p.m. Thursday has two students.  The section
  at 8:00 a.m. Friday has two students, and the section at 11:00 a.m.
  Friday has no students.  I'm glad to see that German offers students
  multiple options, which makes conflicts less likely.  And it's a lab,
  so I'm not going to try to make any conclusions.
* Mariko Schimmel is teaching two sections of JPN-102, Beginning
  Japanese II.  The 10:00 a.m. MWF section has fifteen students.  The
  2:00 p.m. MWF section has eleven students.  I see a slight preference
  for the morning.
* Etsuko Onitake is teaching two sections of JPN-102L.  The 10:00 a.m.
  TuTh section has nineteen students.  The 2:00 p.m. TuTh section has
  seven students.  That's a clear shift to the morning from the
  class distribution.  Room for Tuesday/Thursday afternoon seminars?
  I'm not sure.
* Brock Schmutzler is teaching two sections of MAT-133, Calculus II.  The
  MWF 1:00-2:20 section has thirty-four students.  The 2:30-3:50 p.m.
  section has only sixteen.  Is that the curse of Friday afternoon
  courses, or something else?
* Gene Gaub is teaching two sections of MUS-112, Music Theory I lab.
  The 10:00 a.m. Tuesday section has seven students.  The 3:00 p.m.
  Tuesday section has eleven students.
* Andi Tracy is teaching two sections of NRS-250L, Neuroscience Lab.
  The Wednesday afternoon lab has twelve students.  The Thursday
  afternoon lab has fourteen students.  There's not enough difference
  to analyze.
* David Zeiss is teaching two sections of PHE-100-19, Rock Climbing.
  Both are at the same time.  I assume that 19A is in the first half
  of the semester and 19B is in the second half of the semester.  There
  are seventeen students in the early-semester section and only four
  in the late-semester section.
* Johanna Meehan is teaching two sections of PHI-111, Introduction to
  Philosophy.  There are eighteen students in the 11:00 a.m. MWF section
  and eleven in the 3:00 p.m. MWF section.   I'm guessing that the
  difference is due to the "avoid Friday afternoon" preference, or
  perhaps just a reluctance to take 3:00 p.m. classes.
* Charlotte Christensen is teaching two sections of PHY-132L.  Both
  the Wednesday afternoon and Thursday afternoon sections have fifteen
  students.
* Danielle Lussier is teaching two sections of POL-101, Introduction
  to Political Science.  There are thirty-two students in the 1:00 p.m.
  MWF section.  There are only fourteen in the 3:00 p.m. MWF section.
  I think we're seeing a trend here.
* Jennifer Snook is teaching two sections of SOC-111, Introduction
  to Sociology.  The 9:00 a.m. MWF section has fourteen students.
  The 11:00 a.m. section has sixteen students.  That's close enough
  that I won't draw any conclusions.
* Chris Olsen is teaching two sections of STA-209, Applied Statistics.
  The 8:30-9:50 a.m. MWF section has thirty-two students enrolled.
  The 10:00-11:20 a.m. MWF section has ten.  Why?  I'm sure that
  Chris could help me with some informative statistical analyses.
* Shonda Kuiper is teaching two sections of STA-230, Introduction
  to Data Science.  The 8:30-9:50 a.m. TuTh section has twenty-seven
  students.  The 1:00-2:20 TuTh section has twenty-eight.
* David Perez is teaching two sections of WRT-101.  The 10:00-10:50
  a.m. Tuesday section has five students.  The 1:00-1:50 Wednesday
  section has one student.  I can't separate the day of the week
  from the time of day.

And that's all I found.  There may have been more.  Did you learn
anything from these data?  I had my assumption about afternoon
classes confirmed; students seem to avoid Friday late afternoon
classes, which also means that they avoid MWF 3:00-3:50 classes.

Do I have anything else to report about this year's preregistration
data?  No, I think that's enough for now.  I may return to the
post-cut-close-balance data to reflect on what happened next.  Or
that may be enough for this semester. We'll see.  And, as I've
suggested, you can also look at [the
data](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/) and
make your own conclusions.  But be careful, the data are likely to
change soon.

---

[1] I believe we've officially changed the name to "Open Registration".

[2] I've forgotten whether prereg ends at 5 p.m .or midnight on Thursday.  
It used to end at 5 p.m., but I seem to recall that we made changes in recent
years.  Ah!  The email message I have from the Registrar's office says
that it ends at midnight.  So I guess things can change a bit from
6 p.m. on Thursday, when I started writing this musing.  *C'est
la vie*.

[3] More accurately, registration for everything other than a student's
first semester, or when they're returning from leave.

[4] Or, more precisely, department abbreviation.

[5] Yes, I realize that we can find talented MFA students from UIowa
at relatively affordable prices.  But that's not particularly ethical.

[6] I realize that the demand would not be as high if they came closer
to meeting demand each semester.  But I'm pretty sure that the demand
would still be enough to warrant another faculty member.

[7] That's right, you should refer to it as "Biological Chemistry",
not "BioChem".

[8] Or lowlights, as it were.

[9] Perhaps just "music ensemble", in the singular.  The only one
I see right now is the Oratorio Society.

[10] For those not aware of Scholar's seminar, here's the description.

> This discussion seminar focuses on current theories of learning
and on the personal and environmental factors that impact the
learning process. Students will research and practice evidence-based
strategies and apply them to their existing courses with opportunities
for reflection and feedback. Open to all students. Grading scale
is S/D/F. Prerequisite: None.

That sounds like a good use of a student's time.  And it only meets
for the first half of the semester.

[11] I'm surprised that Dean's course has not over-enrolled.

[12] I acknowledge that there are some morning people out there.
I used to be one of them.  But I'm pretty sure that there are studies
that show that those in their late teens and early twenties do less
well in the early morning.  I am aware that 8:00 a.m. is not all
that early.  But it's early enough to have an effect.  I'll let you
do the Web search for the appropriate studies.

[14] No pun intended.

[15] We did not split Math and CS because of the number of CS
faculty.  We split because it was clear that the two halves of the
department functioned very differently and had different needs and
interests.  It helped that we were moving to separate floors, which
made acting as a single unit ever harder.  Some College policies,
which effectively penalized students who had an interest in both
CS and Math, also gave us incentives to split.

[16] It does seem that we're getting a bunch of labs in a row.  However,
Chinese lab is two days a week, and so more like a regular course.

[17] Will the labs ever stop?  I'll admit that teaching two sections
of lab is more likely than teaching two sections of most courses.

[18] If it's "with lab", why don't we get credit for teaching the
lab [19]?

[19] That was a rhetorical question.

[20] We have some long course names in CS.

[21] Admittedly, one is on Tuesday/Thursday morning.

[22] Yup, we're back to labs.

*Version 1.0 of 2019-11-17.*

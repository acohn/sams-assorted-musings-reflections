Meal plan pricing (2019 edition)
================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants) (mild), Grinnell*

Some time ago, in [musing #161](meal-plan-pricing), I ranted about the
pricing of meal plans.  As a Grinnell parent, I continue to worry about
the costs of our meal plans.  And, since I regularly hear from students
that they find it much cheaper to live off campus, I worry about the
effects of those plans on the financial accessibility of Grinnell,
particularly as Grinnell considers building more housing to reduce the
number of students who live off campus [1].  I also recall that my meal
plan musing was one that students commented on last spring.

It's now a few years later.  It seems worthwhile looking at how things
have changed.  Let's start with prices.  I've taken the current meal
prices from <https://www.grinnell.edu/life-grinnell/campus-living/dining/dining-plans-and-pricing> and the plan prices from <https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/CS/Dining/SitePages/Student%20Meal%20Plan%20Options.aspx> [2].

*Breakfast* was $8.75 in 2016-17 and is now $10.00 in 2019-20.  That's an
increase of over 14% in three years.

*Light breakfast* was $6.75 in 2016-17 and is now $7.00 in 2019-20.  That's
an increase of only 3.5%.  Let's hear it for consistent increases!

*Lunch/Brunch* was $11.00 in 2016-17 and is now $13.00 in 2019-20.
That's an increase of about 18% over three years.

*Light lunch* was $9.75 in 2016-17 and is now $11.00.  A comparatively low
increase of about 12.8%.

*Dinner* was $14.00 in 2016-17 and is now $16.00.  That's an increase of
about 14%.

The standard three meals (breakfast, lunch dinner) totaled $33.75 per
day in 2016-17.  They now total $39.00.  That's an increase of slightly
less than 16%.  Scary!

What about the plans?  There are still nine plans, numbered 1 through
10 [3].

_Plan 1 - Full Meal Plan_ gives you twenty meals per week plus five guest
meals across the semester.  In 2016-17, it cost $3,161 per semester.
In 2019-20, it costs $3,507 per semester [4].  That's an increase of
almost 11%.  It's also what you get when you increase prices by exactly
3% each year.  How is the value?  If students eat the expected
meals (no "light" anything) for all fifteen weeks of the semester, My 
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10LaLSo37bnGC9mvJyI2EXLam4QQO4_pVlJWlBgDOrJI/edit?usp=sharing) suggests that this plan provides
good value over buying the individual meals, as those meals would cost
$4,025, $518 more.

This analysis, like the others below, assumes that students eat all the
available meals for fifteen weeks of the semester.  That's not quite
accurate, since students do miss meals.  It's also not quite accurate
in the other direction because meals are served before classes start
and, I believe, during part or all of fall break.  However, meals are
not served during spring break.

_Plan 2: Any Fifteen Meals Plus_ gives fifteen meals per week, $250
of dining dollars, and five guest meals.  I'm not sure that $250 is
a good trade-off for five meals per week [5].  The pricing and changes
in pricing are the same as in Plan 1.  The value is, of course, less 
good than Plan 1.  However, this time around, we are at least in a state
in which the cost of the plan is less than the value of the plan [6,7].

_Plan 3: Any Fifteen Meals_ is just like Plan 2, except it doesn't include
dining dollars.  You would assume that it would cost $250 less.  But it
doesn't.  This year's cost is $3,253 per semester, $254 less than Plan
2.  I believe that makes it an obviously better plan than Plan 2.  This
plan cost $2,920 three years ago.  The increase is a little over 11%.
This cost of this plan remains fairly close to the value of the plan.

_Plan 4: Any 12 Meals Plus_ has changed since three years ago.  The prior
plan gave ten meals per week, rather than twelve.  This plan gives you
twelve, along with $385 in Dining Dollars and five guest meals.  Since the
plan is different, it doesn't make sense to look at the increase in cost.
It is now $3,253 per semester.  As far as I can tell, the value of this
plan is $3,120, making its cost more than its value [8].

_Plan 5: 80 Meals Plus_.  That's eighty meals per semester plus $145 in
dining dollars.   Three years ago, it was $142 dining dollars.  The
price has gone from $1,212 to $1,370, an increase of about 13%.  What
about the value?  It's gone from $1,262 to $1,430, also an increase of 
about 13%.  It remains a reasonable deal, although not much of an
advantage over now plan whatsoever.

_Plan 6: 65 Meals Plus_.  This one includes $195 in Dining Dollars per 
semester.  It costs $1,235 per semester, $135 less than Plan 5.  Are
fifteen fewer meals and $50 more dining dollars worth the savings?
Almost certainly not.  Let's see .. the value is also $1235.  I guess
it's nice to see a perfectly priced plan for once.

_Plan 7: Lunch Bunch_.  Lunch five days per week.  This plan can be nice
for students who live off campus, since it makes it easier to socialize
at lunch time.  Its cost has gone from $767.00 to $929.00, an increase of
21%.  Ouch!  But its value, at $975, remains slightly higher than its cost.

_Plan 8: Dining Dollars Plus)_.  Not so surprisingly, $100 in Dining Dollars
remains $100 in Dining Dollars.

_Plan 10: No Board_.  Since you were probably bored by my analyses, I
assume you appreciate that title.

What have I learned from all of this?  We've increased our "at the door"
prices significantly over the past three years.  We've had much more
moderate increases in the prices of our meal plans.  That now makes
Plan 1 a comparatively good value and, as importantly, removes the *Meal
Plan Penalty* from Plans 2 and 3.  All three of those plans are
particularly good values in the fall for students who are staying on
campus for fall break [9].  On the other hand, I still don't understand why
Plan 4 continues to impose a penalty on students.
I also remain puzzled that, although we charge $39 per day for food,
when students travel we will only reimburse them up to $30 per day.

What else?  I suppose I should share the guidelines on what plans
students can choose.

> Individual meal plan options are determined by class standing and housing status.  First year students are required to participate in the Full Meal Plan (1) for their first semester, but may choose
between the Full Meal Plan (Plan 1) and the 15 Plus Meal Plan (Plan 2) for second semester. 

> Returning students have other options, based on housing status.  Students living in the residence halls may choose between Plans 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Students in Cowles Apartments are required to participate in a minimum of Plan 6.  All other students who reside in designated co-ops, campus houses, or who live off campus may choose any plan or may opt out by choosing No Board (Plan 10).  

I wonder what things will look like in a few years.

Postscript: The last time I mused about this subject, I spent a lot of
time writing to various folks about this and other related issues.  This
time, the prices generally made sense.  I may ask about Plan 4 at some
point, but it's not high on my priority list.

Postscript: Sometimes I worry that I get too enamored with data.

[1] At the opening Faculty Meeting, President Kington described concerns
about the number of students living off campus, including worries about the
quality of that housing.  I don't expect that we'll be creating more housing
immediately, but it's clearly in the longer-term plans.  I hope that when
we build new housing, we will build housing that does not require students
to be on the meal plans.

[2] I apologize that the prices are behind the GrinCo password wall.

[3] Ed Wood would continue to regret the lack of a Plan 9.

[4] Isn't that a terrifying number?

[5] Okay, I"m pretty sure that it's *not* a good trade-off, unless
you don't eat those five meals.  And, even if you don't eat those
five meals, I'm pretty sure that 75 outtakes are easily worth much 
more than $250.

[6] We assume that the door pricing of dining hall meals is their value.

[7] Three years ago, the total cost was more than the value.

[8] As I've said, I haven't counted the meals before the start of the
semester nor have I counted meals during break.  

[9] We really do need something better for students who stay on campus
during winter break and spring break.  Those are clearly the times of
greatest food insecurity for our students.

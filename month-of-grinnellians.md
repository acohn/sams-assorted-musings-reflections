A month of Grinnellians
=======================

As you have no doubt seen, I've written on a wide variety of topics.
(Well, maybe a limited variety: Grinnell college, computer science,
the joy of code, online teaching, a few people, lots of self-indulgent
stuff about myself or my life.)  This month, I'm going to try something a
little bit different.  Instead of allowing my muse completely free reign
[1], I will restrict myself to one general topic.  No, don't worry, I'm
not planning to try NaNoWriMo [2]; I'm not enough of a stylist to take
that on [3].  I'm doing something else.

In particular, I plan to try to write about a different Grinnellian
each day.  I've planned essays on some alums, some faculty (present and
former), some staff (present and former), and maybe even some students.

I think this will be an opportunity to challenge myself as a writer.
Profiles are not something I regularly write.  The few I've written were
harder than I expected.

My writing schedule may be a little bit off this month, since I do 
consider it appropriate to check in with a subject [4] before posting
what I've written about him, her, zir, or them.  Of course, I think
that applies primarily to living, non-public figures.  I can probably
write anything non-libelous about public figures.  And, in all but one
or two cases, I'm pretty sure that the non-living Grinnellians I might
write about are public figures [5].

I have a *much* longer list of Grinnellians I want to write about than
I can write about in a month.  And there are others not yet on my list.
My muse needs some choice!  Anyway, I apologize to those of you who
I won't get to this month.  Unless I discover that I really suck at
these profiles, or my readers revolt [7], I'll probably do this again
another month.

[1] I'm pretty sure it's "free reign" and not "free rain".

[2] National Novel Writing Month, for those of you who haven't been
paying attention.

[3] Although, now that I think about it, a novel in the form of a series
of essays by a curmudgeonly faculty might be an interesting idea.  But
wasn't there something like that already?  Certainly, *Dear Committee
Members* comes close, although that's a novel as a series of letters,
recommendation and otherwise.

[4] victim?

[5] I could try what some music sharing sites do: "If the subject of
this essay objects to it, send me a registered letter and I will
remove it [6]."

[6] I love the "it" at the end of that sentence.  "It" is a nice,
vague, pronoun.  I could, for example, remove the registered letter.

[7] It feels like there's a Groucho Marx joke somewhere there.

One hundred words.  That's how many Ralph says we should write about
one piece we read for each class.  Correction.  Professor Savarese,
at least until we graduate.  But I'll never graduate.  One hundred
seems so few.  I muse one thousand, daily.  Should we describe form,
structure, content?  All?  None?  Must we write in complete sentences,
show trains of thought, be articulate, demonstrate competence?  Can
we relay impressions?  Hard.  Challenging.  Short.  Experiment.
Plaid.  Do we strive for exactness?  Will ninety-nine do?  One
hundred and two?  Must we edit to get the count correct?  And if
we do not?  I should muse.

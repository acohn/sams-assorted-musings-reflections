Like most people these days, I've been trying to figure out what the
near future may bring.  As an academic and a parent of college-aged
children, I've been focusing on what the fall will bring.  Will we
get to see our students in person, will we return to online classes,
will we ... what?

Increasingly, I find myself doing the math, as it were.  That is, I'm
reflecting on the numbers and what affects those numbers.

Now, I'm not a biologist, nor am I an epidemiologist, nor a physician.
Hey, these days it's questionable whether I'm even considered a
mathematician, a statistician, or a scientist.  But I do pay attention
to what's happening, or at least I try to do.

Here's what I understand.  The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious.
Each person with it is likely to infect more than one other person,
hence the exponential growth curve we've all come to know and hate.
COVID-19, the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2, is fairly deadly
with an unknown mortality rate but one that seems to be somewhere
between 1% and 5%.  And even when it doesn't cause death, it can
also cause severe and permanent damage to the body.  Outcomes seem
to be worse for old fat men like me, but effects can be horrible
for people of any age, weight, and gender.  COVID-19 also seems to
have a long progression; people get bad, then better, then worse.
I've read that it can last up to four weeks.

I recall David Campbell at the College Town Hall saying something
like "The College is not a petri dish, it's an incubator."  As I
understand it, that means that the most likely way we can bring
large groups of people back together is if the members of those
groups are mostly immune to the virus so that it will not spread.
I don't know what number is associated with "mostly", whether it's
70% or 90% or even 50%.  But it's a lot.

Right now, the only way to become immune (or partially immune) to
the virus is to have it infect you and then recover.  It's not even
clear that recovering from COVID-19 conveys long-term immunity from
the disease or, if so, how long that term is.  A vaccine is in the
works, but vaccines take a long time to develop.  I gain some hope
from the significant resources (money, people, expertise) that are
being devoted to development.  But testing and verification take
time, as does creating enough doses.  I can't envision sufficient
doses being ready this fall.  I don't want to think about the
non-vaccine strategy; our hospitals don't have the resources for
it.

I suppose that there's another way that we could bring everyone
back to campus: There could be a "cure" for COVID-19, something
that reduces the amount of time for the progression of the disease,
that limits its impact, and that cuts its mortality rate significantly.
A lot of resources are being devoted to a cure.  Maybe we'll find
one.  But I think of another famous coronavirus (or, more precisely,
a disease caused by a coronavirus), the common cold.  As far as I
know, we've been looking for a cure for the common cold for longer
than I've been alive, with little success.

The percentage of people who must be immune, the time to develop a
vaccine, the likelihood of developing a cure, and everything else:
When I add it all up, I come up with a natural conclusion.  We will
be back to in-person classes by fall.

It will just be fall 2021.

If we're lucky.

**_Postscript_**: I realize that the "add it all up" is incorrect.
The items I'm discussing are different units and one would not just
add them together.  But I'm too lazy to come up with a formula, and,
in any case, it would unlikely to be a good one if I did [1].

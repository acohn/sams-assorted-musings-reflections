Football at Grinnell
====================

*Forthcoming.*

----

Notes

* I watch our team and I worry.  I don't worry that we lose, since there
  are other reasons to play.  I worry that we are so small that our players
  end up playing hurt, and get even more hurt.
* I'm not even sure why we have football.  (And I say this as a Chicago
  graduate.)
* Detour on Chicago.
* Long and hallowed tradition.
* First game West of the Mississipi (yup).

* But will we ever have enough players?  
* Hard enough to find/recruit students who can meet Grinnell's high academic standards, play football, and will come here without an academic scholarship.  (Beloit 23.)
* It looks like football is decreasing in America.  Our HS team has half as many players as it did when eldest was a freshman (about seven years ago).  The teams we are playing seem similar.

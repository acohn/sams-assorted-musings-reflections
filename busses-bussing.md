Busses and bussing
==================

*Topics/tags: [Language](index-language), short*

What's the plural of "bus"?  To most people, it's "buses".  To a few,
it seems to be "busses".

What's the plural of "buss"?  The only option seems to be "busses".
For clarity, we should reserve "busses" for *this* plural. 

Is the choice significant?  Not really [1].  Nonetheless, I find that I
want to correct those who use "busses" or "bussing" when they refer to
big vehicles rather than the act of affection.

In this matter, as in so many others, I was clearly influenced by my
mother, who, if I recall correctly, concluded one of her poems "I'm
pro bussing".

[1] I don't even know what the $p$-value would be.

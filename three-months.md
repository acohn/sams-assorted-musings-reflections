A Third Month of Daily Essays
=============================

I've now finished a third month of daily essays, and even made it past
100 essays.

* Don't write better, but possibly write faster.
* Permission to write mediocre essays.  It's helpful to know that I
  have to get something out, even if it's not perfect.
* Keep myself in a bit more control.
* Reflect better on some issues.
* Sometimes makes me happier.
* Better at letting the essay choose me. [Probably covered.]
* Learning more about my audience.  Not many people click the "Like" button,
  but I do seem to have a variety of readers.
* When I started, I had a list of thirty or so "natural" topics.  After
  three months and more than one-hundred essays, I now have a list of 
  more than 100 remaining topics, along with a list of Grinnellians.
* Revisiting topics.
    * Should restore some version of the Posse essay.
    * Less good experiences suggest that I may have to revisit the
      changing Grinnell essay.

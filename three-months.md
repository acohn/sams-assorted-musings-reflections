A Third Month of Daily Essays
=============================

I've now finished a third month of daily essays, and even made it past
100 essays.  It's time for me to reflect once again on what I've learned
in writing this next month of essays.

* Don't write better, but possibly write faster.  Maybe even type
  faster.  (Michelle's comment: "You wouldn't write nearly as much
  if you didn't type as fast as you do.")
* Endnotes (or are they footnotes?).  Sometimes I get a bit carried away
  with them, as you've seen recently, and will probably see in tomorrow's
  essay [sketched, and already has way too many digressions].  But the
  main essay (usually) succeeds on its own, so I don't feel so bad about
  the random, multi-step, asides.  (Actually, I think the endnotes carry
  a lot of my 'voice', as it were.)
* Occasionally a bit of an addiction.  "I just have to write a little
  bit more" or "come up with another topic for next week" or "add just
  three more endnotes".
* Permission to write mediocre essays.  It's helpful to know that I
  have to get something out, even if it's not perfect.
    * But what I think is mediocre is not necessarily what others think
      is mediocre.  My essay on [mastering
      Grinnell](mastering-grinnell.html), which I thought of as one of
      my worst, garnered a few serious compliments.
* Keep myself in a bit more control (is that about ranting or about
  the amount I write).
* Reflect better on some issues.  
* Sometimes makes me happier.  
* Better at letting the essay choose me. [Probably covered.]  
* Learning more about my audience.  Not many people click the "Like" button
  on Facebook, but I do seem to have a variety of readers.  Strange when
  people come up to me at football games and say that they are reading
  what I'm writing.
* Not always good at predicting workload.  Sometimes choose essays that
  I think I can write quickly, and end up spending three times as much
  time on them as I planned.
* When I started, I had a list of thirty or so "natural" topics.  After
  three months and more than one-hundred essays, I now have a list of
  more than 100 remaining topics, along with a list of Grinnellians.
* Getting contacted by a student who needed help.  
* Haven't deleted an essay since #3.  But do need to revisit topics.  
* Revisiting topics.
    * Should restore some version of the Posse essay.  
    * Less good experiences suggest that I may have to revisit the
      changing Grinnell essay.  (Of course, getting ready to write
      about MC reminds me that the College has always done some pretty
      crappy things.)

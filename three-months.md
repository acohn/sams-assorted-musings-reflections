A Third Month of Daily Essays
=============================

I've now finished a third month of daily essays, and even made it past
100 essays.

* Don't write better, but possibly write faster.
* Keep myself in a bit more control.
* Reflect better on some issues.
* Sometimes makes me happier.
* Better at letting the essay choose me.

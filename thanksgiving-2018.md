Thanksgiving 2018
=================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

Things to be thankful for today (and every day)

* My wonderful and supportive wife who impresses me each day with
  her commitment to helping those around her.
* My three incredible sons, each of which finds his own way to make
  me proud.  I was glad to have two of them home for Thanksgiving.  
  I wish the third could have been here.
* The forty-five or so years I got with the force of nature that was 
  my mother.  I wish we'd had more Thanksgivings together.  I'm glad that
  together and apart, we often found ways to invite others to join us.
* What's left of my family, including my cousins, who I don't talk to
  nearly enough, and my brother- and sister-in-law, who, among other
  things, are excellent travel companions.
* A group of friends who make me feel like family.  This year, I feel
  particularly thankful for two old friends who visited us in late summer
  and early fall and the family who invited us for Thanksgiving.
* A job that I enjoy, that lets me make a positive difference to some
  great young adults, and that compensates me well for those activities.
* Many of those young adults, who make their own difference.  
* Live music [1].  
* I have the opportunity to write each day and I have people who read
  what I write.
* A host of other things that I'm too lazy to write about.

This year, I'm also thankful that I did not have to have the dreaded
"political argument with an uncle" at Thanksgiving dinner.  But then
I'm rarely faced with such challenges.

Next year, I hope to add "having all three sons home for Thanksgiving"
and "hosting another morning of bagel making" to the list.

Some rough notes on Robert M. Hutchins and the Liberal Arts
===========================================================

As I prepare to teah a Tutorial provisionally entitled "Grinnell's Open
Curriculum and Liberal Arts Education in the Twenty-First Century", I'm
planning read a variety of texts, both classic and modern, on liberal
education.  One source is the writings of Robert M. Hutchins, who helped
shape the Chicago education under which I trained.

From _Some Observations on American Education_.

* p. ix: The view that I take of education is that expressed by
_The Economist_ [1], "Education is not the same thing as vocational
training.  It is worth while for its own sake, even if it never led
to earning of a single penny.  It is a basic right of the individual
that his or her mind should be developed as far as it proves itself
capable of education."
* p. ix: The United States is committed to education for all.  But it
seems to be drifting further and further away from the notion that
education is the development of the mind.  The great question of our
time is whether the two ideas, education for all and education for the
development of the mind, are incompatible.  I think they are not,
though I admit that the organization and administration of an
educational system based on these principles presents us with problems
entirely new.
* p. xi: If the aim of general education is vocational and technical
  training, what do we do with Whitehead's remark [2] that "there can be no
  successful democratic society till general education conveys a
  philosophyical outlook"?

[1] Hutchins provides the less-than-helpful footnote of "26 June 1954".

[2] Hutchins cits this as _Adventures of Ideas_, p. 125.

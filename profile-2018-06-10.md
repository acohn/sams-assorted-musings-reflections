Why me?

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

Recently, I received a strange phone call from Communications.  It went
something like this.

> We're trying a new approach to marketing the College.  We thought it
would be good to do short videos with faculty, staff, and students.  We're
creating a few to use as examples and your name came up as a good subject.

My first inclination was puzzlement.  Why would they want me to serve as
an example?  I'm not particularly photogenic.  And, while I love Grinnell,
I'm not necessarily the most articulate promoter of the College.  But I
try to support the College, so I said yes.

Then came the phone interview with the producer.  Some things went well.
"What do you think is special about a liberal arts education?"  I could
answer that.  Why are you at Grinnell?  I could answer that.  What do
you do in your spare time?  That was harder.  I have difficulty understanding
this strange concept known as spare time.  But I gave my normal canned
answer, which goes something like this.

> I spend time with my family.  I have three sons of whom I am very
proud and a wonderful wife.  We like to play board games together.
We also like to discuss a variety of topics.  I play board games
at other times, too.  This summer, I'm hosting [a weekly game
night](game-night-2017-08-02) to build community among the CS summer
students.  My wife says that I'm happiest when I'm making art; I
prefer sculpture.  And I read a lot.

But, well, it's a canned answer.  One of my three sons no longer
lives near us, so I don't play board games with him very often or
discuss topics with him.  We also don't find many times to play games
as a family.  But those who live in town do have dinner together fairly
regularly and do discuss or argue about a variety of things.  And,
while I love making art, I don't have nearly enough opportunities to
do so.  I find that art making requires large amounts of time and
sustained concentration.  I have neither.  Finally, while I love to read,
I don't have nearly as many opportunities as I'd like [1].

Then they said, "We'd like to videotape you making art".  There's
a problem there; I don't have a work in progress.  But, as I said,
I do what I can.  So on the day of the interview, I dug out one of
my old projects, found a way into the wood shop, and had some fun
with the power sander and a grinder.  I'd rather do a more thorough
piece.

When they asked about my non-academic pursuits in person, I added
one other thing.  "I write an essay each day."  That's clearly where
most of my "not working" time goes.  However, I don't think it would
be very interesting to watch my type on my computer.

They also asked, "Where do you like to hang out on campus when you're
not in class?"  They followed up with "We'd like to take pictures
of you somewhere that's not your office."  But, well, I hang out
in my office when I'm not in class.  I like my office.  I like being
able to see students when they walk by.  I like being available to
my students.  Why would I want to be somewhere else?

After some brainstorming, I replied, "Well, I do like to visit the gallery."
But they'd already been working with someone else associated with the
gallery.  So I added, "I sometimes hang out in the CS commons."

In the end, they did the interview in my office.  They agreed with
Crane Metamarketing that it has "interesting texture".  I even got
to do the interview at my laptop, which means that the interview
*should* include some of the stickers on my laptop [5].  I hope it
does.  We also talked a bit about the various conversation pieces
that exist in my office.

I *think* I was articulate enough.  The producer suggested I was.  But
I don't think they'll have very good pictures of me doing other things.
And, well, it makes me feel a bit boring.  My favorite place to work?
My office.  Favorite things to do?  Spend time with family and work with
students.  Oh, and write.  What kind of art am I making right now?  None.

Oh well.  I'm sure they'll find some other folks to profile.

Postscript: Someone suggested that Communications asked me to be
part of the video series so that I wouldn't critique it.  They
needn't have worried.  I generally support marketing strategies
that include the authentic voices of students, faculty, and staff.
I'd just prefer that they use students.  Or, well, anyone but me.

[1] Nonetheless, I was able to talk about the three books I read
most recently.  I said something like:

> I've recently finished _Homegoing_, which is the College's "Common
Read" for this coming fall [2].  It's clear that I need to reread
it, but I've loaned it out to my summer students.  Before that, I
read _Mindset_.  I started reading it to think about how it would
affect my teaching, but it's become something I want to talk to my
family about [3].  The father of one of my students is a mystery
writer.  I've recently started reading his mysteries about an LA
Detective and his dog [4].

[2] I went on to describe what our "Common Read" is.  I did not discuss
my concerns about how the "Common Read" is chosen.

[3] The Rebelsky family hopes to discuss it as the first entry in the
"Rebelsky Family Book Club" or something like that.  I believe _The Name
of the Wind_ will be the next entry in that club.

[4] Someday, I'd like to know the relationship between the published
names of his books and the working titles.  If I recall correctly, the
working titles are things like "the first year of my son's Grinnell
education" and "the garden in my backyard".

[5] The stickers currently include "Diversity Includes Disability",
Grinnell's squirrel-logo "I give" [6], the GitHub Octocat Rainbow
Pride Sticker [7], [csteachingtips.org](http://http://csteachingtips.org/),
[ethics.acm.org](https://ethics.acm.org), "[Hack
GC](https://hackgc.github.io/)" [8], "Teach Accessibility" [9], a
barely readable [Code.org](https://code.org) sticker, and a copyright
symbol with Mickey Mouse ears and a list of updated copyright
extensions for those ears.

[6] The words "I give" are immediately under the back end of the squirrel.
So I always say "While some people don't give a rat's ass, I give ..."

[7] Have they started making MicroOctocats?

[8] The HackGC sticker has [an awesome logo that Communications
banned](https://hackgc.github.io/img/hackGC.jpg).  I wonder what
Communications will do about that.

[9] Both "Diversity includes Disability" and "Teach Accessibility" come
from AccessComputing.

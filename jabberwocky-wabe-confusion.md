Confusion about Jabberwocky
===========================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short, rabbit holes*

As I mentioned in [an earlier musing](ykcowrebbaJ), I've been using
parts of _Through the Looking-Glass_ as examples in CSC 151, mostly
the parts near the poem "Jabberwocky".

Today I discovered an interesting thing.  I was looking through [one
online PDF](http://www.gasl.org/refbib/Carroll__Alice_1st.pdf) which
appears to have been published in 1872 in London by Macmillan and Co.
As far as I can tell, that's the first edition [1].  I was surprised to
discover that the first two lines read

> 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
> &nbsp; Did gyre and gimble in the wade;

Why was I surprised?  Because I've always heard it as "in the *wabe*".
However, given the "borogroves" issue [2], I wasn't certain.

So I went looking.

The Library of Congress has [a scan of a copy published in 1909 in New
York by Dodge Publishing Company](https://www.loc.gov/item/09016128/).
Conveniently, you can see [the individual
page](https://www.loc.gov/resource/dcmsiabooks.throughlookinggl00carr_5/?sp=35).
This edition reads

> 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
>  &nbsp; Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:

Hmmm.  This one has "wabe".  But it changes the semicolon to a colon.
Puzzling.

An [epub version that suggests some effort was
involved](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=69868)
has "wabe" and the semicolon.  The [Project Gutenberg
HTML](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12/12-h/12-h.htm) has "wabe" and the
semicolon.  However, Gutenberg does not have the semicolon in the
backwards text.

What about the backwards text in the others?  The LoC copy
has a colon in the backwards text.  And the one published by
Macmillan in 1872?  It has "<span style="transform: scale(-1, 1);
display:inline-block;">wabe;</span>", which is "wabe" backwards, with
a semicolon.

The closing stanza in that version reads

> 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
> &nbsp; Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;

That's enough evidence for me.  I'm guessing that the first "wade"
was a typo, perhaps spurred by the mirror-image text from earlier.
I'm sticking with "wabe".

Postscript: Somewhere along the line, I
discovered that there's a [functional programming language called
Alice](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/papers/Rossberg,%20Le%20Botlan,%20Tack,%20Brunklaus,%20Smolka%20-%20Alice%20Through%20the%20Looking%20Glass.pdf).
I knew about [the graphical object-oriented language called Alice](https://www.alice.org/) and its variants, like Storytelling Alice.  But I hadn't
known about the functional language.

Postscript: It seems somehow appropriate that an issue pertaining to
a Lewis Carroll book sent me down an Internet rabbit hole.

[1] A [seemingly authoritative page about the book](http://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/resources/background/through-the-looking-glass/) says 

> Through the Looking Glass and what Alice found there” was published in December 1871 (but was dated 1872).

[2] Although many people say "borogroves" [3], it is supposed to be "borogoves".

[3] I recall hearing a choral arrangement that used "borogroves"
and just spent way too much time looking for it.  However, both the
[René Clausen](https://sbmp.com/SR2.php?CatalogNumber=528) and [Sam
Pottle](https://www.jwpepper.com/Jabberwocky/3701687.item#/submit)
versions seem to use "borogoves" [4].  However, the Pottle version changes
"claws that catch" to "teeth that catch".  Why?

[4] I looked at and listened to a few others, too.  I think I've now
heard enough versions of Jabberwocky to last me for awhile.

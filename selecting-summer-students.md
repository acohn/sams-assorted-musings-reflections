Selecting summer students
=========================

There are certainly many reasons I am fortunate to teach at Grinnell, some
of which I have detailed [elsewhere](teaching-cs-at-grinnell).  One that
drew me to Grinnell was the support for student-faculty research projects.
It's not that I want cheap smart labor; rather, it's that I think some
of my most important teaching happens when I work with summer students.
Because Grinnell provides summer research students with a small stipend
[1] and academic credit, students are generally able to choose to do
summer research regardless of their financial situation [2,4].

Why is summer research some of my most important teaching?  Primarily

---

[1] I think it ends up being $8.50 per hour, which is enough for most
students to get by for the summer, but is also certainly less than
students get for working on NSF REU projects.

[2] Grinnell also has a process by which high-need students can be
exempt from the summer contribution if they do research at Grinnell;
that process is way too opaque [3].

[3] It used to be that every student who did summer research had their
contribution waived, but I don't think that's the case.  I probably need
to draft a note about the need for that process to be more transparent.

[4] There is evidence that cultural factors lead some students,
particularly first-generation college students, to avoid summer
opportunities like interships and research because their families
do not understand the long-term benefits of those opportunities.
In order to address those issues, we need to start by making sure that
students get paid for the work.

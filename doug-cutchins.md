Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Doug Cutchins '93
===============================================================

*Part of an ongoing series about the folks who once inhabited or who
currently inhabit the former Iowa College of Grinnell.*

If it were four years ago, I probably wouldn't have had to introduce Doug
Cutchins '93 to any then-current students (or alumni from the prior
decade), as Doug was an active and important member of the College staff.
A year ago, it's pretty clear that I would have had to introduce Doug
to almost any current student, since he is now something like half
a world away.  But in the past year, he's connected with the College
in two very public ways, through a video on Posse and "that essay".
Particularly because of the essay, many Grinnellians think they know
about Doug.  Unfortunately, what they think they know is probably wrong.
I won't claim that I know nearly as much as I should know about Doug,
but I do know many things, and he's someone I'm proud to have as a
Grinnell alum and as a former colleague.

I should probably know what Doug did between graduating from Grinnell
and then coming back to serve in the Career Development Office [1].
I know he married Anne Geissinger '93.  I know that he contributed to
a book on "Volunteer Vacations" [3].  I believe he spent some time in
the Peace Corps.  

In any case, he came back to Grinnell in 1999 or so.  Doug did a variety
of things at Grinnell.  He was the primary contact person [4] for our
competitive national post-graduate scholarships [5].  In that role, he
encouraged faculty to nominate students, he encouraged students to
develop applications, he helped students develop those applications,
he helped faculty write recommendation letters, and more.  But Doug
also advised students in myriad other ways, helping them think about
not only their time at Grinnell, but the options they had after Grinnell.
He was a person that our students loved (and, presumably, still love).
Like most Grinnellians, he cared (and cares) deeply about social 
justice issues and thought about what his role in the world should be.

Doug's concerns for our students came out in multiple ways.  He was
active with students and alums on social media (and one of the few folks
on campus comfortable conversing with students on Plans).  He regularly
worked on ways to help support students, particularly during the week
formerly known as "male pronoun double hockey sticks" week [6], as well
as finals week.  Each semester, Doug organized a "You can do it" march
during one of those two weeks.

In spit of my generally combative personality, I don't think I ever
found fault with anything Doug did while on campus.  He was sincere
about helping Grinnell students (both directly and indirectly), about
making the College more socially responsible, and in supporting our
alumni.  What more could one ask?  My closest connections with Doug
were in working with my students on fellowship applications, on working
together on the [SHACS review](http://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/SHACS%20review%202013%20FINAL.pdf) [8], and, when I could find the
time, in doing the "You can do it" march.

In retrospect, I didn't get to know Doug nearly well enough during his
fifteen or so years at Grinnell.  Michelle and Anne were friends, having
bounded over the joy of staying in a four-story walkup when they were
both pregnant and participating in a College trip to London.  My youngest
and their oldest were classmates (and even danced together for a bit).
But Doug and I mostly communicated via email and Plans, with the occasional
in-person meeting.  I think we both respected each other as members of
the community who cared deeply about our community, but we did so mostly
in tandem, rather than together.

I wish I could have better written about the reasons Doug made such
a positive difference to this place we both love.  I look forward to
seeing Doug continue to re-engage with Grinnell.

[1] CDO, for old-timers.  The predecessor to CLS, for new-timers [2].

[2] What?  You say that "new-timers" isn't a term?  What would you use?

[3] I wonder what Doug thinks about the current controversies about
"service tourism", or whatever they call it.  Given the reaction to
his recent essay, I wouldn't expect him to write about another
controversial issue, so perhaps I'll never know.

[4] Okay, "contact person" is probably the wrong word.  "Cheerleader",
maybe.  "Encourager of students", perhaps.  "Officer", too formal.
"Guide", better.  Well, I'll stick with "contact person".

[5] Kind of like the position that the differently awesome Steve
Gump is now in.  However, I think they split Doug's position into
two or three positions.

[6] Or perhaps Happy Exciting Liberal Learning week [7].

[7] Sorry Jen.

[8] Yeah, we got to write a report on SHACS that appears to have had no
direct impact.  I sometimes wonder whether anyone ever read it.

[9] I have no idea how to fit this in my essay, but I think Doug did
not realize how difficult irony is in a country in which candidates for
presidential office could say the kinds of things they did this year [9].

Many people don't read footnotes, or don't read them immediately.

I appear to be overly precise on citations.  My peers tended to give
author and title.  I gave author, title, source.  I often looked for
the original source.  Does it matter?  It does to me.

I struggle to write lyrical, descriptive prose.  Most of my peers excel
at such prose.  Some tell me they've had a lifetime to learn [1].  

Nonetheless, I can write some really nice sentences if I try hard
enough.  It may even bet getting easier.

I have trouble keeping my mouth shut [2,3].

New words. Hypotaxis. Parataxis. Those two are Greek to me.
Pathography.

I use fairly few sentence structures in my typical musings.

I have a voice that seems to have been formed in these many musings.
It appears to carry through, no matter what type of piece I write.
Or perhaps I just imagine that.  If it's there, and I think it is,
I like that voice.

It takes a long time for me to write intentionally, as opposed
to instructionally, introspectively [4], or irritablly [5].

Even though my writing slowed for my workshop pieces, I can still
spew text as necessary.  Is spew the best word?  I suppose so.

Most people don't immediately hear songs when they see words that
might be lyrics.  "Barstow, San Bernadino"?  It's "Route 66" [6]
[7].  "Run, Rudolph, Run"?  I've always thought of it as "Run, Run,
Rudoplh", but it's a song by Chuck Berry. Maybe the writers don't
intend those connections.

I cannot critique quickly.

We call it a workshop for a reason.

[1] A shorter lifetime than mine, to be sure.

[2] Or my fingers still, when there's a chat box open in our remote
learning environment.

[3] I suppose I knew that already.

[4] Musings.

[5] Rants.

[6] Get your trips.

[7] Wasn't that 666 a nice coincidence?

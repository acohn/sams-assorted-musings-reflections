As I've noted before, one of my too-many responsibilities is serving
as the moderator for the SIGCSE [1] listservs [2].  As moderator, I
get a message for each post.  I can approve by clicking a link.  But
not all messages should be approved.  Some violate our policies.  Some
need feedback from the SIGCSE Board or SIGCSE Chair.  And then there
are the ones like this.

```
This  message was  originally  submitted by  someperson@SOMESCHOOL.EDU to  the
SIGCSE-members list  at LISTSERV.ACM.ORG. You  can approve it using  the "OK"
mechanism (click on the link below), ignore it, or repost an edited copy. The
message will expire automatically. You do not need to do anything if you just
want to discard it.

Apple Mail sent this email to unsubscribe from the message “Re: [External] Re: [SIGCSE-members] Editor recommendation”.

Those are frustrating.  Why?  In part, it's because it's hard to be sure
whether or not it's intentional.  Too often, it seems that people hit the
"Unsubscribe" button on their mail reader accidentally.  It turns out that
it was the case for this message.

More importantly, it's because **you do not unsubscribe from listserv lists
by sending a message like this**.  I don't blame the users; you should be
able to assume that your email client is correclty designed.  Listserv
has a protocol.  You'd think that the designers of an email reader
would know those protocols.  Instead, they waste my time.  How hard
is it to write correct software? [3]

I'd also hope that computer science educators would be polite enough
to determine the correct way to unsubscribe, or would at least send
a message, but that's another of my dashed hopes.

Oh well.  Only nine more months until the end of my second three-year
term.  I will not be permitted to re-up.  Since moderating is part of
my professional identity, I wonder what that will be like.  I guess
I'll learn.  And I'm glad that others will have the opportunity to
contribute to the SIGCSE community.

**_Postscript_**: Keep your eyes posted for the opportunity on the
SIGCSE-Volunteers list [4].

[1] Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education.

[2] We have four: SIGCSE-members, a place for general discussion
of CS education; SIGCSE-announce, where announcements from the
SIGCSE board and the Chairs of SIGCSE conferences appear; SIGCSE-jobs,
for job postings; and SIGCSE-volunteers, where volunteer opportunities
appear.  One of my accomplishments as moderator was to propose the
SIGCSE-jobs list, which I think has been a net positive.

[3] Admittedly, it turns out to be incredibly difficult to write
correct software.

[4] Like most volunteer opportunities, it will also appear on the
SIGCSE-members lists.

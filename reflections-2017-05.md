End-of-semester/beginning-of-summer reflections, Spring 2017
============================================================

_A few years ago, when the amazing [Karla Erickson](karla-erickson.html)
began her term as Associate Dean, she decided that part of her role would
be improving our support for what she called "mid-career faculty" [1].
One of the most tangible parts of that support are "reflection sessions"
that she holds at the beginning, middle, and end of each semester.
Although she is now stepping down as Associate Dean [3], she will be
continuing with these for the next few years.  I believe that mid-career
faculty have also become the population that she will be studying for
the next few years, since she's always had "sociology of work" as part
of her professional emphasis._

_I find these sessions valuable enough that I have encouraged Karla to
consider doing more than just her scholarship.  She should, for example,
set up a consulting practice and write some workbooks for those who cannot
attend her sessions.  I hope she takes those recommendations seriously._

_This musing represents an extended version of my responses to her prompts
at a recent session.  I have included her prompts so that you can consider 
doing a similar self assessment [4,6]._

**Let's start by taking three deep cleansing breaths.**

I tried typing "deep cleansing breaths" while taking them with my
eyes closed.  I got "Swwp xlwNAINF VEWrha".

**A few quick things: What is hanging over your head right now?**

Hmmm ... I wrote down "I am an idiot", "departmental pressures", and
"helping my kids do well".  I don't remember why I'm an idiot [7].  It's
likely that I have once again committed to too many activities.  We
also reviewed summer plans informally at some point during this session,
so it may just be that we saw that I've given myself very little break
time this summer.  I do have a variety of activities, but research
starts immediately after graduation and in the week and a half between 
the end of research and the start of the Grinnell Science Project, I'm
in workshops.

**Academics are prone to building time castles.  Be careful.**

I first thought that Karla said "time capsules" and couldn't figure out
what that meant [8].    But she said "time castles".  I think it means
that we build these intricate designs of how we will organize our time,
but they are not realistic.  I should ask.

**Okay, we're going to start by putting things into buckets.  Remember:
Your goal here is just to get things down, it is not to reflect or prioritize.
We'll reflect and prioritize next.**

**Bucket one: Deferred maintenance on self, family, and home.**

* I need to work on weight and health [9].
* I need to spend more time with Michelle and the boys.  Michelle and
  I promised ourselves a short walk after dinner each night.  The problem
  with that right now is that we're not doing normal dinners.
* I need to help youngest think through possible life paths.  What will
  be right for college?  What can he do to help prepare himself to get
  into the right college?
* I should help youngest with tennis, and maybe play a bit myself.
  (Slow, low impact tennis.)
* I need to help middle think more about the future.  He has some great
  passions and is being somewhat proactive about pursuing those, but it
  seems like he needs a bit more guidance.
* I need to straighten (home office, basement, bedroom, living room,
  family room, work office, work lab, computer, etc.).
* We need to work on the exterior of the house.  We've hired a contractor,
  but I should remind him.  We also need to hire a painter for once he's
  done.  Should we do something about the builder who didn't bother to
  put down primer, which led to all sorts of problems?  Probably not; he's
  out of state.
* Something weird happened to the roof of the garage.  We need to find
  someone to deal with that.
* The side-view mirror of my car is broken [10].  I have a replacement.
  I just need to find the time to replace it.
* There's something flapping underneath my car.  I should jack up the car
  and look at it.
* My car is starting to rust.  Do I want to try dealing with that, or 
  should I just let it rust away?  It's hard to hire people in town to
  do bodywork.
* Whoops!  I keep forgetting to deal with the drain by the driveway.
* We had to dig up our back yard last spring.  We need to reseed that.
* More generally, we need to work on landscaping.  I think Michelle has
  someone she wants to hire, since neither she nor I ever seems to get
  to this stuff.

In writing these down, I found myself getting very very anxious.  I suppose
there's a reason that some of this gets deferred, other than that my job
is busy and doesn't give me time to deal with everything.

Later in the session, I went back and added two more things.

* Get _Getting Things Done_ done.  I really do need a way to keep track
  and manage my tasks.
* Get Omnifocus set up.  Once I understand the approach, software should
  help.  Jerod will also be back some time this summer, and may be able
  to help.

**Bucket two: Writing and research.  It's time to think about getting
back in touch with existing and potential projects.**

I asked for (and received) permission to include class preparation here.
Karla also suggested that I include the daily musings in my writing and
research.

* Daily essays: Profiles series
* Daily essays: Finish the Cnix series (or at least progress)
* Daily essays: Start a Rails series?
* Daily essays: A class Web site: Jekyll, Bootstrap, and more
* Representations in code camps
* Design of code camp 1
* Design of code camp 2
* Papers on each of those
* Improved version of last summer's paper.
* Design of new CSC 151
* Department-level NSF proposal?  (Damn, what was that?)
* NSF proposal for digital humanities?
* Something on accessibility
* Rails stuff!  (Hidden in daily essays, but ...)

At that point, I decided that I had written enough.  Interestingly, I found
less anxiety here than in the home/personal stuff.  The quantity builds
some anxiety, but each of these are things that I am enthusiastic about [n]

[n] Part of my problem is that I am enthusiastic about too many things.

**Bucket three: Professional and pedagogical.  Think about what you
need to wrap up from spring and prepare for fall.**

Wrapping up

* Wrapping up 
   * Exams for 151
   * Grading for 151
   * Grading for 321 and 322
   * Letter to Jerod: Welcome to being a chair.  (Sections are a musing.)
   * Get department materials in order and write description.  (Also a musing?)
   * Plans for Sarah
   * Tapia/Hopper.
   * NCWIT!
   * List of responsibilities
   * Change size.

Preparing for fall

* Preparing for fall
   * Lots fell under scholarship - prep for 321, prep for new 151.
   * Finish details of site-building tool.
   * Support for Anya?  (What is necessary?)
   * Pedagogical workshop.

**Pick five things that need to be done for fall.**

* New CSC 151
* Weight and health (I keep saying that and I keep failing)
* Transition stuff for Jerod
* Course Web site stuff
* Set up for Tapia/Hopper/etc.
* Extra: Omnifocus

**Out of those five: How many days or parts of days do you need to dedicate?**

* New CSC 151: 42 days of class, about three hours prep per day.  One month of half days.
* Weight and health: One hour per day.
* Transition stuff for Jerod: About two full days.
* Course Web site stuff: About two full days.
* Set up for Tapia/Hopper/etc. About two days, distributed.
* "I'm screwed."

**Remember: The semester lingers. When will you be really done with the semester?**

Karla drew a nice chart of the decline in semester work and the increase [n]
in summer work.

[n] incline?

* Goal: June 5.
* Includes transition stuff for Jerod.
* Can we claim a little of the time this spring befoe then for these things.
* How much do I have to claim?
   * One hour per day for wellness, starting next week.
   * Walking with Michelle, starting today (?)
   * Four hours per day for students, starting next Tuesday.
   * One hour per day for transition stuff, starting next Tuesday.
   * A chunk for the course Web site stuff, if possible.
   * Tapia/Hopper?????
   * GTD/Omnifocus: 30 minutes per day starting Thursday?  (Yay evenings.)
   * Think about a one-pager for Jerod.

**What's easy to cut?**

Nothing  

**What's possible for you to cut.**

* Department-level NSF proposal?  (Damn, what was that?)
* NSF proposal for digital humanities?
* Not all of the papers need to be written.
* Something on accessibility (ouch ouch ouch / work with students)

**Let's consider a few other ideas.**

* Summer meeting?
* Think about putting a fence around things.
* What momentum would be good?

---

[1] Karla, being generous, considers anyone between tenure [2] and
Senior-Faculty Status to be a "mid-career" faculty member.

[2] Or promotion to Associate Professor, for those in departments which
do not award tenure.

[3] A loss to the faculty, but a gain to our students.

[4] If you are at Grinnell, you should attend one of Karla's sessions or
sign up for a one-on-one.  If you are not at Grinnell, you should consider
hiring Karla to come out and talk to your faculty.  I bet she might even
be willing to run a session via Skype [5].

[5] I received no compensation for that suggestions, other than the positive
feelings I get from knowing (or at least hoping) that others will benefit
from her expertise.

[6] Hmmm ... if she's going to write a book or workbook, does that mean
she'll be more protective of her intellectual property and will be unhappy
with me including the prompts in these musings?  Probably not.  Her work
will be much more thorough.

[7] Maybe that's because I'm an idiot.

[8] Maybe that's why I wrote down "I'm an idiot".

[9] I write that a lot.  Eventually, I'll write it enough that I'll
actually work on my weight and health.  I'm hoping that it's this summer.

[10] "shattered" might be the right word.  It's usable, but it's
pretty bad.

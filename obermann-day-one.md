The first day of my Obermann fellowship
=======================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), academia, digital humanities, long, rambly*

Today was my first day as a Digital Bridges Obermann Fellow at the
[Obermann Center for Advanced Studies](https://obermann.uiowa.edu/)
at the University of Iowa [1].  I'm still not sure what I was thinking
when I applied for this fellowship [2].  While I very much appreciate
the time to work carefully on course design, I'm a bit intimidated by
working as a fellow in a place like the center.  Although the [mission
statement](https://obermann.uiowa.edu/about/mission-overview) suggests
broad focus, it looks like most of the folks here are humanists, artists,
and social scientists [3,4].  And most are working on scholarly projects,
rather than pedagogical [5].  So I'm going to be a bit of an anomaly.
That's okay; I pretty sure that I'll both learn and accomplish a lot.

I had assumed I'd get a relatively small office; what I have is much
larger than I anticipated.

a large L-shaped desk, two file cabinets, a desk lamp, and a set of
empty bookshelves.">

The desk space seems way too big for my laptop.  Maybe I'll take my
hosts
up on the offer of external monitors.  Having more virtual desktop
space could be useful, particularly when I'm working on a reading, 
the corresponding lab, and the supporting code.  The bookshelves are
also way too empty.  I'll need to bring some books here.  But I don't
need the file cabinets, or at least I don't think I do.  Maybe one set
can serve as my desk drawers.

I've decided to begin my time at the center by making a list of my
preliminary priorities for the course creation and design.  I'm hoping
that this course design will be an agile process, with regular reflection
and re-design.  That process needs to start somewhere.  Let's see ...

I hope to meet with a variety of folks at UIowa to talk about possible
approaches to the course and key "skills" they might want to see a digital
humanist develop.  I know that I won't cover many of the particular
languages they'd prefer; I don't plan to teach PHP or Python or even
the details of XML.  But we can discuss broader issues of the kinds
of computational thinking that are useful in the digital humanities.
I expect that those conversations will be more fruitful once I have a
framework to base them on.  So I'll probably wait a week or two before
reaching out.  Fortunately, I have some notes about possible contacts
from the recent [Digital Bridges symposium](https://dbsymposium2018.com/).

I'd like to think about accessibility as I design the course.
UIowa also has the [Iowa Center for Assistive Technology Education and
Research](https://icater.education.uiowa.edu/) [6].  I wonder if it
would be fruitful to meet with someone from there?  Again, having
a basic framework would be helpful for that meeting.

Speaking of reaching out: I should also reach out to the CS department
at UIowa.  While I don't anticipate many collaborations with them
on this project, I should try to participate in some of their
activities to strengthen connections.  And I see that Obermann and
the CS department are co-sponsoring a talk on "[Appropriately Valuing
Interdisciplinary Research between Computer Science, Creativity, and
the Arts](https://obermann.uiowa.edu/events/latulipe)" this Friday.  I'll
certainly be there.  That may also be a good time to say hi to some folks.

One way I start to think about a course is by putting together the
schedule of topics.  My former colleague, Janet Davis, used to set up her 
course schedules
through a Post-it note system.  I've always been more comfortable
writing and rearranging text.  In any case, organizing the course
content is a high priority.  And, as I [recently
realized](csc151-datacsci-reflections), there's a lot I'm putting in
the course, or at least trying to put in the course.  The syllabus is
also a good starting point for conversations.  The last time I designed
a themed course, I did my best to put both CS topics and theme topics
in the "big picture" schedule of topics [7].

Since the materials for the course will effectively be a kind of book,
I will probably write an introduction for that book.  I realize that the
introduction should generally be the last thing one writes.  But I find
it useful to start with a draft introduction to ground my thinking and
then rewrite it at the end.

Come to think of it, once I've written those things, I should also write
a list of questions for the people I plan to talk to.  "Which of these
topics seem most/least relevant?"  "Would you expect dictionaries (hashes)
in the first course?"  "If you could choose one algorithm for the students
to learn, what would it be?"  "How useful do you consider XPath and
XSLT?"  Those kinds of things.

Before I start writing, I should reflect on the formatting system
or systems I want to use for the "book" and the course.  There are a
host of possibilities.  And it's painful to switch formatting systems.
So I need to reflect thoughtfully.  You can expect a musing with more
details in the near future.

I will eventually need to write some tools to help build the book.
I can't help it; I'm a programmer at heart and regularly find that I
want to write tools to make my life easier.  One particularly important
tool will turn the 6P-style formatting that I teach our students into
reference pages.  While that could be an end-of-semester project, I
know that my colleagues teaching CSC 151 this semester would like better
reference pages, so the documentation tool should be a high priority.

I need to expand my perspective on the digital humanities in multiple
ways.  Hence, I should start making a list of things to read.  After that,
I should start reading them [9].

Then there are the small things.  Find parking.  Done.  It looks
like I need to get here relatively early in the morning if I want
on-street parking.  Figure out how to connect to wireless.  Done.
Update my password.  Done.  Enable my online directory entry.  Done.
Figure out the email system.  That appears to require a message to the
ITS help desk; <https://office365.uiowa.edu> does not seem to provide
me with an email client.  Start musing.  Done.  Realize that I don't do
well working in relative silence and dig out earbuds.  Done.  Get an
ID card.  I'll wait until another day for that.  But at least I have
the instructions.

Much of my first day was spent thinking and writing and making this list.
But we also had a lunch of the Fellows and the Director followed by
an hour-or-so-long discussion.  While their areas are very different
than mine, they are working on some exciting projects; I look
forward to hearing more about them in the bi-weekly meetings.  And I'm
happy to see that each two week period is designed to feel a bit like a
sprint [10]: At the start of each meeting, we are to report on what we
accomplished over the past two-week period and to plan two tasks for
the next two-week period.

We also have presentations of work in progress.  I get two days to
present to the group at the bi-weekly meeting and to have them read a bit
in advance.  I'm trying to figure out what would be best to present to
people who aren't computer scientists.  Since I've made the (disposable)
introduction one of my initial priorities, that seems like a good starting
point.  I'm debating whether or not I should also provide the schedule
of topics; I expect that the schedule will make less sense to most of
these colleagues.  I'll have to think a bit more about what to do in that
first presentation.  For the second presentation, I think I'll use my
topic modeling/LDA [11] reading.  That's a complicated algorithm, and
my focus is to make the algorithm comprehensible to non-specialists.
It's also a case in which I think of the result of the algorithm as a
step in a broader process; the topics themselves are useful only in
what scholars do with them afterward.

For the first meeting, we gave two quick overviews of our projects: one
a few sentences long, one a few minutes long.  Providing the overviews also
reminded me of the pace I need to keep for this project.  I'm planning on
being at the Center for three or four days per week for fifteen weeks.
But I'll be away at a conference for one week and participating in a
department review another week.  So let's say that I'll be here for
about fifty days.  I'm planning to write about forty paired readings
and labs.  Each pair takes about a day if I'm efficient.  So I have ten
or so workdays to get ready for the intense writing and to do the other
affiliated tasks.  That doesn't seem like much.  But I'll make it fit.

What else?  Oh yeah, I had one brain freeze along the way.  A colleague
from Grinnell was chatting with me about the structure of the course
before the lunch meeting.  I was embarrassed to realize that I could not
remember the three parts of the course.  I recalled "structure" and
"analysis", since those correspond to "data structures" and "algorithms",
which are the core of CS.  Looking back on my notes, I see that I forgot
to include "generation".  I still need to figure out how to fit that
more clearly into the course.

And there you have it.  My first day as a fellow.  I wrote a bit.  I
planned a bit.  I met interesting people.  And I avoided freaking out
about the scale of the project and feeling like an anomaly.  That makes
it a pretty good day.

Plus they fed us good Thai food for lunch.

Postscript: Friday's cool talk came up at lunch.  Now I've been invited
to lunch with the speaker.  I'm excited!

[1] "First day" is a bit more complicated than it should be.  My
appointment officially started two days ago.  But Grinnell's semester
doesn't start for another week.  Since today is the first day of the
bi-weekly seminar at the Center, it seems appropriate to call it my
first day.

[2] That's not true.  I was thinking "It would be both fun and useful
to design a version of CSC 151 that focuses on the digital humanities"
and "It would be wonderful to have the time to sit down and work on such
a project".

[3] If I recall correctly, my fellow Fellows are in English, Sociology,
Music, Philosophy, American Studies, and Languages.

[4] Of course, they also sponsor the Humanities, Arts, Science, and
Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), which certainly includes the
kinds of things that I do.

[5] Actually, it sounds like every other project, while primarily scholarly,
also includes a pedagogical component.  And at least one other Fellow also
plans to develop a new course.

[6] Unfortunately, it sounds like ICATER is on the chopping block,
along with a variety of other valuable centers.  Let's hope people
find the sense to continue funding them.

[7] E.g., In the data science version, I might note that on the CS we
will cover list manipulation operations, such as filter and that on the
Data Science side we will discuss data cleaning [8].

[8] Ideally, we would also discuss the ethics of data cleaning.

[9] I have a colleague who told me that they plan to read one article or
book chapter each day of their sabbatical.  That sounds like a reasonable
plan.  (I don't know whether they plan to include weekends; I plan to
include only weekdays.)

[10] An agile sprint, not a racing sprint.

[11] Latent Dirichlet Analysis.

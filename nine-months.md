Nine months of daily musings
============================

Another month has passed.  It is hard to believe that I have been
writing a musing each day for nearly a full academic year.  If I remember
correctly, I ended last month somewhat frustrated that I was experiencing
writer's block and that I was writing too many introspective essays.
Let's consider how this month went.

I certainly enjoyed writing the first piece of the month, which was an
[April Fools Day essay](grinnell-trads-noyce-cooper).  I'm not sure that
"mediocre humor" is a new genre for me, but it was good to be able to
extend that approach to a full piece.  I particularly enjoyed writing the
long paragraph of corrections.  I did, however, find that I kept going back
and updating that essay.  I'd rather be able to leave them behind when
I finish.

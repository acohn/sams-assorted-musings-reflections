How (not) to adapt to the end of daylight saving time
=====================================================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

Yesterday, the period known as "daylight saving time" (which I tend to
mispronounce as "daylight savings time") came to an end.  At 2 a.m.,
clocks rolled back to 1 a.m. [1].  Whenever clocks switch from
standard time to savings time, or vice versa, it takes some time for
people's bodies to adapt.  I recall reading something last year that
the switch costs the economy about a half a billion dollars a year in
lost productivity [2].  That's a lot.

This year, Michelle and I tried a new strategy for adapting to the
change.  We volunteered to host the cast party for the recent high-school
play.  Here's the thing; they don't throw the cast party immediately
after the final performance.  Rather, they disassemble the set after
the final performance and *then* they have the cast party.  The show
ended up at 9:45 p.m. CDT.  It was a large set that was on a form of
lazy susan, so they anticipated a long process.  We had hoped they would 
arrive by 1:15 a.m. CDT or so.  They did arrive at 1:15 a.m., but it
was 1:15 a.m. CST [4].  They hung around until 3:30 a.m. or so.  I
think they had a good time.

The kids were good guests, so we did not have a lot of cleanup to do.
I think we made it to bed by 4:00 a.m. CST.  I guess that's 5:00 a.m.
CDT.  That's generally not a good time to go to bed.

I don't recall much of Sunday [5].  There's probably a good reason for that.
I got to bed early.  I got up at a reasonable hour this morning.  How will
I feel tomorrow?  We shall see.  But I don't think I'll again try this 
approach again.

[1] I like to pretend that the clock stays at 1 a.m. for an hour.
I know that's not the case, but it seems like an appropriate silly
approach.

[2] I don't remember where I read that [3].  And I know that you can't
believe everything you read.

[3] A quick Web search suggests that [there was an article in _The
New York Times_ a few years ago](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/03/06/daylight-saving-time-at-what-cost/the-economic-toll-of-daylight-saving-time) that quotes an estimate of $434 million annually.

[4] That is, an hour later.

[5] That's not quite true.  I recall breakfast with the family, cleaning out
a box of papers, some of which dated back to 2011, and watching an episode
or two of _Orphan Black_.  But I was not all that awake through any of those
activities.

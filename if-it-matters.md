If it really matters ...
========================

*Many of the issues in this essay will only make sense to Grinnell
faculty members (and, perhaps, faculty members at other institutions
and various kinds of Grinnellians).  I apologize.  But I think most of
you know that that's part of the territory.*

Michelle recently reflected on the number of things that I'm ranting
about and said something like "Just drop it.  If things really matter,
someone else will take up the issue."  That's really hard to do.

As I think I said in my essay on [mastering
Grinnell](mastering-grinnell.html), it sometimes seems like I know
(or remember) more about things than many other people.  So sometimes
I feel like I'm the only person who can raise some issues.

And I know that the things I bring up make a difference.  3-2 vs 2-3
leave policies.  Chairs meeting.

What are the things I'm worrying about the morning I sketched this essay?

* Old student handbooks.  No one cares about it right now, but someone
  will care in the future.  How did Grinnell's policies on X evolve?
  Sorry, we can't tell because we didn't bother to keep the student
  handbooks.
* Policies documents related to faculty evaluations.  Should worry 
  people more.  If practice doesn't meet the handbook, then people who are
  not recommended for retention or promotion have grounds to challenge.
* Policies on EOCEs.  (Didn't send any email.)
* Bookstore, as always.  (But I've promised to stop pushing on this issue.)
* Privacy violations with PCard data.  (I'm pretty sure that no one else
  who cares knows.)  (Explain?)
* Sabbatical policies.  (Don't make sense.  Don't match what we were
  told.  And I know that if I don't deal with it now, what's written
  will be treated as what we agreed to.  Will also impact me.)
* ???? - something else I was thinking about

Bleh.

"Let someone else take care of it."  It seems so easy to say.  But what
if everyone felt that way?

Surprisingly, when I sent followup notes on many of these issues, I
discovered that people had paid attention to my earlier comments.

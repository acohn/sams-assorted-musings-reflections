I recently celebrated [musing 1000](musing-1000).  However, as a
cmoputer scientist, I find musing 1024 equally important [1].  Just as
1000 is important to many people because it represents a transition
from three digits to four digits, 1024 is important because it 
represents a transition from ten bits to eleven bits.  

If a quarter is two bits, then ten bits is a buck and a quarter.  I'm
not sure what you call eleven bits.

Why do two bits make a quarter?  There's what I remember and what
is probably the truth.  Pieces of eight.  I always think of it as
being something like a Hershey bar; a dollar bill, as it were, but
easily segmentable.  But Middle Son says that they were scored
circular objects, coins you might say.  Let me check the Interweb.
It appears that Middle Son is correct.  Or maybe I heard it wrong,
maybe it's "pizzas of eight", since that's what they look like once
cut apart.

Where was I?  Oh, celebrating an anniversary.  It appears that I
am even less prepared to celebrate this anniversary than I was the
four-digit decimal anniversary.  I should have realilzed that it
was upcoming when I posted musing 1023 yesterday, but it didn't
strike me until I was about to post a very different musing 1024
tonight.  That one gets added to my "written, needs minor revisions"
list.

How should I celebrate?  I've been thinking about the history of 
another document about binary lately.  But that's a topic for another
musing.  I still haven't gathered together the sketches that never made
it to the sketchbook; I know that there are a bunch.  Let's see.

     $ ls *.md | grep -v index | wc -l
     1232

Yup, there are about 200 files sitting around that do not appear to have
been used.  I have some listed in my sketchbook, but not all of them.
I also moved some to a sketchbook folder.  How many are there?

    $ ls sketches/*.md | wc -l
    49

Another 50, more of less. I wonder if any are ones I'd want to revise.

Okay, a lot of those can probably be set aside.  Permanently.

Almost certainly anything with a "2017" in the title.  Some are
nearly finished musings, but no longer relevant.  Others are sketches.
The alum one appears to havve been notes from when an alum was back
on campus, including things they asked about (1010, Posse, Frisbee)
and a bit of a reflection on some changes in language.  I can get
rid of the older complaints about the amount of workload I impose
on myself, including the fourth in the "nibbled to death by ducks"
series, the ninth in the "inbox-zero" series, and the "taskcading"
that I had already moved.

Should I keep the musing on accumulation?  It seems to be one of many sets
of sketches on addiction and accumulation and my hoarder instinct.  That
seems like something I should keep.  The organization one, too.

It took me awhile to remember what "idgaff" is.  Then I realized
that it was an acronym for something I say to myself once in a
while, but never out loud.  I wonder what mood I was in that I
decided to eliminate it.

The sabbatical calculations one reeks of privilege, even though it's
mostly completed.  I'm dumping it [2].

Communications does not deserve the rant.  I'm pretty sure I sent
it to them for feedback before posting and realized that most of
my assumptions were wrong.  I appreciate those colleagues' willingness
to gently correct me.  Another one to dump.

Cool.  `commonplace-endings` was the start of my attempt to create a
commonplace book of endings in response to my complete inability to
find a way to end musings well.  It appears that I have a similar 
inability to keep commonplace books.  I'll keep it, just to be optimistic.

It appears that I was thinking a lot about term faculty.  Let's save 
those to look at again some other time.

Some of these are from last spring's hiatus, including one about the
hiatus that I got close to finishing, but never posted.  My, that was
clever of me.  I'm sad that I never finished the one on _Salt Marsh
Suite_.  It's no longer relevant, so I'm going to include the part that
I did write.

> This evening, eldest son said something like "Dad, you seem more relaxed
than you've been in some time."  In some ways he's right; although I have
way too many things on my plate right now, tonight I'm in a relatively
good place.  In part, it's simply a comparison to how I've been the past
few days.  But mostly, it's a response to having spent time immersing
myself in the arts, particularly in a multimedia dance piece in the
Flanagan entitled _Salt Marsh Suite_.

> [The missing parts that Sam never managed to write.]

> *THANK YOU* to the students who gave up so much of their time to provide
this wonderful piece to the broader community.  Thank you also for your
contributions to the wonderful choreography.

> *THANK YOU* to those who designed and built it.

> *THANK YOU* to the infrastructure at Grinnell that supported bringing the
piece to Grinnell.

> [Some final parts that Sam never manged to write.]

I should probably get back to making mix tapes for my kids.  I particularly
appreciate how I started the love/hate one:

> These are songs that I love that do not naturally fit in the genres of
music that my children like.  Hence, it's a love/hate mixtape.  I love
them; they'll likely hate them.

> 1. "Venus in Furs" by the Velvet Underground

> 1. "Los Angeles" by X

> 1. "That's When I Reach for My Revolver" by Mission of Burma

> 1. "Mary Tyler Moore Theme" by Husker Du

> 1. "Little Johnny Jewel (live)" by Television

> 1. "Piss Factory" by Patti Smith

> 1. "TV Eye" by the Stooges

> 1. "Blank Generation" by Richard Hell

Definitely songs I love.  Likely songs my kids will hate.  Definitely
a project worth revisiting [3].   But I have to remember where the
live TV is.  Perhaps _The Blow-Up_.

That's about all I have energy for right now.  I'm down to thirty
that I've kept.  That's not too bad.  Will I ever finish them?  Maybe
by musing 2048.

Was looking at musings a good way to celebrate this momentous event?
Possibly.  Perhaps I should have written software instead.  It seems
more appropriate.

**_Postscript_**: **Thank you**, once again, to Celeste Miller and her
awesome team.  _Sand Marsh Suite_ brought joy to my life and helped
me survive spring 2019.  I'm sorry that I was never able to pay tribute
to you in writing.

[1] If I'd been sensible enough to number my initial musing as musing 0,
I would have completed 1024 musings, rather than 1023, before the rollover.
However, as I've noted in the past, I was not expecting to continue this
habit for nearly this long.  There's also long-term evidence that "sensible"
is a term that rarely gets applied to the person typically referred to
as "SamR".

[2] More precisely, I'm moving it to a folder of musings I will never
post.

[3] We had a Marimba concert on campus tonight.  They were planning
to play some popular songs and, for some reason, my mind said
"In-a-gadda-da-vida".  I wonder if that fits into the love/hate
tape.  I'm not sure that I love it that much, and I'm not sure that
they'll hate it.  Time to move on.

Extra-credit policies and wellness
==================================

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), things I needed to write*

For most of my time at Grinnell, I've offered a modicum of extra credit
to students in my introductory courses [1] who attend or participate
in their classmates' activities, such as performances or competitions,
or who attend or participate in designated academic and artist events
on campus, such as [Scholars' Convocation](convocation) or the Public
Events series.  It's not a lot of extra credit: Eight events over the
semester earn students two points toward their final grade [2].

I don't recall all the reasons that I started offering extra credit.  In
part, it's because it gave an excuse to discuss these kinds of events
at the start of class.  In part, I knew that even a little bit of credit
is enough to incentivize students to do things they should do anyway. In
part, it acknowledges the extra time and effort that attending events
takes; given that we already expect [3] students to be spending at least
48 hours per week in class on their classwork and that many are working
ten or more hours per week, their time is precious.

I've found the policy to be successful, although it can use some tweaks
[4].  I regularly hear from students that they discover value from
attending these different events.  For some, it's the pleasure of learning
a bit about a sport they have not previously watched.  For others, it's
the experience of live music.  And for others, it's the intellectual
joy that comes from hearing a good talk.  I also know that for the
"peer support events", students appreciate being able to announce what
they are doing and to know that some of their peers find the time to support
them in what they do.

As I was reflecting on materials from a recent workshop on Academic
Success and Wellness, I was reminded of something that [Narren
Brown](narren-brown) once told me after observing my class for a semester:
Talking about these kinds of activities and encouraging students to
participate in them also helps build community and gives students
a greater connection to the institution.  Both outcomes can have an
important effect on student wellness.

The workshop made me realize that I should also explicitly add
"wellness" to the list of activities deserving of extra credit.  I do
offer credit for some wellness activities, such as going to the therapy
dogs study break.  However, those usually fall into the "Miscellaneous"
extra-credit category.  I see some value in making the importance of
wellness activities explicit, by listing it as a third core category,
rather than implicit.  While I'm not always fond of marketing, I do
understand the value of messaging.

Let's see ... what does my current policy say? 

> To encourage you to support your peers and be an active member of
the Grinnell community, I will award extra credit points for attending
certain events. 
You can earn extra credit for up to eight activities
(four academic and four peer support), each worth an additional 0.25%
on your final grade [5,6].

It shouldn't be too hard to update it to include wellness.  And, as long
as I'm updating it, I should also add some examples and write a bit
more about process [7].  Let's see what I can come with.

> To encourage you to take time for wellness, to support your peers,
to take advantage of campus opportunities, and to be an active member
of the Grinnell community, I will award extra credit for attending
or participating in certain events.  For example, you may earn extra
credit for attending meditation sessions at SHACS (wellness); for
attending your peers' athletic events and performances (peer support);
for attending Scholars' Convocation, the CS Departments' weekly CS Table,
and the College's Public Events series (academic and artistic events),
and for participating in College Town Halls (campus engagement).

> I will reserve a few minutes at the start of each class to announce
to allow students to announce their performances and competitions,
to describe events I suggest you attend, and to allow you to suggest
other possibilities.

> You can earn extra credit for up to eight activities (no more than
four in any one category: wellness, peer, academic/artistic, campus
engagement), each worth an additional 0.25% on your final grade.
To earn that extra credit, within three days of an event, you must send
me a paragraph in which you report on your reactions to the event.
You need not narrate the event; I care more about how it affects you
than about the details of the event.

That sounds good.  My students can expect to see this policy, or something
like it, when they next take four-credit courses from me.

[1] Most typically, CSC 151, CSC 161, and CSC 207.

[2] That's two points out of one-hundred.

[3] When I say that "we expect", I really mean that "[our policies require
that](https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/grinnell-workload)".

[4] For example, the policy is designed so that students spread out their
activities across the semester.  However, there are a few students who try
to cram all of the extra-credit work in at the end of the semester.

[6] That's less text than I'd remembered.  I guess I just add more in class
or in response to student questions in class.

[7] I'd swear that I'd written much of this somewhere else.  But I can't
find it.  So it belongs on my syllabus.

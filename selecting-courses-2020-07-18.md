In [a recent musing](tutorial-2020-07-16), I presented an introductory
letter to my students.  As a followup, I [provided my answers
to the set of fourteen-or-so questions](fourteen-questions-2020-07-17)
that students are expected to answer for their (not-yet-known)
advisors.  The last of those questions was to provide a list of
courses for the fall.

Once I started writing about the courses, I realized that my "'blogger
voice" had taken over [1]. It seemed best not to present them
directly to the students in an email message.   I'm also too lazy to
undertake a rewrite [2,3].

I wasn't sure whether I should pretend to be a first-year student
again or whether I should acknowledge the courses I've taken.  I
decided that no particular model worked.  I'm going to pretend that
the person I am now is going back to college, although perhaps with
fewer of my college classes completed.  I'm (mostly) sticking to
100-level classes.

Do you have access to a list of classes?  Did my advisees?  When I
drafted this and visited [my _de facto_ source for the list of
courses](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/), I
see that every course was listed as "Canceled", so I relied on
incomplete information.  Now it's updated, so I've updated a bit.

_14. List below several courses you are interested in taking during the first two Fall terms. The typical schedule for new students is 3 courses plus the First-Year Tutorial and the First Year Experience, across two terms (Fall 1 or Fall 2), for a total of 16+ credits. We encourage you to list at least 6 possible courses so that you and your adviser have a number of ideas to consider. Consult [Academic Planning for New Students](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/academic-advising/resources/new-student-planning) for suggestions on planning a well-balanced schedule._

* ANT-295-01, _ST: Jews, Multiculturalism, and Antisemitism_ (Fall
  1).  I have not explored enough of my Jewish identity.  College
  seems to be the place to do that.  Plus, I hear that Professor
  Gibel Mevorach is awesome.  (Yes, it's okay to take a course
  because you've heard great things about the professor.  You should
  also know that what is great for one person may not be great for
  another.) Whoops.  This isn't a 100-level class.  Oh well.  I'm
  still including it.
* ARH-160-01, _Introduction to Museum Studies_ (Fall 2).  I like museums.
  I'd like to find ways to think more broadly about them.  (How's
  that for a shallow rationale.)
* ART-134-01 or ART-134-02, _Drawing_ (Fall 1 or Fall 2).  Studio Art is a 
  potential major (or so I'm pretending).  I didn't have a chance
  to take it when I took art classes seven years ago.
* ART-195-01, _Introduction to Film Studies_ (Fall 2).  A starting point 
  for a possible independent major in film studies.

Hmmm ... Four courses, and I'm only through the A departments.  "At least
six" should not be hard.

* BIO-150, _Introduction to Biological Inquiry_ (Fall 1 or
  Fall 2).  Student Sam has heard that this course is one of the
  highlights of Grinnell's science program.  (Faculty member Sam
  has said so.)  Rather than a giant overview of the field, we get
  to "be" scientists, reading the literature, designing an experiment,
  conducting the experiment, presenting the results.  Sounds cool.
  I just want to be able to pick the one that sounds most interesting
  to me.  Plus, I hear that some sections will be offered in person
  [4].
* CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving_ (Fall 1 or Fall 2).
  Computer Science is a possible major, or so I'm pretending.  And
  I will be taking this course, at least in some interpretation,
  since I'm teaching it.
* ECN-111, _Introduction to Economics_ (Fall 1 or Fall 2).  I 
  have no desire to major in Economics.  But I feel like I should
  know something about it.  Maybe I'll put this off until another
  year.  Let's leave it as a fallback.
* ENG-121, _Introduction to Shakespeare_ (Fall 1 or Fall 2).  I 
  enjoyed my study of Shakespeare in high school.  I'd like to
  continue [5].
* GLS-195, _ST: Japanese Science Fiction_ (Fall 2).  I love science 
  fiction.  (Yeah, not the best reason, I know.) I'd look forward
  to the opportunity to study a different cultural approach.
* LIN-114, _Introduction to General Linguistics_ (Fall 2).  I'm
  interested in how language works and how languages form.  I know
  Grinnell does not have a linguistics major; perhaps this is a
  chance to consider an independent major.  Or perhaps I can combine
  this with my other potential independent major and do one on "The
  Language of Film" [6].  
* MAT-215, _Linear Algebra_ (Fall 1 or Fall 2).  I suppose I should 
  channel pre-college Sam and consider the course that I would have
  started with.  Plus, I expect every tutee to list at least one
  math class.
* PHI-111, _Introduction to Philosophy_ (Fall 2).  A liberal education 
  without philosophy seems woefully incomplete.
* POL-101, _Introduction to Political Science_ (Fall 1 or Fall 2).  I'd 
  love to have some background to understand what is happening in
  America (and the world) these days.
* PSY-113, _Introduction to Psychology_ (Fall 1 or Fall 2).  I
  should do a lab science.  Mom was a psychologist.  I should
  understand more of what she did.
* RUS-101, _Beginning Russian I_ (Fall 2).  Everyone should start 
  their career with a language (other than their native language).
  I'd like to learn one a bit different.
* STA-209, _Applied Statistics_ (Fall 1 or Fall 2).  It feels like 
  one needs to know statistics to understand the world today.  Also
  a potential part of my potential math major.
* THD-113, _Movement for the Performer_ (Fall 2).  I'll be honest.
  There's no way that college-age Sam would have listed this course.
  It's also not something that adult Sam would be comfortable taking.
  But I should have one course that's a bit risky, one that pushes
  me far outside my zone of comfort. 
* THD-115, _Theatrical Design and Technology_ (Fall 1).  My friends
  (okay, my kids) took a similar course elsewhere and said it's
  wonderful.

And I mustn't forget my two one-credit classes.

* MUS-120-16, _Perf: Banjo_.  I tell my students to take music lessons.
  I should take them, too.  Taking up a new instrument seems fun.  I
  would also consider others, perhaps trying a different one each
  semester.  I should consider Voice, but that might torture the poor
  instructor.
* PHE-100-25, _Beginning Tennis_.  Such a great sport.  Let's hope my
  knees can keep up.

How did I do?  I have at least six courses.  I have a language
course and a math course, as required.  I have listed courses in
multiple potential majors: Studio Art, CS, Mathematics, Film Studies,
and Linguistics.  I have the required music and wellness courses.

Yeah, I'm one of those students for whom the primary advising task
is narrowing choices.  But that's also good; if a course gets closed,
it's easy to find fallbacks.  So what would I suggest for myself?
(That is, what would Sam as an advisor suggest for the Sam who lists
too many courses?)  I might start by noting that some courses
are unlikely to be available; if I recall correctly, both sections
of Shakespeare were full after post-pre-registration.  There are
likely other full courses.  After we talked about that?
Ideally, we'd have more of a conversation.  This simulated
conversation is probably a bit more directive than I might do.

A\. Take a language in your first semester.  Plan to continue it in your
second semester.

> Done.  I'm taking Russian.

_B\. I recommend that you continue mathematics.  Since you said that 
Mathematics is a prospective major, take either MAT-215, _Linear
Algebra_, or STA-209, _Applied Statistics_.

> Statistics is valuable, but it's not Math [7].  I'll take it at some
point.  For now, I'd rather focus on making progress in the major.
Let's go with MAT-215.

_C\. Try something different than those two.  You could consider
divisional diversity and add a social studies course.  It doesn't
sound like economics or political science are prospective majors.
But you'll never know until you try.  Or would you rather explore
something different in other ways, such as _Drawing_ or _Philosophy_?
While both are in the same division as Russian, they are no closer
to Russian than they are to, say, Applied Statistics._

> Can I do ART-195-01, _ST: Intro to Film Studies_?  Didn't you say
  that we should try special topic courses because they might not be
  offered again?

_D\. Take music lessons.  They are included in your tuition.  They
give you a chance to explore your creative side._

> Banjo!

_E\. Take a wellness course, which most typically means a physical
education course.  I know it's trite, but a healthy body supports
a healthy mind._

> Beginning Tennis.

Great.  We'll cross our fingers that this all works out.  But I
should warn you that courses do fill at Grinnell.  That's a side
effect of having small classes.  There have been semesters in which
Linear Algebra is not open to first-years.  I expect the film
studies course will be popular.  Can we have fallbacks?

> Sure.  How do I indicate those?

We've now reached a difficult point in the simulated advising session.
If we had a traditional first semester, we'd discuss how to optimize the
first-year selection sheet.  That would include looking at current
enrollments.  But we're not doing a traditional first semester.  And
the faculty have not yet been told what first-year enrollment will look
like [8].  Maybe I'll learn in the Tutorial sessions next week.

Should I have told myself to take CSC 151?  It's an awesome course.
I'm not sure my Tutorial students should have to put up with two
courses with me, one in each term.  We'll have sections available
in spring [9].  If it were a high priority, I'd support the
decision.  I'd also warn them that it fills (and tell them that,
in my experience, any student who wants 151 in their first year
will get it in their first year).  So let's leave things as they are.

---

Speaking of spring, we might lay some groundwork for spring in this
discussion [10].

F\. Plan to continue Russian.

> Ok.

G\. You said CS was a prospective major.  If that's the case, you
should take CSC 151 in the spring.

> Ok.

H\. It would be good to explore another prospective major.

> Linguistics! [11]

I\. Let's plan to fill in the fourth course later.  I'd suggest
including one of the social studies courses during your first year.
Maybe political science, so that you can figure out what happened
in the election.  And who knows, you might discover a new passion.

> Ok. [12]

J\. You'll need a music course and a wellness course in the spring.
We'll also discuss those later---after you've had more time to
acclimate to Grinnell.

> Ok.

Course selections!  Explanations!  A mock advising session!  Mockery!
What else could you want?

Oh, I know.  Real people.  Real discussion.  I look forward to hearing
what my tutees are considering and to help them in their planning.
But I won't tell you about those conversations.  Sorry.

---

[1] Perhaps it had earlier, but it did not seem quite so pronounced.

[2] To be honest, I could not come up with a good way to rewrite
my list with an appropriate tone.

[3] To be honest, writing them this way feels more honest to who I am
or would be as a student.

[4] Should one trust hearsay?

[5] I failed to reflect sufficiently on that issue when I was an
undergraduate at Chicago.  "Shakespeare with Bevington" was one of
the most desired courses, one that students slept out to register
for.  I hung out with my friends who were sleeping out to get early
registration slots but never used my own for that course.  I did,
however, use my early registrations for film courses with Mast.

[6] While a "Language of Film" independent major would be fun, I
don't think one could successfully treat linguistics and film studies
as a combined major, at least not in that way.  I'm also not sure
how a film studies major and a language of film major differ.  On
the other hand, I know my awesome colleagues in linguistics and
dance have looked at the language of choreography together, so
perhaps something like this would be possible.  Now I'm even more
excited to be an undergraduate again.

[7] I was arrogantly snarky as a college student.  I should reproduce
at least a little of that attitude here.

[8] Does anyone know what first-year enrollment will look like, or is that
process still being designed?  I don't know.

[9] I'm not sure whether or not I'll be teaching one of those.

[10] I have that discussion planned for later in the term, but sometimes
it happens naturally as part of the discussion.

[11] Not an official major.  We'd need to have that conversation.

[12] It appears that I'm an agreeable student.

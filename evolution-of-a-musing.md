The evolution of a musing
=========================

You may be wondering what the process is that takes a musing from my 
muse, to my brain, to words on paper [1], and, finally, to you [2].
Let's consider, as an example, a recent musing on [bad software](...).

My muse planted the idea in my brain late last semester.  I kept saying
to myself "Boy, this new podium software is frustrating."  Eventually,
after enough times of saying that, one time this semester I grabbed a
note card and wrote something like the following [3].

> Bad software.  Gets worse.  Old version: Click "PC" -> Click "On" ->  Wait.
New version: Click "PC" -> Click "Yes" -> Click "OK" -> Wait -> Click "OK"
again.

But the podium software in our main classroom has lots of problems.  So
some of those problems accumulated in my brain along the way.  For example,
I got frustrated about resolution changes, a non-working "Mute Image" button,
screens that don't always come on, and more.  I also talked to the A/V staff
about it a bit.

At some point, the index card miraculously appeared in my pocket while I
was near my computer, and I added the following notes to myself in my
"proto-musing journal" [4].

>  Bad software.  Is it worse to use or to support?  Our projectors
New UI, even worse than the old UI.  Old: Click PC.  Click On.
New: Click PC.  Click "Yes".  Click "OK".  Wait.  Respond to new
modal dialog "Did the projector turn on?"  Stupid questions: Which
connection do you want to use?  (There is none.)  But here's the fun
part: I don't think AV chose the system and I think they even
discouraged the initial choice of using ...."

Then it sat in the journal for some time.  I don't date the entries, and
I don't check it in to GitHub often enough, so I can't be completely sure
how long it was there.  But it wasn't all that long.

So I wrote a draft.  And ...

[1] Or words on disk.

[2] It's also possible that you may *not* be wondering.    If so, you can
either read on or wait until the next musing.

[3] I'm not completely sure what I wrote, since I threw out the card.
And, even if I hadn't thrown out the card, everything except "Bad Software"
was scrawled on the card in my normal semi-legible "quick note" writing.  
But that quote is close.

[4] That is, my journal [5] of musings in prototype form, notes on musings,
and other things that help me muse.

[5] You may be thinking of a physical journal.  This one is electronic.
Really just a text file that I edit in `vi`, to be honest.

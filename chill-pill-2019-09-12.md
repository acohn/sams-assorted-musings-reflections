Finding my chill pill
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), [autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

Here's how I started tonight's musing.

> I'm on sabbatical.  I should be calm and happy.  My family even
tells me that I look more relaxed and less sleep-deprived than I've
been in a long time.  So why am I grumpy [1]?  It's a bunch of things.
I've spent nine months asking for the same corrections to the
handbook; it shouldn't be that hard to fix something so important.
I see that an overreach by the Dean's office in the review process
has been reinstated; I thought we'd dealt with that last year.  Way
too many aspects of the new computer policies upset me, from a lack
of shared governance, to insufficient notification, to a disregard
for the needs of term faculty; today I heard from an associate dean
that they don't intend to do anything about those issues.  Someone
has imposed new limits on practica credits in the Music department,
but not other departments; it strikes me that that kind of change
in policy should have been discussed by the whole faculty.  When I
visited the awesome new Disability Resource Space, I saw a poorly
designed office for support staff; we should treat our staff better
than that. [2]

> Many of these things others have also noticed.  But some seem to be
things that I'm the only one who notices.  Does that mean that no
one else cares?  I don't think so, but perhaps I am wrong.

I was intending to write a bit more, and then add something like
"I think I need a chill pill."

Instead, I went out for the evening.  I had intended to go to the
Writers@Grinnell reading, but I got the time wrong.  I left home a
bit before 7 pm; I discovered that it wasn't scheduled to start until
8 pm.  Since I had an hour to spare, I decided to watch the start
of tonight's volleyball match [3].  But I ended up enjoying the
match and talking to friends I hadn't had the chance to chat with
for some time.  It was an exciting match.  I did not follow the
lead of Justin Thomas at prior matches; stamping on the stands is
not my style.  Nonetheless, I cheered them on as best I could.  I'm
glad to be able to report that Grinnell won.

When I sat down to finish this musing, I realized that I was no longer
in the mood to rant.  It appears that I found my chill pill, at least
for tonight: Getting out of the house, watching an exciting match,
and talking to friends seems to have done the job.  I should remember
that the next time I'm upset.

What about all of those issues I mentioned.  They haven't gone away.
I'll probably rant about them in the future.  For now, I don't want
to damage my mood.  Check back another day.

Postscript: If you want more details on any of the issues I raised,
you can wait until I'm in the proper mood.  There's also a small
chance that I'd be willing to discuss them if you can track me down
in person.

[1] Or curmudgeonly.

[2] I had some other issues I intended to mention, but I can't
recall what they are.

[3] I sometimes find myself writing "volleyball game", but I'm pretty
sure that the appropriate term is "volleyball match".  I suppose I
also could have written "a set or two".

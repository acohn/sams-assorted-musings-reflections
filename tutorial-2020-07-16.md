_**This musing is in draft form.  Please do not read unless authorized to do so.**_

I received my list of new Tutorial students today.  I'm excited
to work with them.  From my first glance, it looks like I'll be working
with a great bunch of students with different interests.  Now it's time
to start composing a letter to them.

Dear Tutorial Students,

I'm Sam Rebelsky, your Tutorial instructor, and I'm writing to cover
some administrative details and to introduce myself.  As I hope you
know, we'll be using our Tutorial to consider what a liberal education
should look like in the twenty-first century while exploring
Grinnell's approach to liberal education.  We'll talk more about
the particulars later.  However, I will note that, if you are
amenable to the goal, we will try to put together a short anthology
on the topic as a product of our Tutorial.

From the little bit I've learned about you, I feel very fortunate
to have you twelve in my Tutorial.  However, I do not yet have your
information sheets and probably won't for about a week.  When I do,
I'll likely have questions for you.

As you likely know, the week of July 27--31 is New Student Advising
Week.  We will meet as a class, in small groups, and individually
to make your course plans for the fall and to get you registered.
It would help me if you sent me your available times that week
(Central Daylight Time, please).  

The first meeting, which I hope to have on Monday, July 27, will
give us a chance to meet each other.  We'll also go over registration,
discuss issues to consider as you start planning courses for your
first two terms, and go other issues of common interest.  On Tuesday
and Wednesday, we'll likely do small-group meetings to give you a
chance to discuss your prospective schedules with each other.  (Since
liberal education is a topic of our Tutorial, it's never too soon
to share perspectives and see how they affect your choice of courses.)
We'll follow those with individual meetings.  Along the way, I hope
that we'll have the opportunity to talk more about what you hope
to do during your time at Grinnell, to explore ways you learn well,
and to build a community.

Next week, I'll send you some more detailed plans for those meetings
along with some work for you to do in preparation for the meetings.

These meetings will, of course, be online.  When we meet online,
we will use Webex as our primary platform.  Webex is the video
conferencing software that Grinnell chose instead of Zoom.  We will
also use Microsoft Teams for individual and group chat and quick
calls.  Once the semester starts, I hope to be able to hold Tutorial
meetings in person, but that will depend on many still-to-be-determined
factors.

If there are accommodations I should plan to make to better support
you in these meetings, please let me know.  If you have a documented
disability, we should also begin working with Grinnell's Office of
Disability Services to make sure that we provide you with appropriate
support.  If you have a disability that is not yet documented, but
that you'd like to get documented, we can also discuss that with
Disability Services.  The folks there are awesome.

Since I'm about to learn a lot about you, I should share some things
about myself.  As I said, my name is Sam Rebelsky.  I sign things
SamR.  You should address me as Sam.  Please do not address me in
the generic.  (That is, don't write "Dear Professor".)  I identify
as an overweight adult heterosexual cisgender male.  I am culturally
Jewish; in today's climate, that makes it difficult for me to call
myself "white".  I use they/them/theirs as pronouns because I
believe they should be the standard.  If you are uncomfortable using
those pronouns for me, you can use he/him/his.  I've been married
for about thirty-three years and have three sons.  The oldest one
went to Grinnell, majoring in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Economics.
He also played football and swam.  He's now in graduate school in
Computer Science.  The middle one also went to Grinnell, majoring
in Music and Chemistry.  He dove (and swam), participated in a
variety of musical ensembles, and dabbled in student government.
He's heading off to graduate school in Chemistry.  My youngest son
is starting his second year in college (not at Grinnell).  

In addition to Tutorial, I primarily teach computer science but
also dabble in other areas.  I've been at Grinnell since the fall
of 1997.  I do research in a variety of areas, including computer
science education and the intersection of computing and the arts.
I took studio art courses during my sabbatical of seven years ago
and creative non-fiction writing during my sabbatical in spring
2020.  I like to read, write, and play board games.  I maintain a
'blog about life in academia.   I also like to make art, but don't
find enough time to do so.

Feel free to reach out to me via email with questions or comments.
I'll also be available in our Microsoft Teams Team once that gets
set up.  I will *not* communicate with you on Facebook (and you
should not communicate with me on Facebook).

In any case, I look forward to meeting with you, working with you,
and supporting you during the start of your Grinnell career.

Regards,

SamR

p.s. Since you have to answer fourteen questions for me, it seems
only fair that I answer the same fourteen questions for you.  I'll
admit that high school is a bit of a blur, so I'm going to substitute
college for high-school in my answers.  You can feel free to read
or ignore these comments.  They probably tell you too more than you
need to know.

*1\. Describe the type of <strike>high school</strike> college you attended and highlights of your academic experience there. What has been your favorite academic subject(s)? Why? What courses offered the most challenges?*

I attended the University of Chicago which, at the time, had a
moderate-sized liberal arts college (3,000 students) in the midst
of a large research university.  I loved (and still love) mathematics
and film.  Mathematics provides a venue for problem solving; I find
a sense of accomplishment when I work out a difficult mathematical
problem.  Film provided a venue for deep analysis, analysis that
combined visual, auditory, and textual (spoken or titled) elements.
Toward the end of my undergraduate career, I realized that I liked
CS.  CS has what I love about math along with the ability to build
things.

Although I got A's on essays in my high-school and local college
writing courses, I struggled with writing in my first year at UofC,
getting a bunch of C's.  I enjoyed most of the Physics I took, but
E&M didn't make sense to me, and it showed in my grade.  (Sleeping
through the midterm didn't help.)  I'd taken Latin and Spanish in
high school, so I tried learning a new language, German.  I did
okay but found it more challenging than I expected.

---

*2\. What do you most look forward to at Grinnell?*

When I arrived at Grinnell twenty-three years ago, I looked forward to
working with students who seemed to care about learning for the sake
of learning, to being at an institution that provided an excellent
education to students, regardless of their ability to pay, and to 
being at a place that cared about strong teaching and that supported
innovation in teaching.  

Those remain things that I love about Grinnell.  I've also found
that I value the size, including the variety of colleagues I know.

---

_3\. What do you feel are your academic strengths?_

I'm good at thinking outside the box.  That helps me come up with
approaches or solutions that others may not develop.  I don't always
realize that my solutions are atypical until I discuss them with
others.

I'm willing to take risks in my learning (and teaching).  I'm not
sure whether I'm more willing to risks now than I was when I entered
or left college, but it seems to be a characteristic now.

Before I got those initial writing grades, I would have said that I
was a good writer.  These days, after years of training, I say that
I spew reasonably readable text at a good rate.

I seem to be good at exploring patterns in numbers and in asking
questions about numeric data.

---

_4\. Which academic skills do you anticipate you will work hardest to improve in the coming year? (Check all that apply) [Mathematical skills; Study habits/time management; Writing skills; Verbal expression; Independent research; Library/Information skills; Digital skills/literacy; Other]_

Study habits and time management are a long-standing problem.  I
still need to work on those.  Saying "No" to additional tasks is a
related issue.

I did not know that writing skills were an issue upon entering
college, but they were definitely something I needed to work on.
I thought I was a much better writer.  Then I took creative nonfiction
this past fall.  Writing skills will always be something that I
need to work on.

Asking for help is also a skill I continue to need to work on.

---

_5\. Do you have any tentative ideas about what discipline you may major in and/or career-related goals? And please let me know why your interest is in these area(s)._

Entering college, I said "Math".  Going on to graduate school, I said "CS".
At times I wonder whether I should have said "Film Studies", but I wasn't
a good enough writer.  If I could go to college another time, I'd probably
try studio art.  At least that's what I did during one sabbatical.

---

_6. What do you hope to accomplish through your undergraduate education?_

Wow.  We ask you hard questions, don't we?  I went to college since it
seemed to be the thing you do after high school.  In the back of my head,
I always thought I'd be a professor, so I guess "Prepare me for graduate
school" might have been a good answer.

---

_7\. What activities (formal or informal) that you were involved with in 
<strike>high school</strike> college were most important to you, and why?_

I spent a lot of time in Doc Films, the student film group.  We showed
films every day.  I worked as a projectionist, shipper, and, for a summer,
as programmer/leader.  I don't know why I developed a passion for films
during college, but considering the various aspect of a film interested
me.  I also enjoyed the skill of seamless reel transitions when serving
as a projectionist.

I also became a vinyl addict in college.  I spent way too much time at
the local used record stores.  Finding a new great tune released some kind
of endorphins, as did finding a hard-to-find record.

I lived next door to a used book store.  Raiding the free pile that
appeared each day was one of my favorite activities.

I worked in the central users' site for many too many hours each week.
I enjoyed learning more about computing technology, reading newsgroups,
and helping others.

I worked as a teaching assistant for mathematics and computer science.
There's a great sense of accomplishment in helping someone else learn.

I also enjoyed spending time with friends.

---

_8\. Beyond your studies, what activities (formal or informal) do you hope to engage in at Grinnell? Why is that?_

I had no idea what I wanted to do beyond my classes when I got to
college.  I would not have predicted that I would study film, or collect
vinyl, or work as a computing assistant.  I might have predicted
that I would be a TA, although I seem to recall that I wasn't all
that good at first.  (My friends had some comment like "Sam figures
out the approach or solution, Randy explains it.")  I knew I'd end
up accumulating books; it's something I've done all my life.

Beyond teaching and raising a family, I did not have a good idea of
what I would do at Grinnell.  Activities I've enjoyed have included:
serving as Division Chair (I liked knowing how the sausage is made),
developing new classes (I guess that's part of the expectation), taking
classes, serving as coach of the middle-school MathCounts team and
wrangler for the middle-school Chess Club and Backgammon Club, running
a summer code camp, finding ways to bridge CS and studio art, helping
with the library book sort and book sale, and so much more.

---

_9\. What is your greatest concern about Grinnell? Or about the transition to college, in general?_

When I started college, I was worried about making friends.

When I came to Grinnell, I was worried about being in the middle of
nowhere.  I worried about the inability to browse bookstores, to visit
a variety of restaurants, to go to art museums.  I still worry a bit
about these things.  But the College museum is awesome, Des Moines
isn't that far away, and I seem to make more events on campus than I
did when I was in busier cities.

---

_10. Are you the first in your family to attend college?_

Nope.  Mom had a Ph.D. and her father attended college.  Dad did not
finish college and neither of his parents attended.  

I have close friends (and colleagues) who are the first in their
family to have attended college.  I also have close friends (and
colleagues) who represent multiple generations of college graduates.
I do my best to understand varied experiences.

---

_11. If you're comfortable, please tell me about your family, and describe the role they play in your education, if any._

My father died before I attended college.  I was an only child.  Mom
supported whatever I wanted to do, but didn't always seem to know what
I was interested in.  I seem to recall her talking about chemistry long
after I'd lost any interest I had in chemistry.  Although mom was a
professor, her experience of what higher education was like was much
different than mine.

---

_12. What language(s) do you speak? What language(s) are spoken in your home?_

I primarily speak English.  At various times, I also spoke a bit of Latin,
Spanish, and German.  I regret that I have not kept up those languages.

At home, we also speak variants of "nerd".  I participate most
actively in the CS-nerd, hacker-nerd, and linguistics-nerd
conversations.  I can usually keep up with the math-nerd conversations.
I stay out of the chemistry-nerd conversations.

---

_13. Share anything else you would like your adviser to know about
you: your passions, your identity, challenges you have faced in
your life,  or anything that will enhance the relationship that you
are beginning with this important mentor._

As I said, we seem to ask you hard questions.  I look forward to
seeing what you write.  You probably deserve some answers from me.

I should add a disclaimer, particularly since I did not write this
question: I will be your academic advisor.  I will do all that I
can to support you (or all that I can within reason).  I'll help
you develop an academic curriculum that not only serves your needs
but also challenges you.  I'll listen to you when you want to talk.
I'll advocate for you and work to cut red tape.  I will try to push
you in ways to be pushed.  To me, those are all part of advising.

But I don't think you can assign mentors.  A mentoring relationship
goes beyond those kinds of activities.  Mentoring relationships
take time to develop, and they don't always develop.  I hope that
I will develop mentoring relationships with many of my tutees;
history suggests that I will.  But history also suggests that you
will find your true mentors elsewhere.

What will enhance my advisor-advisee relationship with you?  I've
told you a bit about myself, both directly and indirectly, in the
preceding paragraphs.  Do you need to know more about me?  I suppose
sharing some things can help.  Some things are probably necessary.

As you will quickly discover, I am snarky.  I will make too many
cutting comments.  I'm doing my best to cut down on those comments,
but they seem to be ingrained into who I am.  Most students end up
appreciating that aspect of my personality.

I will appear disorganized to you.  And, in many ways, I am
disorganized.  But that's usually a symptom of the amount I do and
the amount I accumulate.  Michelle (my wife) says that I think more
about organization than most people.  These days, I tend to focus
my organization in a few small areas, which means that everything else
seems disorganized.

I went to a school whose undergraduate curriculum involved a lot
of requirements.  Grinnell's curriculum provides a strange contrast
to me.  What I regret most is that Grinnell students lack a common
intellectual heritage.  At Chicago, it was pretty clear that you,
your roommate, or your best friend had read Freud, Marx, Plato,
Adam Smith, and Thomas Kuhn.  (Yeah, a bunch of dead white guys.)
Being able to draw on a common set of knowledge deepened our
discussions, our arguments, our conversations.  I miss that.

Chicago was also on the quarter system.  That meant that most
students took between forty and forty-eight courses in their time
as undergraduates.  Most of you folks take thirty-two.  Grinnell
transcripts still seem slim to me.

Although Grinnell has an open curriculum (officially, an individually
advised curriculum), I believe that you should start your career
with some language (other than your native language), some math,
and some course that might be a major.  As you'll come to learn in
this Tutorial, I don't like treating liberal education as a checklist,
but I do expect you to be able to articulate a vision of liberal
education and to explain how the collection of courses you've chosen
support that vision.  I'll encourage you to take music lessons (free
at Grinnell) and a wellness course every term.  (I know for many
of you, playing music is a kind of wellness.  Something that gets
you exercising is also important.)  I'll also encourage you to
consider at least three majors in your first year and a half at
Grinnell; one of the great strengths of a place like Grinnell is
that you have time to discover a new passion early on.

I'm opinionated. You can probably tell that by now.

I tend to write too much.  You can probably tell that by now.  And
when I write too much, I sometimes "go off the rails", as it were.

I expect you to advocate for yourself.  If I'm giving what seems to be
too much homework, let me know.  If I'm not giving you the information
or support you need to succeed, let me know.  If I'm being too directive,
let me know.  (Or is that too directive?)

Oh, I also make a lot of jokes.  I think they get classified as
<strike>bad</strike> dad jokes.

I see that the new student planning document mentioned below suggests
that we describe disabilities.  My vision is going.  I may need to
peer closely at things.  My hearing is going.  I may ask you to
repeat yourself.  I am red-green color deficient.  Please do not
expect me to distinguish red and green or green and black in a
diagram.  There are also other issues I choose not to disclose.

---

_14. List below several courses you are interested in taking during the first two Fall terms. The typical schedule for new students is 3 courses plus the First-Year Tutorial and the First Year Experience, across two terms (Fall 1 and Fall 2), for a total of 16+ credits. We encourage you to list at least 6 possible courses so that you and your adviser have a number of ideas to consider. Consult [Academic Planning for New Students](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/academic-advising/resources/new-student-planning) for suggestions on planning a well-balanced schedule._

I decided it was not worth including the list in this
already too-long email message.  If you'd like to see my answers,

I received my list of new Tutorial students today.  I'm excited
to work with them.  From my first glance, it looks like I'll be working
with a great bunch of students with different interests.  Now it's time
to start composing a letter to them.

Dear Tutorial Students,

I'm Sam Rebelsky, your Tutorial instructor. I'm writing to cover
some initial administrative details, to introduce myself to you,
and to introduce you to each other.

As I hope you know, we'll be using our Tutorial to consider what a
liberal education should look like in the twenty-first century while
exploring Grinnell's approach to liberal education.  We'll talk
more about the particulars later.  However, I will note that, if
you are amenable to the goal, we will try to put together a short
anthology on the topic as a product of our Tutorial.

From the little bit I've learned about you, I feel very fortunate
to have you twelve in my Tutorial.  However, I do not yet have your
information sheets and probably won't for about a week.  When I do,
I'll likely have questions for you.

As you likely know, the week of July 27--31 is New Student Advising
Week.  We will meet as a class, in small groups, and individually
to make your course plans for the fall and to get you registered.
It would help me if you sent me your available times that week
(Central Daylight Time, please).  

The first meeting, which I hope to have on Monday, July 27, will
be for the full class and will give us a chance to meet each other.
We'll also go over registration, discuss issues to consider as you
start planning courses for your first two terms, and go other issues
of common interest.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, we'll likely do
small-group meetings to give you a chance to discuss your prospective
schedules with each other.  (Since liberal education is a topic of
our Tutorial, it's never too soon to share perspectives and see how
they affect your choice of courses.) We'll follow those with
individual meetings.  Along the way, I hope that we'll have the
opportunity to talk more about what you hope to do during your time
at Grinnell, to explore ways you learn well, and to build a community.

Next week, I'll send you some more detailed plans for those meetings
along with some work for you to do in preparation for the meetings.

These meetings will, of course, be online.  When we meet online,
we will use Webex as our primary platform.  Webex is the video
conferencing software that Grinnell chose instead of Zoom.  We will
also use Microsoft Teams for individual and group chat and quick
calls.  Once the semester starts, I hope to be able to hold Tutorial
meetings in person, but that will depend on many still-to-be-determined
factors.

If there are accommodations I should plan to make to better support
you in these meetings, please let me know.  If you have a documented
disability, we should also begin working with Grinnell's Office of
Disability Services to make sure that we provide you with appropriate
support.  If you have a disability that is not yet documented, but
that you'd like to get documented, we can also discuss that with
Disability Services.  The folks there are awesome.

Since I'm about to learn a lot about you, I should share some things
about myself.  As I said, my name is Sam Rebelsky.  I sign things
SamR.  You should address me as Sam.  Please do not address me in
the generic.  (That is, don't write "Dear Professor".)  I identify
as an overweight adult heterosexual cisgender male.  I am culturally
Jewish; in today's climate, that makes it difficult for me to call
myself "white", although I do have the privilege of appearing white
to most people.  I use they/them/theirs as pronouns because I believe
they should be the standard.  If you are uncomfortable using those
pronouns for me, you can use he/him/his.  I've been married for
about thirty-three years and have three sons.  The oldest one went
to Grinnell, majoring in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Economics.  He
also played football and swam.  He's now in graduate school in
Computer Science.  The middle one also went to Grinnell, majoring
in Music and Chemistry.  He dove (and swam), participated in a
variety of musical ensembles, and dabbled in student government.
He's heading off to graduate school in Chemistry.  My youngest son
is starting his second year in college (not at Grinnell).

In addition to Tutorial, I primarily teach computer science but
also dabble in other areas.  I've been at Grinnell since the fall
of 1997.  I do research in a variety of areas, including computer
science education and the intersection of computing and the arts.
I took studio art courses during my sabbatical of seven years ago
and creative non-fiction writing during my sabbatical in spring
2020.  I like to read, write, and play board games.  I maintain a
'blog about life in academia.   I also like to make art, but don't
find enough time to do so.

I know that you've been asked to complete a fourteen-question
survey for me.  I've written my own answers to that survey and
will distribute them to you when the College sends yours to me.
(Turnabout is fair play, or something like that.)

Feel free to reach out to me via email with questions or comments.
I'll also be available in our Microsoft Teams Team once that gets
set up.  My schedule is almost completely full next week, so I will
be unlikely to be able to participate in synchronous meetings then.
But I'm happy to communicate asynchronously.

In any case, I look forward to meeting with you, working with you,
learning with you, and supporting you during the start of your
Grinnell career.

Take care and be well,

SamR

p.s. I apologize for the overly long introductory message; as you
will discover, I tend to write a lot.

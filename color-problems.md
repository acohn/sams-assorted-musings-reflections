Color problems
==============

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), art*

Recently, someone pointed me to Emily Noyes Vanderpoel's 
_Color Problems: A Practical Manual for the Lay Student of Color_, an
old [1] book on color theory.  An incomplete scan is available on
[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/cu31924008632964).

One of the interesting aspects of the book are the analyses that
Vanderpoel does of different items, such as a butterfly wing [2] or s
rose-colored vase [3].  In these analyses, she appears to be breaking
up each item into its constituent colors and then looking at the percentage
of each.  For example, the rose-colored vase as 50% rose ground, 23%
white panel, 10% blue-green, 3% yellow-green, 7% yellow, 5% deep pink,
and 2% blue.  

She shows these in a ten-by-ten grid.  But I'm not sure how she arranges
them on the grid.  In the butterfly grid, she creates a column for each
color.  But in the vase grid, the pink wraps around the top and sides
with the white in the center and the other colors spread out at the boundary
between the white and the pink.

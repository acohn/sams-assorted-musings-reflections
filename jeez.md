An exclamation to avoid
=======================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), language, short*

I recently [wrote about language use](language-2018-05-02).  In that
musing, I forgot to mention a phrase that I keep asking students to
(re-)consider, "jeez".  Whenever I hear students say that, I tend to
respond, "Please don't take your Lord's name (or someone's Lord's name)
in vain."  After all, that seems to be the epitome of swearing [1] and [I
prefer that my students avoid using profanity in my classroom](profanity).

Whenever I say that students say, "It's just a word; it doesn't 
mean anything."  I find that a strange response; after all, aren't
words supposed to mean something?  They wouldn't hurt if they didn't.

Let's consider the word they use.  When I look in [Merriam-Webster
online](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jeez), I see that
its origin is as a "euphemism for Jesus".  And when I check the
[online OED](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/jeez) [2],
it says its origin is "1920s: abbreviation of Jesus."

In this case, it doesn't matter what you think you're saying, you are
using the name of someone many consider to be G-d in a non-prayerful way.
It may not bother you, but it's likely to bother someone.

Please find another exclamation.

Followup: [Friends suggested enough words of this form that I accept
defeat](jeez-followup).  I will not forbid my students from using
of "Jeez" (or Geez).

[1] Let's see ... when we use "swear" in this
way, we mean to use obscene or profane language.
[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/profane)
says that profane means "to treat (something sacred) with abuse,
irreverence, or contempt".

[2] "OED" is the way elitist or abbreviated people refer to the Oxford
English Dictionary [3].

[3] The OED also feels a bit elitist, but not the least bit abbreviated.
Even the abridged version is gigantic.

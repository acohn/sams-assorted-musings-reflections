Sitting in the waiting room at the hospital, day after day, unsure
if things will ever change.   Having an alarm go off fifteen minutes
before class, realizing that I've forgotten to prepare, or even
that I was teaching a class that day.  Missing my session at a
conference because I was out with friends and forgot I had
responsibilities.  Returning to the house on Billings park only to
find that it hasn't changed, except for an important absent presence.
A spinning body, high in the air, too close to a fiberglass board.
Looking down at myself during a major presentation and realizing
that I've forgotten to wear clothes.  These are the kinds of things
that haunt my dreams.

Two new candidates hope to join the list: Having to present my
writing in a Grinnell writing workshop and coping with my inability
to go beyond trite beginnings.

I put my writing before a public audience each day.  That should make
me a bit more confident in putting it before this class.  But I put
my musings before people to share thoughts, not to get comments on
my writing.  It feels very different to submit work for workshopping.

You'd also think that a workshop that I described as supportive
would not be intimidating or frightening.  But I know that my
creative writing needs work, particularly because I have trouble
with so many aspects of creative writing: metaphor, structure,
variation, ambiguity, more than I can hope to list.  While I know
I learn from criticisms, particularly the quality I expect from
this class, I worry about how many I'll get.

What does a writing assignment look like for this class?  Not like
I'd expected.  It goes something like this.

> Pick one of the model pieces that we've read in this genre or 
  subgenre.

> Identify some techniques the writer uses in that piece and assign
  yourself to use them in your piece.

> Write a five-to-six page piece.

The structure of the assignment reveals both simplicity and complexity.
We are mimicking parts of a professional piece of writing, but we
are not to mimic the overall piece.  Not so much chameleons as, um,
something else.  The twin tasks of identifying structural and
stylistic elements and then attempting to replicate them should
help us grow as writers, provided that those attempts do not appear
forced.

What pieces can I choose between?  That's more complicated than it
might seem.  We are reading and discussing a dozen or so travel/place
pieces.  However, we had only read and discussed three of them by
the time I started writing [2].  It seemed best to choose among those
three, or perhaps the set we were to talk about on the 11th.  What
did I choose?  Stay tuned for tomorrow's musing, when I write myself
an assignment.

I'm also finding it hard not to include a page or more of questions
along with my manuscript.  I have five potential titles.  Which do
you think is best?  Or do you have another suggestion?  What do you
see as the point of this piece?  I did not intend to link Zoe
Leonard's _I want a president_ to President Kington.  However, I
mention Kington twice in the piece.  Is it okay?  Have I gone
overboard in the paragraph that I've lifted from the psyche?  How
should I structure this group of sentences to achieve the right
rhythm?  I want to ask.

But I guess that's what the workshop and the class are for.  While
I won't get to ask questions in the workshop, except for one at the
end, I should trust my colleagues to raise appropriate criticisms.
More importantly, at some point, I need to be able to trust myself.
At the same time, I should acknowledge that writing is a collaborative
process; it's worth getting feedback from others.

I turned in my manuscript today.  I look forward to hearing from my
colleagues in class.  I just hope I remember to wear clothes.

**_Postscript_**: One potential advantage of writing for Ralph's
course is that it gives me subjects for multiple musings.  In fact,
that was supposed to be the topic of this piece.  As we've seen,
my writing strays.  But there's a good chance that you'll see a
musing about my assignment, the piece I wrote, some reflections on
writing the piece, some further reflections on editing the piece,
a summary of the experience of being workshopped, a summary of my
peers' comments [3], and a musing or two on writing issues [4].
At the end of the semester, you may see my rewrite, comments on the
steps involved in the rewrite, things like that.  Along with this
piece, that makes somewhere between eight and ten musings for one
short piece of nonfiction.  Not bad!

Let me know when you get bored.

**_Postscript_** I originally started this with my more typical "I'm
taking ENG-207.  Now I have to write my first assignment."  But my brain
wouldn't let me do that.  Is this new structure any better?  I'm not
sure.  I'm coming to feel that I've managed to replicate my standard
structure, albeit in a slightly different form.

[1] I mentioned it to them; they laughed.

[2] I was intimidated enough that I thought I should start writing on 
February 6.  I'm on my fourth draft.  I'm not sure you can tell.

[3] As long as that's okay with Ralph.

[4] I've already started one about sentence structures.

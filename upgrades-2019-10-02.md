The joy of upgrades
===================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), technology*

Yesterday, Grinnell upgraded its Exchange server to use two-factor
authentication with Duo [1].  That makes sense.  Schools [2] are
experiencing a huge uptake in phishing, and 2FA is an appropriate
response.

I thought I had prepared myself.  I've been using Duo for remote
login since the spring.  I checked [the list of supported
clients](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/its/ServiceCatalogPages/Multi%20Factor%20Authentication%20(MFA).aspx
[3]).  Both iOS mail and macOS mail seemed to be supported.  I'm
pretty sure that I even called over to ITS to re-verify, especially
since my colleagues were getting email messages that their clients
were not supported.  When Duo Mobile decided that my iPhone was too
old [4], I even got one of the key fobs.

Yesterday morning, I went to check my email on my iPhone.  I kept
getting an "Incorrect Password" message [5].  It took me a few
minutes to remember that yesterday was the rollout day for two-factor
authentication [6].  Instead of bothering the folks at ITS, I decided
to try dealing with the issue myself.  I found that removing my
Exchange account and re-adding it solved the problem [7].  Yay me! 

While I was doing that, I was reading email on my Mac.  The standard
Macintosh email client seemed to be working fine.  Or so I thought.
Then came the afternoon.  It, too, was now issuing error messages.
I considered the same approach.  However, I hate deleting my Grinnell
Exchange account from my Mac because it usually takes a day or two
to rebuild the mailbox.  So I called ITS to see if there was an
option other than "Delete the account and then add the account".
There wasn't.  So I deleted the account, and my Mac deleted all the
corresponding email from my hard drive [8].

Then I went to add the account back.  And, well, I couldn't.  I
kept getting authorization failures.  So I called ITS back.  And I
learned that Mail.app on macOS 10.12 (Sierra) does not support the
authorization framework that the College wants.  Hence, I needed
to upgrade to 10.14 (Mojave).  Whee!  I'd swear that information
wasn't on the page when I checked it a month or so ago.

I felt somewhat foolish upgrading to Mojave when Catalina is coming
out in a few weeks.  But I didn't really have any options [9].  And
I tend to be a late adopter, so I would not have been likely to upgrade
to Catalina immediately in any case [10].

I'm not sure why, but upgrading was a slow process.  Once I downloaded
and ran the installer [11], it indicated that installation would
take 4.5 hours, most of which seemed to be downloading the rest of
the OS.  Why so long?  It appears that my Internet connection is
slow, slow enough that I couldn't even run an Internet speed test.
I assume that the various email issues on campus are using up a
surprising amount of bandwidth.  At least I could pretend to do
other work while it was installing [12].

After an hour of watching the expected time increase, I reset my
Internet connection.  That made a huge difference.  When I restarted
the installer [14], the time remaining dropped from five hours to
fifteen minutes.  My download speed went from "unable to contact
server" to 50 Megabits per second.  Things were looking up.  And
then the damn connection reset itself.  When I reconnected, the
download speed was back down to 3.2 Mbps download.  In fact, the
Mojave installer couldn't even contact the installation server.
Have I mentioned how much I hate computers?  Anyway, it appears
that [it's a common
problem](https://www.iphonetopics.com/the-recovery-server-could-not-be-contacted-mojave/).
Fortunately, I didn't need to do any of those steps.  After trying three
times, I was able to connect.  But when I connected again, I was
back to a four-plus-hour download.

Eventually, I gave up and went home.  I looked through some of my
backup drives and found a Mojave installer.  I didn't expect it to
be for the most recent version of Mojave, but it struck me that
installing and upgrading would be faster than trying to install
over the Interweb.  Installing the OS still took about an hour.
The updates were 2.61 GB which, on my slow ISP, took a bit over an
hour to download.  Whee!  There were a few points where that time
went up, too.  But they were short.

I tried to do some other work while waiting for it to download the
upgrade.  One of the first things I discovered was that the Xcode
command-line tools that I rely on, like `git`, were no longer installed.
I didn't want to waste the extra bandwidth waiting for them to download,
so I had to figure out other tasks to undertake.  Bleh.

Once I got everything set up, I added my Grinnell Exchange account.
Then I realized that I needed to upgrade my [GPG
software](https://gpgtools.org/).  That worked reasonably well.  It
took a bit to find my verification code, which was buried in my
email.  But when I uploaded my keys to the server and tried to click
the verification links in email, verification failed.  Since verification
worked for my Gmail account, I blame Proofpointless for munging the
verification URL.

The experience of adding GPG tools to my mail client reminded me that
(a) I really can't use Exchange on the Mac, since it doesn't support
PGP and (b) I'll need to delay the upgrade to Catalina until those
tools are updated to support Catalina.

Somewhere in the middle there, my Web pages stopped working correctly.
I use UTF-8 for my page encoding.  For some reason, our server was 
reporting that may pages were encoded in ISO-8859.  I didn't think the
problem was associated with the email or OS upgrade, but you never
know.  I spent some time looking around to see if the default encoding
was set somewhere in the OS.  Eventually, I gave up and dropped a note
to our SysAdmin.  I got the answer this morning.  It appears that another
faculty member asked our SysAdmin to set ISO-8859 as the default
on Apache and that broke things.  The compromise of having no default
seems to have worked.

This morning, I was reminded of why I hate the strategy of "delete your
account and then add it again".  Even after a night of updating, my email
client says that there are 20K+ messages to download.  

Altogether, I lost about a day of sabbatical time.  Nonetheless, I'm glad 
that I'm on sabbatical.  If I'd been in the midst of classes, dealing with
lost work time and difficult-to-access email would have been unbearable.
I send sympathy to my colleagues and students who were in that situation.

I'm also someone who is (or should be) technically informed.  I expect
that this was even harder for folks who are less informed.  Or perhaps
they just passed the problems on to someone else.

I'd like to be able to blame someone for all of this.  But there's
not really anyone to blame.  I don't blame ITS.  As I noted, I know
that we need two-factor authentication.  And I'm not sure that
there's a better time to do an upgrade like this.  You need a time
in which people are on campus since fixing issues often requires
face-to-face contact.  The end of the semester is bad; people are
racing to finish too many things.  The beginning of the semester
is equally bad.  And they didn't want to delay too long.  So this
seems like an appropriate time to roll out DA.  And I know that
they made sure to have a large cadre of people available to help.
I don't blame myself.  I did the things that I was supposed to do
in advance.  I don't blame Apple for not having the appropriate
Microsoft authentication in macOS 10.12; I'm not sure what state
it had.  I don't blame Microsoft for a strange authentication system
[15]; their clients clearly wanted something like this.  Should ITS
have been aware of these likely problems?  It would have been nice.
But my sense is that the problems were not well documented.  The
one thing I really would have liked was an easily available self-help
page with easy-to-find and up-to-date information.  For example,
it took some time to remember that the instructions for configuring
email accounts on iPhones are in the student setup documentation,
and those instructions don't include the Duo issues.

Are there things that we can take away from all of this?  The experience
suggests that technology rarely works as easily as you expect.  But I'm
pretty sure that people knew that already.  That you need to explore a
wide range of situations?  That's also something I expect people know.
But situations are difficult to predict.  For example, you might find
that you can connect to the Duo-enhanced [16] server with iOS mail, but 
not realize that it only works if you did not have a prior account set
up on that server.  That people [17] should run up-to-date software?
There are certainly reasons to run older software, from concern about the
effects of upgrading [18] to an inability to upgrade because of hardware
limitations [19].

[1] And, perhaps, other services.

[2] Not just Grinnell.

[3] That document is behind a password wall.

[4] It's an iPhone 5S.  It's starting to get old enough that Duo doesn't
quite trust it.  That is, Duo reports that I need to upgrade to iOS 13.
However, iOS 13 doesn't run on the iPhone 5S.  12.4.1 is the currently
supported version.

[5] That message is paraphrased.

[6] Or maybe it was yesterday.

[7] Further conversations with ITS suggest that (a) I chose the appropriate
process and (b) the need to remove/reinstall the account is a known issue,
but Apple does not have it clearly documented.

[8] At least I think it did.  I suddenly had much more space available
on the hard drive.

[9] That's not quite true.  I could use Outlook for Mac.  That seems less
palatable to me than upgrading my OS.  Maybe I should give Outlook
a chance.  But not today.

[10] Sidecar seems to be an appealing technology, so I may upgrade more
quickly than normal.

[11] Or part of the installer.

[12] Writing this musing falls within that model.

[14] It quit when I disconnected from the Internet.

[15] Well, maybe a bit.

[16] sic.

[17] That is, me.

[18] As in this set of experiences.

[19] As in my iPhone.

A week of advising activities
=============================

Recently, I've been thinking, talking, and writing a lot [about
advising](advising-at-grinnell).  These considerations have been spurred,
in part, by the Dean's request for us to think about advising.  But there's
also been a Science Teaching and Learning Group [1] discussion of advising and
broader CS department discussions of advising.  Plus, as someone advising
a lot of students, it's always on my mind. 

I decided to record as many of the advising activities as I could recall
for a one-week period.  In this musing, I describe what I recorded.
I know that the musing is not complete, but it's about as close as I
can get it.  I think it's been a fairly typical week.  We have nearly
two weeks until preregistration starts, so there are a few planning
questions, but not more than normal [2].  It's after fall break, so I
think I've already covered most of the fall APR [3] issues.

The Dean has noted that he doesn't know as much as he should about advising
at Grinnell.  I wonder if this will be helpful to him.

Academic planning
-----------------

Conversations with advisee about relative value of concentration on top of
double major.

Review four-year plan for a likely advisee.  The plan is not perfect, 
but acceptable.  Send followup note suggesting some changes.

Review four-year plan for another likely advisee.  Not perfect, but
acceptable.

Suggest courses for next semester to a student who is unsure of what
might work.

Review declaration of major essay for prospective advisee.  Needs
rewriting.  Some grammatical issues and does not address the key
questions.

Review declaration of major for essay for another prospective advisee.
Get frustrated that someone decided that these essay should only be
100-200 words.  How can an essay can that short and address both the
scope of their liberal arts education *and* why they are declaring a second
major.

Review rewritten declaration essay.

Talk to an advisee about withdrawing from a class.  Confirm that it won't
interfere with progress toward graduation.  Try to convince student that 
it's worth staying in the class.

Talk to another advisee about withdrawing from a class.  Note that it
drops the student below twelve credits.  Talk to the student about
consequences.  Call Registrar's office.  Learn that there's a second
form to fill out.  Find the form and send a link to the student.

Discuss CS course choices for next semester with a prospective CS major.

Reflect on course choices and priorities with advisee.  Consider relative
benefits and conflicts of times.

Get signatures and carry declaration of major form to Registrar's office
for soon-to-be advisee studying abroad.

Quick chat in the hallway: "If I want to add a CS major, who should
I declare with given that you probably won't be taking more advisees?"  
Suggest they talk to the Chair as a starting point.  Suggest that they
talk to another student who is doing a similar double major.

Quick chat in the hallway with advisee about the importance of attending
classes.

Chat with double major advisese about courses for next semester [4].
Suggest some additional courses.  Discuss the value of music lessons.

"It is highly unlikely that I will allow a first-year student into CSC
321 next semester."

Career and post-graduation issues
---------------------------------

Review cover letter for internship with an advisee.  Suggest student also
talk to CLS advisor.

Talk to non-advisee about preparing for upcoming interview.  Put student in
touch with alumni who work at the company.

Talk to advisee about how to handle an offer deadline along with an offer
of an interview at another company after that deadline.  Suggest student
also work with CLS advisor.

Quick question: "Should I try to fit my résumé on one page?"  Quick answer:
"In most cases, yes.  Didn't you go to the Google talk?"

"Should I take a year off before graduate school?"  Discuss why.  Consider
options.

Non-advisee senior: How do I decide between these two very different
career options?  Discuss some of the characteristics of the two jobs.
Remind them that they are lucky to have two cool options.  Suggest that
teammates and learning are good things to think about.  Recommend that
they also work with CLS advisor.

Recommendation Letters
----------------------

Study abroad recommendation.  Approximately 800 words.

Realize that I need to find a place to store all of the 
[FERPA forms](http://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/FERPA%20Authorization%20for%20Reference%20or%20Recommendation.pdf).

Write a last-minute recommendation (about 600 words) for student who is
panicing that they have not heard from their recommender.  Discover that
the letter was submitted fifteen minutes after mine.

Other
-----

Discuss status of 3-2 plan with 3rd-year advisee.

Email another 3rd-year advisee to check on the status of their 3-2 plan.

Email faculty member to check on advisee who had been struggling.

Email another faculty member to check on advisee who had been struggling.

Update advisee list in preparation for preregistration.  I use that list
to keep track of who has and who has not registered for classes since
WebAdvisor/SelfService does not easily provide that information.  I also
need to keep track of who is currently abroad and who is going abroad.
And I got to mark one advisee as "graduating mid year" [5].

Follow up with faculty member about students in academic difficulty.

"The CSC 322 project from a few semesters ago that I've been working on
completing has become irrelevant.  What do I do?"  Start some simple
brainstorming (pick another CSC 322 project to finish).  Suggest that
we follow up with a meeting next week.

Follow up with another faculty member about student potentially in
academic difficulty.

Talk to first-year student not yet in CS who is thinking about a 3-2
program.  No, we don't offer a course in Python.  No, I don't have
recommendations of where to learn Python.  But I do have students who
might have recommendations.  The biggest proponent of Python in the
department is Prof. V.  Let's walk down the hall and see what she has
planned.  Oh, if the program also wants you to have Data Structures and
Algorithms, that's our CSC 207 course.  You'll need to take CSC 151 and
CSC 161 first, in that order.  Other students who are doing 3:2 programs?
Here are three.

Chat with a variety of students about the Facebook problem and some
related issues [6].

Catch student walking down hallway to see if they are feeling less 
stressed after break.

---

[1] STaLG.  Elaine M. and I coined the abbrev. back when we ran it.

[2] Some students really like to think ahead.

[3] Academic Progress Report.

[4] Since the student has two advisors, they want to make sure that they have
time to talk to both of us, in case they have changes that they need both
of us to approve.

[5] Congratulations!

[6] Some of the chatting was joking.  But we also talked about the more
serious issues of how students should treat each other and about broader
decision making.

A week of advising activities
=============================

Recently, I've been thinking, talking, and writing a lot [about
advising](advising-at-grinnell).  These considerations have been spurred,
in part, by the Dean's request for us to think about advising.  But there's
also been a Science Teaching and Learning Group [1] discussion of advising and
broader CS department discussions of advising.  Plus, as someone advising
a lot of students, it's always on my mind. 

I decided to record as many of the advising activities as I could recall
for a one-week period.  In this musing, I describe what I recorded.
I think it's a fairly typical week.  It's nearly two weeks until
preregistration starts, so there are a few planning questions, but
not more than normal.  It's after fall break, so I think I've already
covered most of the fall APR [2] issues.  I wonder if the Dean will find
this useful?

Academic planning
-----------------

Conversations with advisee about relative value of concentration on top of
double major.

Review four-year plan for a likely advisee.  The plan is not perfect, 
but acceptable.  Send followup note suggesting some changes.

Review four-year plan for another likely advisee.  Not perfect, but
acceptable.

Suggest courses for next semester to a student who is unsure of what
might work.

Review declaration of major essay for prospective advisee.
Needs rewriting.  Some grammatical issues and does not address the
key questions.

Review declaration of major for essay for another prospective advisee.
Get frustrated that someone decided that these essay should only be
100-200 words.  How can an essay can that short and address both the
scope of their liberal arts education *and* why they are declaring a second
major.

Review rewritten declaration essay.

Talk to an advisee about withdrawing from a class.  Confirm that it won't
interfere with progress toward graduation.  Try to convince student that 
it's worth staying in the class.

Talk to another advisee about withdrawing from a class.  Note that it
drops the student below twelve credits.  Talk to the student about
consequences.  Call Registrar's office.  Learn that there's a second
form to fill out.  Find the form and send a link to the student.

Discuss CS course choices for next semester with a prospective CS major.

Reflect on course choices and priorities with advisee.  Consider relative
benefits and conflicts of times.

Get signatures and carry declaration of major form to Registrar's office
for soon-to-be advisee studying abroad.

Quick chat in the hallway: "If I want to add a CS major, who should
I declare with given that you probably won't be taking more advisees?"  
Suggest they talk to the Chair as a starting point.  Suggest that they
talk to another student who is doing a similar double major.

Career and post-graduation issues
---------------------------------

Review cover letter for internship with an advisee.  Suggest student also
talk to CLS advisor.

Talk to non-advisee about preparing for upcoming interview.  Put student in
touch with alumni who work at the company.

Talk to advisee about how to handle an offer deadline along with an offer
of an interview at another company after that deadline.  Suggest student
also work with CLS advisor.

Quick question: "Should I try to fit my résumé on one page?"  Quick answer:
"In most cases, yes.  Didn't you go to the Google talk?"

"Should I take a year off before graduate school?"  Discuss why.  Consider
options.

Recommendation Letters
----------------------

Study abroad recommendation.  Approximately 800 words.

Realize that I need to find a place to store all of the damn FERPA forms.

Other
-----

Discuss status of 3-2 plan with 3rd-year student.

Email another 3rd-year student to check on the status of their 3-2 plan.

Email faculty member to check on advisee who had been struggling.

Email another faculty member to check on advisee who had been struggling.

Update advisee list in preparation for preregistration.  I use that list
to keep track of who has and who has not registered for classes since
WebAdvisor/SelfService does not easily provide that information.  I also
need to keep track of who is currently abroad and who is going abroad.
And I got to mark one advisee as "graduating mid year" [3].

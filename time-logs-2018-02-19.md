Logging my time (Week four of Spring Semester 2018)
===================================================

Continuing a pattern.

Two or three students who would like multiple appointments per week.

Side note: Someone asked _What are you using to keep the log? Is it something I could use too?_

I replied as follows.

> Um ... I use a text file and a command I type in terminal to cather data. For others, I'd suggest a spreadsheet. Or I bet the ProfHacker site has suggestions about good time logging software. The key is that you don't want it to add too much to your time. I do coarse-grained data, perhaps 10-20 entries per day.

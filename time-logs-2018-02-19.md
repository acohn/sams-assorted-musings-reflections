Logging my time (Week four of Spring Semester 2018)
===================================================

Continuing a pattern.

If we count musings, over 42 hours in the first three days of the week
alone.  But Thursday was better.  Only seven hours of work, including
musing.  Why?  Eldest was back in town, and I decided I should spend
time with him.  We also had a swim banquet for Youngest.  Friday I took
time to see Middle dive [n] and to attend the annual Grinnell Lecture [n].

[n] Also to see the other divers.  I'll miss seeing the SGA president's
dives, the cellist's awesome support of her teammates, and the other
senior diver with hair even wilder than Middle's.

[n] There have been three Grinnell lectures so far.  Each has come at
a point in the semester in which I could not keep my eyes open at 5:00
p.m. on a Friday night.

Two or three students who would like multiple appointments per week.

Side note: Someone asked _What are you using to keep the log? Is it something I could use too?_

I replied as follows.

> Um ... I use a text file and a command I type in terminal to cather data. For others, I'd suggest a spreadsheet. Or I bet the ProfHacker site has suggestions about good time logging software. The key is that you don't want it to add too much to your time. I do coarse-grained data, perhaps 10-20 entries per day.

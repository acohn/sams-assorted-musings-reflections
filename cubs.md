The end of the world is nigh [1,2]
==================================

---

[1] I mean "nigh" and not "night".  It means "near", but sounds
cooler.

[2] I seem to have answered the question: "Can you rationally have a
reference to an endnote [3] before the first paragraph?"  It appears the
answer is "Yes."  Our next question is: "Can you rationally have a
reference to an endnote before the first word in an essay?"  We will
explore that question in a future essay.

[3] I originally wrote "Can you rationally [4] have an endnote before the
first pagaraph?"  However, that's not a good question, since the endnote
appears at the end.  "a reference to an endnote" is more precise.

[4] Actually, I originally wrote "Can you have an endnote before the first
paragraph?"  However, the answer to that is obviously "Yes, although it
may not make any sense."

Yes, it's that time again, time for the long, rambly musing on
registration that bores most readers, including the writer, but
that one or two people have come to count on.  Or is it the
mid-registration musing that they count on?  I never remember.

I started writing these musings in part, to help me advise.  It's
good to know that the hot spots are and how they get resolved.  It's
probably still good for those reasons.  But I don't feel like I
remember to go back to them when advising.  Oh well, the knowledge
is probably hidden somewhere in my brain, if it's not disrupted by
knowledge of arcane pop tunes or something.

In any case, we have now finished preregistration, or early
registration, or preliminary registration, or just "registration",
whatever we've decided to call it right now.  I'm going to continue
calling it "preregistration" or "prereg" because I'm old and not
particularly good at accepting changes to language or names or
whatever.  But I'm going to think of "prereg" as shorthand for
"preliminary registration" since that's what the period is for.

This year's prereg period is different than most prereg periods for
the fall because we've allowed (asked?) students who are planning
to be abroad in the fall to also register for Grinnell classes.  After
all, we don't know what the fall will bring.  The extra 120 or
so students are likely to affect the number a bit; if I count right,
it's about a 10% increase in the number of returning students [1].

I traditionally write about Cuts, Closes, and Balances (CCB [2])
as part of this musing, but it feels a bit strange to do so this
year because the CCB process should be on hold right now.  After
all, it's a total waste of time to rearrange classes when so many
things are up in the air.  Will we be on campus or remote?  Will all
of these students be in Grinnell classes?  There's a (slim)
chance that some will be abroad.  There's a (not as slim) chance
that some will decide not to enroll in classes.  Will we be changing
the classes we offer because of other factors?  Why spend the immense
work that some departments or courses require when it's likely to
need redoing [5]?  So, I may mention CCB issues but they will likely
take less precedence.

Here goes.  All data are taken from my personal snapshot of
[the Fall 2020 list of course offerings](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/?Term=2020/FA) [8].

For a change, let's start with some of the most over-enrolled courses [9].
Do you want to guess what they are?

Let's start with some in the high teens.  My decision on where to start
was fairly arbitrary.  I suppose I could have put things in a spreadsheet
and then sorted, but that seemed like too much work.

* Section 4 of ART-111, _Introduction to the Studio_, is
  over-enrolled by 17 students, for a total of 32 students.  
  Fortunately, there are some slots for those students to move to, 
  six open slots in section 2, and five open slots in section 3.  Of
  course, section 1 is over-enrolled by ten students, so it's not
  all that easy.  But it's better than I've seen Studio Art look
  in years.  Of course, this may the first time they've been able
  to start with four sections of ART-111 and two of ART-134, _Drawing_.
* Section 1 of BIO-380, _Molecular Biology w/lab, is over-enrolled
  by 19 students, for a total of 31 students.  Molecular Biology always
  over-enrolls, but this seems worse than normal.  Almost all of the
  300-level Bio courses are at or near capacity, and one other is also
  over-enrolled by thirteen students: BIO-365, _Microbiology w/lab_. 
  I do not envy Bio the work of adjusting.

On to the twenties.

* Section 1 of PHY-132, _General Physics II w/lab_, is over-enrolled
  by twenty students, for a total enrollment of forty-four.  You
  might think to yourself "It's Physics.  Don't they just do a huge
  lecture?" No!  This section is the legendary *workshop physics*,
  one of the more extreme versions of active learning.  You think
  flipped classrooms are active?  Those at least involve some work
  before class.  In workshop physics, students learn through
  experimentation [10].  Or at least that's what I understand.  In any
  case, I'm surprised that Physics isn't offering two sections.  I
  hope another one is planned.
* CLS-258, _The Roman Empire_, is over-enrolled by twenty students,
  for a total of forty-five students, even though it meets at 8:00
  a.m.  Of course, it's an MC Cummins course, so this kind of
  enrollment is to be expected.  This semester feels like the first
  one in a long time for which I didn't need to advocate to MC to keep
  one of my advisees in her class.  Fortunately, MC seems to have had
  a good experience with my advisees (and my advisees have had great
  experiences in her courses).
* Section 2 of ENG-205, _The Craft of Fiction_, is also over-enrolled by twenty
  students, for a total of thirty-five.  It's predictable that CoF [11] 
  over-enrolls.  The question is how much.  Since English does not seem
  to be offering _The Craft of Poetry_, _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_,
  or even _The Craft of Argument_, I would have expected to see it ore
  over-enrolled.  On a separate note, I see that Garth Greenwell is
  teaching section 1 (also over-enrolled).  I enjoyed meeting him at
  the Writers at Grinnell session this spring and think students will
  be fortunate to learn from him.  How can English deal with the
  enrollments in CoF?  Perhaps with a fee [12].
* Section 4 of CHM-221, _Organic Chemistry I w/lab_, is over-enrolled
  by twenty-one students, for a total of forty-five students.  The
  other three sections balance out to having *one* open slot.  It
  seems like Chemistry must decide whether to somehow add a fifth
  section, have all four sections over-enroll by 20%, cut about 20%
  of the interested students, or, perhaps, wait until things settle
  down.  (Are you starting to understand my CCB concerns yet?)
  You'll also hear a bit about another of the OChem labs a bit later.
* The one section of CSC-301, _Analysis of Algorithms_ [14], is
  also over-enrolled by twenty-one students, for a total of forty-one
  students.  This situation represents another of my CCB concerns.
  Some of the students can probably take it in the spring, when we
  offer two sections of CSC 301.  But that means we have to figure
  out which ones can take another CS course and what that course
  would be.  I also wonder, over the long term, whether we might
  want to do two sections of 301 in the fall and two of 341 in the
  spring.  We need three of each per year, but student preference
  seems to be to take 301 in the fall [15].
* ECN-286, _Econometrics_, is over-enrolled by twenty-six students.
  It looks like 'metrics has the same model as CSC-301, one section
  in the fall and two in the spring.  So the department could probably
  boot some out and expect them to take it in the spring.  But who?
  Of course, it's Economics.  They probably have accurate models in
  place.
* SOC-235, _Mass Media and Society_, is over-enrolled by twenty-eight
  students, for a total of fifty.  There are usually a few SOC courses
  that are over-enrolled, but not often by that much.  If this were
  a normal year and I were in charge of the Sociology department,
  I might consider canceling one intro section, having that person
  teach SOC-291, _Methods of Empirical Investigation_, and begging
  Sharon Quinsaat to teach two sections of SOC-235.  Fortunately,
  neither of the preconditions for that suggestion hold.

On to the thirties.  Will there be classes over-enrolled by forty or
more students?  We shall see.

* Section 94 of MUS-120, _Performance: Voice_, is over-enrolled by thirty 
  students, for a total of fifty-two.  This case is one in which the
  over-enrollment is a bit fictitious.  These students are going to be
  distributed amongst a variety of voice teachers, and there should be
  enough room.
* You will not be surprised to hear that ENG-121, _Introduction 
  to Shakespeare_, is also over-enrolled by thirty students, for a 
  total enrollment of fifty.  I suppose it would be a bad idea for
  John Garrison to teach five sections of ENG-121 a year.  But I'm
  also pretty sure that they would all fill.  I wonder what English
  will do when CCB time rolls around.  Do they try to leave any
  slots for first-year students?  Do they drop any non-seniors [16]?
  Do we have to leave room for the Trustees who like to attend?
  Maybe if John required students to do a world tour of Shakespearean
  venues during fall break, he'd get enough to drop out of fear.
* SMS-195, _Introduction to Science, Medicine, and Technology Studies_,
  is over-enrolled by thirty-three students, for a total of fifty-eight
  students.  Congratulations to Michael Guenther and the rest of the
  new Short Message Service [17] concentration for a successful launch!
  Maybe the College will cough up the cash for Mike to teach an extra
  section [18,19].
* Section 3 of CHM-221L, _Organic Chemistry I Lab_, is over-enrolled
  by thirty-five students, for a total enrollment of
  55.  Fortunately, if students can be balanced between all
  six sections of CHM-221L, there is exactly enough room.  Fingers
  crossed!
* ENV/GDS-261, _Climate Change, Development, & the Environment_ is
  over-enrolled by thirty-six students, for a total of sixty students!
  I have no idea what you do about that.  Maybe you just keep the
  deniers and the Trump supporters, since they have the most to learn.
  I don't expect we'd have twenty-four in those two categories at
  Grinnell, but you never know.
* HIS-195, _Comparative Herbal Medicine_, is over-enrolled by 
  thirty-eight students, for a total enrollment of fifty students.
  It always seems like there's some Monday night course that gets
  over-enrolled, but I think this is a record.  Congratulations
  Carolyn Herbst Lewis!  (Or should I be expressing sympathy?)
  Hmmm ... it's only a half-semester course, so Carolyn could offer
  another half-semester version of it.  But all of her courses
  over-enroll, so where would the extra teaching come from?  And 
  that would still leave two more sections worth of students to cover.
  Is it time for Grinnell to add Wednesday night classes, too? [20]

Is there one in the forties?  Yes!  But I missed it the first time
I skimmed through the list [21].

* Section 2 of BIO-251, _Molecules, Cells, and Organisms w/Lab_ is
  over-enrolled by a whopping *forty* students, for a total enrollment
  of sixty-four [22].  Fortunately, there are thirty-six slots open
  in the other three sections.  However, It will be a lot of work for the
  Registrar's office staff to shift students around.  What happens if,
  say, we go online?  I'm pretty sure that some of the labs will become
  asynchronous.  So perhaps it's better to wait.  Why is this section
  the most over-enrolled? That's a difficult question.  It's not the
  instructor; all of them are listed as "staff".  Section 1 meets at 
  8:00 a.m. MWF, which is among the least popular times for students.
  Section 4 meets at 3:00 p.m. MWF, which is another challenger for
  the least popular time.  Section 3 has Friday afternoon labs, which may
  be even less popular.  I'm surprised they got thirteen students
  to sign up for that section.

What's left?  I don't feel like looking at individual departments.
I'm not sure any of you want to hear about them.  I make it a policy
not to comment on low-enrolled courses, other than to wonder, at
times, why some awesome topics seem to have such low enrollment.

Oh!  There's always space to comment on CS.  It is, after all, my
department and I have a responsibility to think about it, even if
I am not currently chair [23].  Let's see ...

* We have forty-one open slots in CSC-151, _Functional Problem
  Solving w/lab_.  That's about what we want.  We usually have to
  cut a bit to reach that point.  Maybe we have room because we finally 
  have the staffing to offer three sections each semester.  Or maybe
  people are scared of the regular expressions I've added to the course.
* The two sections of CSC-161, _Imperative Problem Solving w/lab_,
  are over-enrolled by five students.  I expect we'll allow all of
  those students to stay in the class, particularly since the
  over-enrollment is in Henry Walker's section [24].
* I'm happy to see that Computational linguistics has twenty-one 
  students.  That may be a new record.
* Section 1 of CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving, Data Structures,
  and Algorithms_ [25] has seven open slots.  Section 2 is over-enrolled
  by seven students.  Let's hope that the Registrar's office can balance
  the two sections.  That may be a CCB we can do now.
* CSC-208, _Discrete Structures_, has fifteen students with room for
  five more.  I'm interested to see that so many of our students are
  choosing the MAT 218, _Topics in Discrete Mathematics_, route.
* The two sections of CSC-211, _Computer Organization and Architecture
  w/lab_, have twelve open slots.  That's more than I expected.  That
  may be where we move some of the over-enrollment from _Algorithms_.
* I am confused that CSC-261, _Artificial Intelligence_, has fourteen
  open slots.  Are students not used to Tuesday-Thursday CS classes?
* I have twelve slots open in my one-credit CSC-281, _Learning from
  CS Alumni_.  Is that also a Thursday issue?  Is it that it's been
  so long since the course has been offered that students don't know
  its value?
* As I mentioned before, CSC-301, _Analysis of Algorithms_, is over-enrolled
  by twenty-one students.  We'll need to shift them somewhere, perhaps
  to CSC-211 or CSC-261, or to the other courses I describe later in this
  list.
* The two sections of CSC 324, _Software Design and Development w/Lab_ [26]
  are over-enrolled by nine students.  We also have two students enrolled
  in CSC 326, _Software Development Leadership w/Lab_.  I've forgotten 
  exactly how we expect to balance 324 and 326, which meet at the same
  time in the same classroom [27].  I think our goal was to have twenty 
  total, which is four five-person project groups.  If I count correctly,
  we just need to move three people from the morning section to either
  CSC-211, CSC-324, CSC-341, or CSC-395.
* Between the two sections of CSC-341, _Automata, Formal Languages,
  and Computational Complexity_, we have thirteen open slots.  That's
  enough that we need both sections, but it would be nice to have them
  more full.
* Seven people are enrolled in CSC-395, _Network and Matrix Computations_.
  That's a bit less than I'd like, but it seems appropriate for a 300-level
  special topics course with both CS and Math prerequisites.  From what
  I've heard, I think it will be a great class.

Hmmm.  This may be an easier semester to deal with than most.  We'll need
to swap some folks from 207 to 341 or 211 or whatever.  It will take a bit
to figure out who can be moved, but it may be less work than I expected.
At least we don't have the traditional "Who do we cut out of our 200-level
classes?" problem.

And there you have it.  I've reflected on registration.  I hope you 
are happy.

**_Postscript_**: Strangely enough, in the short window between
when I finished musing and when I planned to post, I received a new
message from Dean Harris.  It appears that we are going to continue
with the CCB process but will have an extra week to do so, until
May 8.  For reasons I described above, I think that's the wrong
decision.  CCB should not happen until after we've decided what the
fall model will be and made any of the necessary broader adjustments
for that semester.  But I'm not the one in power.

I feel particularly bad for my colleagues in the Registrar's office,
who will have to do much of the checking about which students can
switch, and for my colleagues in Biology, who appear to have the
most challenging cuts and balances to do.  

I wonder if some of those super-enrolled faculty (or their departments)
are going to try to negotiate for an extra course or two.

---

[1] Here's the back-of-the-envelope (or at the bottom of the screen)
calculation: We have a bit over 1700 students.  There are a bit
over 450 students in each entering class.  That leaves 1300 or so
2nd-year, 3rd-year, and senior students.  If 120 of those are
normally abroad, we would have 1180 on campus.  120 is about 10%
of 1180.

[2] Nope, not CCR [3] nor CCS [4].

[3] Creedence Clearwater Revival.  If you haven't heard of them,
you should listen.

[4] Purveyors of a nonessential ditty called "Tap Turns on the
Water".  It's just one of the many pieces of trivia that clutter
my brain.

[5] I'm still trying to parse yesterday's message from Dean Harris [6].

> **3) Reviewing Cut/Close/Balance Deadline *

> We are fielding comments from some colleagues about the
Cut/Close/Balance deadline and have created a sub-group of
representatives from the faculty, the Registrar’s Office and ITS
to examine current conditions and needs.

> **4) Next Academic Continuity Message**

> We will plan to communicate again on Thursday, April 30. The Academic
Continuity group will meet next as a whole group on Wednesday, April
29.

The [registration timeline](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/Registrar/Shared%20Documents/Fall%202020%20Registration%20Timeline-Accessible.pdf) [7] suggests that CCBs need to be done by May 1.  I don't know how the two dates relate.

[6] Since the message is available to the public at <https://instructionalcontinuity.sites.grinnell.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-23-Academic-Continuity-message-final.pdf>, I consider it reasonable to include the text here.

[7] Only available to readers with a GrinCo account.

[8] You may need to use a Grinnell account to access that page.

[9] Is that a change?  I can't tell.

[10] What happens if workshop physics moves online?

[11] Does anyone call it that?

[12] Did I need a content warning for the dad joke?

[14] We need to rename the course again.  The course is primarily about
the design and analysis of algorithms.  It may even be about the *literature*,
design, and analysis of algorithms.  

[15] As an advisor, I recommend that students take 301 in the fall
because it represents the subject matter that seems most relevant
to internship and job interviews.

[16] This is, after all, perhaps their last opportunity to take the
course.

[17] Science, Medicine, and Society.

[18] I apologize for the "cough up the cash" metaphor.  It may be
inappropriate for these times.

[19] Since Mike is in a shared contract (I think), the compensation
for an additional course should be about 1/5 of the five-course
shared contract salary.

[20] Sorry for the jokes, Carolyn.

[21] Maybe I should have put things in a spreadsheet.

[22] Will you still need me?  Will you still feed me?

[23] Since I'll be chair again this fall, I've started referring to
myself as the "Once and Future Chair".

[24] Henry is old-school.  He seems inclined to take as many students
as will fit in the classroom, even though it puts an extra burden
on him.  As a department, we've decided that reasonable caps (24
students) make sense for faculty wellness, particularly since most
CS classes are at capacity.

[25] I will admit that I consider the last two topics the core of the
course.  Students learn the basics of OOP (objects, encapsulation,
inheritance, parametric and subtype polymorphism), but I don't think
of that as all that is in modern object-oriented programming.

[26] Why is this Lab capitalized when the rest are not?

[27] We get no teaching credit for CSC 326.

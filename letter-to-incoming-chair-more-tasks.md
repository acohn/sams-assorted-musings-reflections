Additional responsibilities (part of a letter to the incoming chair)
====================================================================

_In [a series of musings](index-incoming-chair), I have been putting
together a variety of information for the incoming department chair
of CS.  Along the way, I listed a variety of department tasks and
responsibilities.  When I did so, I noted that I might forget some
things.  This document serves as the follow-up to list some more of
those missing things._

Introductory material
---------------------

As you'll be able to see in the material that follows, I do have some
issues with control, boundaries, and delegation.  But I've found that
if I'm not a control freak, things don't get done to the level I'd
like.

General responsibilities
------------------------

_Advocate for your faculty_

At times, external forces will try to impose themselves on the faculty in
the department.  For example, someone might ask an early career faculty
member to serve on a committee that is probably not worth his, her, or
zir time.  Students may press for independent studies in semesters in
which the faculty member already has too many commitments.  Part of your
responsibility as chair is to protect the faculty in these situations.

But advocating goes beyond that.  You should also note opportunities
and ....

_More mentoring issues_

I listed some mentoring roles.  You should also do your best to protect 
your faculty from themselves.  Henry and I were fond of taking on too
many commitments, from serving on extra committees to allowing our courses
to over-enroll.  You've been much better about protecting yourself.  You
should make sure that our other faculty protect themselves, too.  (And
you can try to get me to protect myself.)

_More budget issues_

The "Resources for Department Chairs" page at
<http://web.grinnell.edu/Dean/Chair/Resources_Department_Chairs.pdf>
suggests that "Most departments have a fund for academic speakers."
I don't believe that we do.  My guess is that it never got created when
we set up our department, and we should add it to our request when we
put in our next budget.

_Investigate complaints and moderate disagreements_

Yeah, they happen.  You can dump some on Chinyere, but you also have
some internal repsonsibilities.  (Story: Student complained to Lakesia
that they had heard that another student was being rude to their team mates.
That meant that I had to investigate.)

_Fundraising_

Mostly coordinating with DAR.

Department-specific responsibilities
------------------------------------

_Keeping track of accumulated credit_

Now that we have a variety of two-credit courses as well as lab-based
courses that accumulate 1.5 course teaching credit, some of us are
alternating years with 4.5 courses and years with 5.5 courses.

_Student groups_

I don't know why, but I forgot the Women in Computing group.

_Exit Interviews_

Make sure that they happen.

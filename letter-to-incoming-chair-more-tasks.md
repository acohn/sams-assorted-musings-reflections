Additional responsibilities (part of a letter to the incoming chair)
====================================================================

_In [a series of musings](index-incoming-chair), I have been putting
together a variety of information for the incoming department chair
of CS.  Along the way, I listed a variety of department tasks and
responsibilities.  When I did so, I noted that I might forget some
things.  This document serves as the follow-up to list some more of
those missing things._

General responsibilities
------------------------

_Advocate for your faculty_

At times, external forces will try to impose themselves on the faculty in
the department.  For example, someone might ask an early career faculty
member to serve on a committee that is probably not worth his, her, or
zir time.  Students may press for independent studies in semesters in
which the faculty member already has too many commitments.  Part of your
responsibility as chair is to protect the faculty in these situations.

But advocating goes beyond that.  You should also note opportunities
and ....

_More mentoring_

I listed some mentoring roles.  You should also do your best to protect 
your faculty from themselves.  Henry and I were fond of taking on too
many commitments, from serving on extra committees to allowing our courses
to over-enroll.  You've been much better about protecting yourself.  You
should make sure that our other faculty protect themselves, too.  (And
you can try to get me to protect myself.)

_Fundraising_

Mostly coordinating with DAR.

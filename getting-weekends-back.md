Getting my weekends back
========================

This coming fall, I will have a fellowship to work on a Digital Humanities
project at the Obermann center at the University of Iowa.  Many things
excite me about the fellowship.  I'll get to learn a lot about Digital
Humanities.  I'll get to interact with a new set of faculty and staff.
I'll have the opportunity to attend a variety of talks.  I'll be down
the street from Prairie Lights books [1].  I may even be able to sneak
away once in a while to hear a talk in computer science.  And, of course,
I get to work on a cool project [2].

But you know what excites me most?  I won't feel like I have to spend
my weekends catching up on grading or getting ahead on class prep [3].
I'll feel comfortable working on the house.  Or reading a book.  Or
working on a project (scholarly or otherwise).  Or just spending time
with family.  And I won't feel guilty that doing so puts me even further
behind.

Only nine months to go!

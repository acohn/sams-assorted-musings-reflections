The moat
========

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

Earlier this semester , I was speaking with a colleague about various
things on campus and they asked me if I knew why we had built a moat
around the new admissions building [1].  I admitted that I had not been
paying much attention to the landscaping at that building [2].  We made
some jokes about possible uses, such as defending the administrators
from a siege by angry faculty or students.  We also chatted a bit about
aquascaping that the likely difficulties raised by Iowa Winters?

But it got me wondering.  Why would we have a moat, or something that
looks like a moat, around a building?  And so I asked around.  Fortunately,
I have colleagues who pay more attention than I do.  I turns out that 
there's a very good reason to have a moat around admissions.  Here's
what I understood.

The new HSSC and the large amount of hard surface that they've installed
between the HSSC and Noyce will create a lot of water runoff in storms.
Rather than shove all of that water into Grinnell's already over-burdened
sewer system, the College decided to install a more environmentally
friendly system that allows the water to flow into the earth, with the
moat serving as the first holding spot.  In particular, I think the 
drains from the roof of the HSSC lead to the moat.

After a bit of searching, I did find the following note in [a page about
our campus landscaping](http://comm.sites.grinnell.edu/campus-landscaping-entry-and-wayfindingproject-overview/)

> Green Aspects of the Project: Using bioswales (depressions that collect storm water and send it back into the aquifer instead of into storm sewers), prairie-type native plantings that are sustainable in our climate. The master plan for the entire campus will encompass management of storm water runoff.

I'm glad that the College is thinking about such issues.  But I still
wish they'd let us do all the green aspects of Noyce that the faculty
had requested.

Postscript: While I was digging around for more details,
I ended up re-reading the [short overview of the HSSC
project](http://comm.sites.grinnell.edu/hssc-project-overview/).  If you
look at the page, you can see what I mean about the amounts of hardscape
between the two buildings.  You can also see the awkward noun-phrase
"non-fine arts humanities".  Is that really how it should be punctuated?
I'm still having trouble getting my mind around "non-fine".

[1] I call it "The Ski Chalet", but I don't think that title will stick.

[2] Given that I'm on leave this semester, I should certainly pay attention
to as little as possible on campus [3].

[3] I'm failing.

Counting Beans
==============

*A short story inspired by a followup conversation on [a recent
musing](course-tags-2017-09-09) [1].*

We should help students know what's in their dishes.  There's a study
that shows that bean consumption is good for you.  Let's label all the
dishes in the cafeteria with the kinds of beans that are in them.

_Helping students think about their nutritional choices seems like a
good idea.  But there are a lot of kinds of beans._

We'll focus on the major beans.  Let's see ... we'll use the ones we
ordered last week:  red beans, kidney beans, black beans, lentils,
pinto beans, navy beans, and fava beans.

_Did you really order fava beans?  That's awesome.  I really like them,
even though they can be dangerous [2].  But seven beans is a relatively
narrow spectrum.  what if we use another kind of equally nutritious bean?_

It's okay; we're just trying to encourage students to think about the
kinds of beans they consume.

_Can we at least add soybeans, given that we are in the middle of 
Iowa?_

Oooh!  Forgot about those.  I don't think of them as beans.  But that's
a great idea.  We'll add them.

[A few months pass.]

The North Central Bean Association is visiting campus!  They're going
to tour our cafeteria.  They've heard about our bean program and want to
see how beans are used in our dishes and whether students are consuming
a wide variety of beans.  We should make sure to mark all of our dishes.

_As far as I can recall, after having me spend a week making little
cards for each of our dishes, you never put them out for students or
their nutritionists to read._

We really wanted to put them out.  But, well, it's hard to modify the
signs next to the dishes; the sign company won't let us add space for
the bean lists.  

_So what now?_

The NCBA just wants some assurance that our students are eating the beans
we think they should.  Please make sure you list the beans in all dishes,
not just the ones you did before.  We'll just hand them that list and
our consumption information.

_We're serving hummus today.  Hummus is made from garbonzo beans [3], at
least when we make it.  Garbanzo beans are not on your list.  I'm not
going to label it as containing beans, or at least beans from the limited
list of beans you've told me I'm allowed to use._

If you won't label it, I will.  Let's see ... hummus is not traditionally
considered a 'murcan [4] dish, so we'll just use a non-'murcan bean.
I know, we'll label it as lentils and fava beans!

_Are you on some kind of hallucinogenic bean?  That's just wrong.
But, whatever.  What do you want me to do about the tomato soup?_

Can't you add beans?

_No.  Plain tomato soup is healthy on its own; adding beans would
compromise the taste and the intent.  We've also told students that
they should increase their tomato intake._

Okay, then we'll just label it as having red beans since it's red.

_Ah.  I finally understand what they mean when they refer to people as
"bean counters"._

Apologies to those heroic members of our faculty and administration who
have to provide data to the NCA. I know it is a difficult task.  And I
know that they are suspicious of our individually-advised [4] curriculum.
It is their insistence on numeric measures, rather than your attempt to
meet their requirements, that I attempt to critique in this musing.

[1] No, it was not with an administrator.  It was with a fellow faculty
member and it helped me to think about a process in a new light.

[2] Seriously. It appears that they can cause breakdown of red blood
cells in some people.  But I suppose many other foods are also dangerous,
allergies are a good example.

[3] Also known as chickpeas.

[4] American.

[5] Also open, no-requirements, and some terms that I've probably forgotten.

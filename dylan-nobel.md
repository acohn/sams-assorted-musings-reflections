Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize
=======================

When one of my readers wrote and said "Sam, will you write about Bob
Dylan's Nobel Prize?", I thought it was a joke.  First, there's no
evidence that I take [requests](do-you-take-requests.html) for essay
topics.  Second, when I think of the Nobel Prize, I either think of
the Science-oriented Nobel Prizes, or the Nobel Peace Prize.  And
so I assumed that the request was for a somewhat fanciful essay about
Dylan winning the Nobel Peace Prize.  Let's see ...

> From "Masters of War" and "Blowing in the Wind" to his modern ...,
Robert Zimmerman, aka Bob Dylan, has writen powerful and moving
pieces that have encouraged us to pursue peace, rather than war.  Has
he had an effect?  It's not clear.  There's certainly a whole lot of
war out there.  But it's not clear that any winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize has had that significant an effect.  Certainly, President Obama
jokes about winning it (or maybe gets forced to joke about wining it).
So it is not surprising that Dylan's moving lyrics have earned him
the peace prize.

But then I Googled it, and discovered that Dylan had won the Nobel
Prize in literature.

It's now a bit more than a week after the request.  I'll admit that I
haven't thought deeply about the issue, other than reading a few *NYTimes*
articles on the matter.  I see that the literati are up in arms ...

Of course, it's nothing new to treat popular forms as "real" art.
In the movement surrounding _Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma_, the French
embraced the study and value of popular American film, even B-grade films.
Many people refer to Jazz as "America's true art form".

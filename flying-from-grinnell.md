Flying from Grinnell
====================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinell), short*

Okay, it's not really possible to fly from
Grinnell.  There is an airport, named after a pioneering aviator,
but it's fairly small.  Normally, we fly out of Des Moines or
Cedar Rapids, each of which are an hour away.  Early this summer, we
were flying to LA.  Our choice was to fly out of Des Moines, do a long
layover, and get to LA about midnight, or to drive to Omaha (3 hours
instead of one hour) and do a direct flight that got us in about 5pm.
(Yes, we were leaving earlier in the day.)  The return trip was also
much faster.  Which do you think we chose?  There's a reason that
prospective students sometimes say that our location is a reason they
don't choose Grinnell.  (Of course, I'm pretty sure that Williams is
about as isolated.  Perhaps I'm wrong.)

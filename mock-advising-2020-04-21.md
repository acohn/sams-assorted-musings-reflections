Grinnell, like most schools, has been looking for ways to give
admitted and prospective students a better sense of Grinnell without
having them physically on campus.  I do not envy my colleagues in
Admissions that task.  I know all too well how you get a physical
impression of a place only by being there and that one of the primary
factors in choosing a school can be how comfortable you feel with
the people around you, the fellow admitted/prospective students,
the current students on campus, the faculty and staff, whoever.

In any case, one of the projects that our Admission office has
undertaken is to set up virtual/online advising sessions with a
faculty member and a few students.  As I understand it, the idea
is to give students a better sense of the close advising relationship
that should be one of the hallmarks of a Grinnell education.  In
writing to the students participating in my session, I called it a
"Mock Advising Session".

Now, I suppose that every one of my advising sessions might be called
a "Mock Advising Session" in that the odds are high that either (a)
I mock my student or their schedule [1], (b) the student mocks me or
my office [2], or (c) we mock the registration process or the software
associated with it [3].  But this is the other sense of "mock", as
in to "mimic", or what mockingbirds do [5].

Putting together my mock advising session has been an interesting
experience, not least because I'm relying on decade-old memories of my
most recent Tutorial [6].  But Tutorial advising, in my world, is
a multi-day process.  We begin with some discussion of the liberal
arts and some instructions for navigating the morass of information
available to students.  I then send them off with some assignments,
including not only readings but also requests that they talk to other
students about courses they would recommend (and why) and that they
read the descriptions of all special topics courses for the fall [7].

But that won't work for one fifty-minute, Webex-enabled, mock
advising session.  So I gave my mock advisees another set of
(optional) assignments.  Let me see.

* Read the College's Mission Statement and Statement of Core Values, available at  <https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=26&navoid=4402> [12].

* Read the College's statement about the Liberal Arts, available at <https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=26&navoid=4400> [14]. You can stop at "Why Pursue a Liberal Arts Education".

* Read William Cronon's "Only Connect", which provides a different perspective on Liberal Education. You can find it at <https://www.williamcronon.net/writing/cronon_only_connect.pdf>

* Look at [the schedule of courses](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/Registrar/Shared%20Documents/2020%20-%2021%20Schedule%20-%20PDF-Accessible.pdf) [15]---which is also available online at <https://webadv-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/WAPROD/WAPROD?type=P&pid=ST-X3WSEI>---and identify at least six courses that might be interesting to take in your first year at Grinnell.  You may need to visit the College catalog to see descriptions, <https://catalog.grinnell.edu/>. [16]

* Read through the descriptions of the special topics courses offered this year (marked as SPTOP in the schedule of courses, descriptions are then online) and find one that you think would be of interest to you or someone else.

* Find a 300-level course that might be of interest (e.g., in a prospective major) and trace the prerequisite chain.  (If that doesn't make sense to you, don't worry about it.)

Why do I have them do all this?  I believe that student's course
plans should be grounded in some perspective of liberal education
and its goals.  The first three bullet points help provide that
background.  The "make a list" is to give us something to start
with.  The special topics courses help give them a sense of the
range of courses.  The no-longer-included "ask around for a great
course" does the same; it helps me make the point that different
courses appeal to different people.  The 300-level course is not
only there to remind students that we have cool courses at the upper
levels, but to help them realize that there's often a series of
courses to take to get to the one you want.

That's probably too much, isn't it?  Oh well, I did say tell them
that it was all optional.  And it's easier to advise students who
have considered some background issues.  I hope it will be fun for
the students!

How will it go?  We shall see [17].

[1] "CS, Math, Econ, and Stats.  Don't you think you should take more than
one subject this semester?"

[2] "How old is that can of soda on your desk?  And when is the last
time you've been on the other side of your desk?  It looks like you
can only reach it with a shovel."

[3] Hmmm ... I don't see any Ellucian products on the [list of
approved software](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/its/SitePages/Approved%20Software.aspx).  I wonder if that means that I can't use WebAdvisor,
SelfService, and other software of their ilk [4].

[4] I checked in an advising session today.  They *are* approved.

[5] Ralph Savarese will note that my brain is now switching to a song
originally performed by Inez and Charlie Foxx.

[6] I'd prefer to teach Tutorial every three years.  It's amazing how many 
things have gotten in the way of what I keep thinking of as my next
Tutorial.

[7] Does that list still exist?  Nope.  But it's possible to replicate.
Go to our [Search Schedule of Courses page](https://webadv-prod.ec.grinnell.edu/WAPROD/WAPROD?type=P&pid=ST-X3WSEI).  Select the term.  Under "Course
Title Keyword(s)", enter "ST:".  That should give most of them.  Alternately,
you can select course levels of 100-level, 200-level, 300-level, and 400-level
and then select "Special Topics" from under "Course Type".  I mention the
latter approach because (a) its the approach that the Registrar's office
shared with me, which led to the one I suggested [8], and (b) it's
what you should do if you want the list of variable-topic courses [9,10].

[8] Without their message, I might not have figured it out.

[9] Can you believe there was a time that we made our courses
variable-topic, in part, so that students would see them on the
list of special- and variable-topic courses?

[10] It appears that there are more variable-topic courses than I expected.
I'll admit that I'm not sure why all of them are marked as variable-topic.
Perhaps that's a musing for another day [11].

[11] Yes, it is likely that tomorrow is that other day.

[12] I didn't point them to the [primary Web page about the Mission
Statement](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/at-a-glance/mission) because 
someone has added a set of guiding principles about Free Speech.  It's
not that I object to our free speech principles, but I don't think they
have the same status as the other two items on the page.  I'm pretty
sure it was never approved by the faculty.  I, for one, would have
objected to the "This" at the start of the fourth sentence, since
my editor taught me not to use "this" as a pronoun.

[14] Have I mentioned how much I hate URLs that look like that?  And
how much I worry that they will change each year?

[15] Why is the PDF of our schedule of courses only available on GrinCo?
I'm not sure.  I attached it.

[16] I assured them looking at courses is easier once you are enrolled
at Grinnell.  I think that's true.  Searching on WebAdvisor/SelfService
seems pretty straightforward, although I'm not sure how you find the
special topics courses.

[17] More precisely, my mock advisees and I will see.  I do not
plan to share the results of the mock session with my readers.

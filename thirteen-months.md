Eleven and one months of daily musings
=======================================

It's the end of the month [1].  I have achieved another milestone [2].
Since it's the end of the month, it's time to step back and reflect on
what I've learned from musing this month.  In the past month, I wrote
N musings.  Here are the titles of the musings, at least according to 
my notes.

> 
[Best of breed?](best-of-breed-etime)
[Game night](game-night-2017-08-02)
[A report from the Grinnell summer 2017 letterpress workshop](letterpress-2017-08-03)
[A report from the Summer 2017 CS Department Workshop](department-workshop-report-2017-08-07)
[A new CSC 151, revisited](new-csc151-2017-08-07)
[It seemed like a good idea at the time](it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-2017-08-08)
[Another unposted rant](unposted-2017-08-09)

So, what can I take from all of that?  I was clearly busy in August,
since there are at least four workshop reports included.  I may have
written too much in each of those reports.  While I didn't get to
many more of the ["overcommitted" and "nibbled to death by ducks"
series](index-overcommitted), I did experience the constant pressure of
having more tasks than I could reasonably handle.  That pressure led [4]
to a long streak of days in which I got no musings posted.  I made up
for it with a day of musings.

I spent the last week of the month trying to write shorter musings.
In doing so, I was reminded about the difficulty that I have writing
shorter musings.  Even for short musings, I find myself going off to the
Interweb or my filesystem to look for followup information, detouring
off on other topics, and more.  I do need to find ways to be more concise.

The being nicer musing.

[1] This month is August 2017, in case I forget in the future.

[2] Or perhaps millstone [3].

[3] Is the millstone around my neck or around my readers'?

[4] I know that some people write "lead", but I'm 99% sure that's
incorrect.

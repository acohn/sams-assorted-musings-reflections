Failing to muse
===============

Tonight was not a good night for writing.  

I thought about working on one of two rants, one
about Codecademy and one about [President Kington's
poorly phrased and overly defensive public comments on shared
governance](https://www.grinnell.edu/news/external/president-raynard-s-kington-discusses-culture-shared-governance).
However, at the end of the week, I don't have the mental energy for a
significant rant.  In the latter case, just posting Kington's words may
say as much as any rant I could [1,2].

I started two or three musings,  But I wasn't able to finish any of them.
I'm not even sure that I can finish this one.

I'll try again tomorrow.

[1] Here's what our Communications department posted.

> **President Raynard S. Kington discusses the culture of shared governance**

> Traditionally, [President] Kington said, shared governance on campus was based on a system of “relationships guiding interactions of shared governance toward a transactional model, where every single thing becomes [political] so it moves away from this relationship that every decision is put in the context of the whole and multiple decisions” together into a situation where everyone is trying to win at each turn and best everyone else to score points.

> “This is largely determined by culture, and culture’s a hard thing to change and to establish,” he said, adding that the current trend of “shortened tenures of presidents isn’t helping matters, because it takes years to develop these relationships.”

> Not only that, but in the culture of every man for himself and individual wins, “there is a tiny little slice of every single constituency that’s not going to be nice, that’s going to send you really mean emails and say really mean things,” and though they’re just a fraction of the overall stakeholder population as a whole, Kington said he’s “seen over and over how that handful can distort the whole convo and sort of recognize that often because, and this is a reflection of the world we live in, people feel authorized to say and do a number of things [via email or social media] that they’d never say to your face.”

[2] And yes, I do plan to say something "to his face".

On the wall of our bedroom, Michelle and I have two large photographs:
one of middle son and one of youngest son.  Both are amazing, and make
us smile every time we look at them.  The one of youngest son has him
caught in a moment of pure joy.  The one of middle son has him in one
of this contemplative but beautiful looks.  The two photographs are by
one of the most talented photographers we know [1], Jon Strymish.

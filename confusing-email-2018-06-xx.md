Getting confused by email
=========================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), email, short*

Once again, I've been having trouble with my "new" laptop [1] and needed
to switch to my old laptop.  That usually means waiting a bit for the
mail to update.  I never quite understand the order in which it loads
the new email.  It's not newest-to-oldest; it's not oldest-to-newest.

Because I use Mail.app on a Mac, I get notifications of "new" messages.
My general assumption is that those are messages that arrived when
they appear.  Certainly, the old ones don't seem to appear when Mail.app
is catching up after being off for some time.

While I was working during the update, a message from my chair popped up.
As a dutiful faculty member, I read it.  It was about the predicted
enrollments in spring.  We had asked every CS student to enter their
expected spring courses in WebAdvisor/SelfService [2].  The Registrar's
office can then run scripts to tally the data.

I think the message indicated that not every major had entered their
information and it encouraged us to chat with our advisees about some
of the pressure points for spring.

So I dutifully went through the schedules of the 39 CS advisees I currently
have [3].  Only two had not entered their spring 2019 courses and I could
figure out what those were.  I also noted some other things.  And I recorded
the info on all of the students in a text file so that I could find it
more easily next time [4].

Then I started to reply to the message.  It turns out that Mail.app misled
me.  It wasn't a new message from my chair.  It was an old message from my
chair, from a little more than a month ago.  I'm not sure why it appeared
on my screen.

I should pay better attention to the dates on messages.  Oh well, at least
I have notes on what CS courses my advisees plan to take in the spring.

[1] "new" means that I bought it used a year and a half ago.  I think it's
five years old now.

[2] Most of us refer to it as "WebAdvisor".  It's used for planning.
But when I talk to the folks in ITS who maintain the software,
they call it "SelfService".  And the URLs are all of the form
`https://selfservice.grinnell.edu/Student/Planning/Advisors/Advise/0123456`.

[3] 34 in the class of 2019; 5 in the class of 2020.

[4] For those who have not used SelfService, it takes about thirty seconds
to load a student record.  It also takes a long time to load the list of
advisees; I'm not sure how long because I got so fed up at waiting that I
found a way to bypass the list of advisees.

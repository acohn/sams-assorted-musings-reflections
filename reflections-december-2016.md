End-of-semester reflections, Fall 2016
======================================

*A few years ago, when the amazing [Karla Erickson](karla-erickson.html) 
began her term as Associate Dean, she decided that part of her role would
be improving our support for what she called "mid-career faculty", which
she identified as faculty anywhere between tenure and Senior-Faculty
Status.  One of the things she does is hold regular end-of-semester
reflection sessions in which she asks us to think about a variety
of prompts and then to talk about related issues.  Today's essay is
an extended version of my responses to her prompts at today's session.*


End of year and end of the semester.

Prompt 1: Make a list of at least three items of things of which you are proud this past year.  Does not have to be something that won an award.  Could be a conversation, etc.

* My children.  Remain awesome.  Probably becoming even more awesome.
* Predicting likely changes in demand for 207 and 208 and heading them off.
* Successful proposal to hire a new tenure-track faculty member.
* A few students who tell me that their conversations with me made a difference.
* Anita's "You are neither black nor female, but I come to you for advice."
* CS Reunion.  (Of course, there are flaws, but ....)
* Essays.  Make my life better.  Look to be a positive influence on other people.
* (Hmmm ... didn't write any particularly excellent code this year.  That's sad.)

Prompt 2: People who you supported in meaningful ways

* Michelle.  We support each other in many ways.  This has been a stressful year.  I could have done better.
* Lukas.  Served as a sounding board.
* Anna.  Helped think through load; continue to push her in new ways.
* John.  Advocated with college.
* Julia.  Just presence.
* Ursula.  Gave her confidence.

Prompt 3: Who meaningfully supported you?

* Michelle.  Helped me think through burnout issues.  And all the normal other stuff.  Keeps me going.
* Karla.  Helped me think through so many different issues.
* PM and Charlie.  Reminded me why I do this stuff.  Awesome colleagues.
* Mike.  With resources.

Buckets: Between now and the end of the semester.

Bucket 1: Recovery from this semester.  What do you need to do in the only 38 days (starting today)?  Try to be creative, and not just choose the things you would normally do.

* Back to daily exercise!!!!!!!!!
* Finish grading.
* Clean home office.
* Clean office and lab.  (Or perhaps just arrange for students to help clean office and lab.)
* Write code for fun.  Probably learning Rails well.
* Write "Don't Embarrass Me".
* Read.  Read lots.  Write about what I read.  (new challenge)
* Find time for art?  
* Computer Science Peer Educators Handbook (based on Jerod's stuff and other stuff).  Hmmm ... could this start as a sequence of essays of the day?  I don't have a lot of time left before the "Don't Embarrass Me" stuff starts, but I was planning to write this over break anyway.
* Make schedule for next semester that includes Ursula's class, Titus's class, office cleaning, and more.  Agh!
* Design a board game or games.  (The Yacht Race variant, the Fuzzies game).
* The workshop I signed up from.

Bucket 2: Projects for the next semester or year.

* Leftovers from up above.
* Personal
    * Support Michelle.
    * Weight loss.
    * Weekends off (Hah!)
    * Karla's idea of regular coffee with people.
* Creative
    * Essay of the day.
    * In November, maybe a NaNoWriMo.
* Department
    * Department infrastructure.  (Agh!)
    * MathLAN future.  (Not really my preferred project, but something I need to worry about.)
    * The new CSC 151.
    * HCI (maybe)
    * NSF grant proposals.
* Professional
    * Code camps, revisited.
    * SIGCAS member (?)

Bucket 3: Bright and shiny projects.  What things do you need to do to build some momentum?  Accountability?

* Weight.  I need to start to exercise again.  Think about time of day.  "Just do it!"
* Organization.  Schedule that includes straightening.  Maybe some policies.  Maybe sign up for employee assistance. 
* Essays and other writings.  I seem to be on top of these.  Writing some more software could be fun.  The peer educator's handbook could be a lot of fun.

Next: Apply prompts to projects.  What are you proud of?  Who helps/doesn't help.

* I'll be proud of weight and organization and they will help me support Michelle better.  
* Writing appears everywhere.  
* Amazingly, the essays also help with the people I support, as long as I write the right essays.  

Next: If I find another hour, how should I use it?

* Sleep.
* Exercise.
* Just chat with my family.  (Play games?)

Other stuff

* BIG ISSUE: Accountability.  I need someone to check in with me on things like the class and to make me do the work!  I need a personal assistant.
* Writing a letter to your projects ("Dear project.  I used to love you.  Now you just frustrate me.")

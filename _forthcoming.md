Some forthcoming essays

  There should be an
  almost never-ending supply of that kind of essay.  Title:
  "Things I plan to write about (Part of a continuing series.)"*

  of them.*

  topics.*
    * November: Grinnellians (mostly; I need NaNoWriMo somewhere?)

1. Megan Goering

1. Narren Brown

1. Harley McIlrath.

1. Candidate criteria

1. Following my muse.  (People ask me, "Sam, how do you decide what
to write about each day?"  Okay, I imagine that people ask me that.
But let's pretend.)

1. "Do you take requests?"

1. Bob Dylan wins Nobel prize.  (Mongo says "Rock n Roll. Form a band. Arts are important.  Students never know, one may win a Nobel for Rock n Roll!")

1. Mastering Grinnell.  (The other day, my Dean said something like "Huh.  I
hadn't realized that the bookstore was under the purview of the Instructional
Support Committee."  I'll admit that while I once knew that the ISC
was responsible for academic issues pertaining to the bookstore, I'd
forgotten.  Fortunately, I have a colleague who had recently reminded
me that "The ISC was created by merging the bookstore and library committee
and the academic computing committee".  I should have remembered that; it may
be the last time we eliminated a committee at Grinnell, and that was about
fifteen years ago.)

1. Family First (comment that "Family comes before students.")

1. Focusing on Failure (vs Celebrating Successes)

physician burnout.  For a long time, folks thought that a sense of 
accomplishment helped people cope with burnout.  It turns out that
that's not so true.)

1. Nibbled to death by ducks, episode 2.

1. Nibbled to death by ducks, episode 3 (the to-do list).

the US in the world.)

1. On being picky.  (On writing?  Rants?  Some followup to
Ralph Savarese's comment.)

1. On doing too much (or have I written that one already?  I probably haven't
written "Nibbled to death by ducks".  But it should probably wait for a day in 
which I really feel that way.) (It's in the overcommitment section)

1. On editing my own work.

Some forthcoming essays
=======================

Diversity in CS! (important issues)

SamR Recommends (aka Good Things at Grinnell)

Jeff Dickey-Chaisins (Grinnellians)

Righteous anger. (important issues)

Endnotes. (on writing)

Is it time to quit? (rants)

On being organized.  (On writing.)

Accessibility in Course Webs (online teaching)

On being picky about language.  (On writing?  Rants?  Some followup to
Ralph Savarese's comment.)

On doing too much (or have I written that one already?  I probably haven't
written "Nibbled to death by ducks".  But it should probably wait for a day in 
which I really feel that way.) (It's in the overcommitment section)

On editing my own work

On advising too many students (grad school, starting job, CS major,
what courses should I take? ... plus paperwork and more)

Should I link these essays?  (Make these essays more public.) 

Grinnell traditions I miss.

GrinCo, where we make you smile.

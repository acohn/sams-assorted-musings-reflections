Some forthcoming musings
========================

New "soon", normal length or possibly long.

1. Codecademy Ruby tutorial.  (I assign it; I think there are good reasons
   to use this kind of Tutorial; but, boy, there are many things I don't
   like.)  "Puts out every element inside the sub-arrays inside `s`."
   (This may have to wait until after students turn in the assignment,
   but I may want to write it earlier.)  `alphabetize` calls sort! (so it
   should be `alphabetize!`.  Mixes snake_style and camelCase for variables.
   Mixes puts and return strings.  (Dragon example. ...)
1. Schedule. `updating-course-schedule`.
1. Annotation software?: `sketches/annotating-the-web`.
1. Rubrics.
1. Advising assignment (for Joyce).
1. Detailed learning outcomes for CSC 151.
1. Teaching CS is teaching writing.
1. Don't embarrass me.  (Whatever happened to ...?  Will I ever teach
   it again.
1. Cleaning up musings?  (Somewhere between three and four dozen drafts
   of musings.  I'm not sure how many will see the light of day.  So a
   bit less than 10%.  Some I just deleted and will never remember.
   Others I moved to a separate folder to look at later.)
1. Grading Student Projects (See Janet's facebook post on Dec. 19, now at
   the end of this file).
1. Eboards. (`sketches/eboards.md`)
1. Outstanding / Excellent / Very Good / Average/Below Average.  Who
   puts average and below average together?  Who doesn't give approximate
   percentages?  Here's a better one: Top 1%, Next 4%, Next 5%, next 15%,
   next 25%, lowest 50%.  How long have you known the candidate?
   Less than 1 year / 1-2 years / 3-5 years / 6-10 years / more than
   ten years.  Truly exceptoinal (Top 1%), Outsstanding (96-99%),
   Superior (91-95%), Good (81-90%) Somewhat above average (71-80%),
   Average (51-70%), Below average (< 50%).
1. Customizing cover letters.  (I spend the few minutes to customize
   each recommendation letter.  Why do so many candidates fail to 
   customize their cover letter?  (No, we don't downgrade their 
   application for being generic.  But you can upgrade your own
   application by doing the homework.)
1. Social Media (and why I don't tend to use it except to announce musings).

New "soon", potentially short

1. Expanding list.  How many of these are new since I restarted?
1. Fall job interviews.  (Tapia + GHC + A third conference + interviews)
   A huge change.
1. Inbox zero.  Your Memories on Facebook recently came up with musing
   #189, "Inbox zero, stage 1."  `inbox-zero-01`.  Boy, was "inbox zero" 
   a failure.  Let's see ... as of today ....  WHy?  No system.  Mail
   comes in at an incredibly rapid rate.  Random spam because I have
   "popular" Web pages ("We've written this great resource on copyright;
   wouldn't you like to link it?") or because senders are incompetent
   (I've unsusbscribed from Democratic Party mailings at least a dozen
   times).  Too many professional emails (SIGCSE volunteers and SIGCSE
   listservs).
1. Every ten minutes.  (My new policy of standing up every ten minutes.
   I tend to get too focused.  ANy relation to Pomodoro?  I should look.)
   iPhone makes it nice.  But ten minutes always seems so quick.  And it's
   usually eleven, since I should walk for eleven.
1. Room and Board at Grinnell and elsewhere.  (See the `act-tuition-survey`
   musing for links.)
1. Forgetting musings.  (Example: Graders.  Was going to do the math,
   focusing on CSC 151, the course in which I most frequently use graders.
   My job is 50 hpw (some say 40; I've rarely been able to keep it
   under 60).  Should be about 50% teaching, 30% scholarship, 20% service.
   We teach the equivalent of five four-credit courses per year.  So about
   10 hours per week per course.  (there's also time on office hours,
   email questions, etc).  Let's see how that breaks down for CSC 151.
   Graders.  (I use student graders.  Discussion with colleague.
   List of things that I assign in CSC 151.)  4.5 hours in class.
   4.5 hours of prep.  Three lab writeups per week.  That would be six
   hours.  One quiz per week.  That's about two hours.  One assignment.
   6-8 hours.  Writing the quiz.  One hour.  Writing the assignment.
   Two hours.  Total: More than twenty hours.  Too much for one class.
   Old one: #202, `student-graders`.
1. My first big programmign project (`sketches/first-big-programming-project`)

Old "soon"

1. My first campus job(s).  (Too many!  Mentor for Math.  TC.  Mentor for
   CS.  When I hit more than 20 hpw, they told me that I had to quit.  But
   I volunteered instead.)
   <http://www.chronicle.com/article/What-I-Learned-From-My-Campus/241573>
   Learned community.  Learned teaching strategies.  Learned to be more
   careful about hacking the system.  That I like teaching.  That sleep
   is optional.  (Positives and negatives.)
1. Learning to advise.  (Did I write that already?)
1. "Can I have an extension?"  When to ask.  When not to ask.
1. "Things I wrote for other reasons".  Why am I labeling those when
   that's the initial reason I started this thing, whatever this thing is.
1. Makes no sense to me - Amount for student meals at conferences.
1. Whatever I do in 151 today - joy of tables?.
1. Five sentences.  (Slightly started.)

New forthcoming musings

1. My next Tutorial.
1. Overwhelmed by forthcoming musings?  (Many have been in the queue for
   more than a year.)
1. Implicit bias.  (What I know.  What I believe.  What the evidence 
   suggests.  Vs. Explicit bias.  Etc. Etc.)
1. Mentor vs. Sponsor
1. Blasters and Del-Lords (?)
1. Universal design: Don't rely on text in images in email messages.
1. Blasters and Del-Lords mixtape
1. Fun books: The 1924 College catalog
1. Losing the members of President's Council?  Effect on ability to search?
1. Sharepointless workflows.
1. Stopping sooner.  (Didn't need second section in local/national/global.
   Didn't need more than "I had criticisms.  I was mistaken."
1. Microagressions?
1. Curmudgeon or Cheerful - Both!
1. How to be a curmudgeon in N easy steps.
1. David Feldman. One of the more interesting pickups from this series.
 Imponderables - clearly an area for a liberal arts
 student. Got Michelle through med school. Continues to be diverse
 in intersts - bridge, music, Posse, more. I'm still not sure why
 he reads my musings each day.  (He did write his own autobiographical.)
1. Self-study - Institutional information. (Should Rietz be in the
 discussions of self studies?)
1. Sedona - Best of breed?
1. Curmudgeon - Letterpress "There's nothing in the world that can't
 be made a bit better by adding a curmdugeon. Except, maybe,
 ice cream."
1. Walrus series - Letterpress?
1. Why facebook doesn't provide context. (Followup to insufficient context.)
1. Evolution of CS department research labs. Old format: Tables for
 pair programming. New format: More open tables. TVs.
1. "Data People" and other people.
1. Tandy 102 vs. the Freewrite.
1. Business-size cards. (Buying too many. Then realizing their many uses.
 Codes of conduct in code camp. Random cards for CSC 151. Machine names
 (with directions) for CSC 151. And more!)
1. Islandwood and GOA.
1. Finish last Wednesday's mail piece. (Maybe never.)
1. Building the CSC 151 Web site.
1. Kate Walker - you only learn about people too late ....
1. "Did I miss anything?" (There's a poem by that name, How does it feel when a student asks that question, etc.)
1. Revisiting Tutorial. I'd forgotten that I'd written some of the things
 that I've done. Tutee birthdays. "Please Raynard, can't I teach Tutorial 
 again?"
1. Dates in musing URLs - why I do it
1. Building value for Grinnell (?)
1. BBC micro:bit
1. Norman Bins (vs. Norman doors)

A series on fun books?

1. CLC 17 - Contemporary Literary Criticism
1. Whatever book my Grandmother is holding in that picture?

All those outstanding anniversary musings (if it's not too late)

1. Favorites.
1. Longest
1. How much did I write?  (I can roll back.)
1. ...

A series on addiction and organization

1. Organization - No one who sees my office and laba may believe this,
 but I really like organization. Why aren't they neat? Addication
 to accumulation and inability to get rid of things. (`organization.md`)
1. Addication to accumulation. Might find the next thing that makes me
 really really happy. (`addiction.md`)

Old forthcoming musings

Quick (?)
---------

*For the days in which I need to "dash off" an essay in order to meet
my goals.*

1. Woody Guthrie: Ballad of Jesse James, Jesus Christ.  Not the order
I thought. I assumed that "Jesus Christ" was a classic melody and that
Guthrie modified it for Jesse James.  But it's the other way around.
(Probably doesn't help that I listen to Rum, Sodomy and the Lash way
too much. <http://www.pogues.com/Releases/Lyrics/LPs/RumSodomy/Jesse.html>)  
Perhaps call it "Getting it backwards?"

1. Notes to myself.  "What was I thinking?"

1. Facebook page edits.

1. Memorizing vs process; Google. (Pearl Before Swine, NYT quote of
Google, etc.)


1. "a musing" vs. "amusing"

1. Shop for Mom. (Related to mothers day.)

1. The csstudents mailing list.

1. "Checking in ..." A teaching tip. (and more)

1. Conference Swag.

1. (Semi-technical): Resetting passwords.

1. What is a Coaster

1. Academic geneaology. <http://veblenhouse.blogspot.com/2017/04/the-usefulness-of-useless-knowledge.html>. <http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2013/02/06/who-is-oswald-veblen-imagine-princeton-without-the-ias-einstein-herrontown-woods/>. <https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=805>. <http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/veblen_oswald.html>.

1. GrinnellParents listserv.

1. November 11th (in a year.)

1. Grinnell traditions I miss: You can do it

1. Grinnell traditions I love: Titular head

1. Grinnell traditions I miss: Addressing people

1. Grinnell trads: [Press]. Is press a tradition? Perhaps.

1. Fidgets? (Short?)

1. On names (Misc) (SamR, S.A., Sam, Samuel) [Short!]

1. Are these essays? (Should I rename them; I did?) Easy way out.
Google defines them as "a short piece of writing on a particular subject".
I think that fits. I just don't write enough argumentative essays.
(Does this one go in end-of-month?)

1. "relatable"

1. Misreadings: "Modern Python demands modern techniques" vs. "Monty
Python demands modern techniques". (There was the one about choosing
schools vs closing schools)

1. Lambert publishing. (See email from Anastasia Olaru dated 9 February
  2017.)

1. GrinCo, where we make you smile.

1. Should I link these essays? (Make these essays more public.)

General
-------

1. The list of topics that I've thought about writing about, in no particular
order, other than the ones I've come up with more recently tend to be near
the top.*

1. The old CSC 151.

1. LBRY.

1. Mindstorms.

1. CSC 322 summary?

1. CS department Outreach.

1. Scheduling grading time. I really need to have grading time as part
of my schedule, or I won't get it done. Should I start building Fall's
schedule now? Let's see ... for CSC 321, I need two hours per class period
for the reading journals and three hours per week for the homework. For
CSC 322, I should probably spend an hour per project per week reading 
through journals and code. Each class needs at least an hour prep. Oh,
this is going to be a fun fall!

1. More broadly: Putting together my schedule.

1. Reruns. (End of semester stuff, in particular: Week 14, last day of
class, etc.) (May wait until Spring 2018).

1. Treating your faculty with respect. (You should treat everyone with
respect. But you should understand the power dynamics in a classroom.
Don't do your homework for another class during class. If you have to
be late, send an apology. If you miss class, send an apology.)

1. Falling down the Racket accessibility rabbithole.

1. GSP, the Grinnell Science Project.

1. Something about the Chronicle article on a prof criticizing his 
students. http://www.chronicle.com/article/When-Do-Public-Rebukes-of/238552

1. Transitions (between paragraphs).

1. Missed opportunities (the book with mom)

1. Missed opportunties again (the Joe stories).

1. Balancing input and output. (How much should you read vs. how much
should you write?) (An issue for creativity.)

1. Outlook. (More precisely, Outlook Calendar.)

I seem to remember more than most people. Or maybe I just care more.

1. Code camp papers for SIGCSE. (About writing them? Oh, yeah, about
the weirdness of the papers getting the opposite responses that I
expected.)

1. Family First (comment that "Family comes before students.")

1. Becoming Deadwood. (As you may know, after many years at an institution,
some faculty become Deadwood. The myth is that they no longer care. I
think the reality is somewhat more complex. Dealing with frustration.)

1. Focusing on Failure (vs Celebrating Successes)

1. Being nice. (Flowers, flasks, maybe these essays, whatever)

1. Sleeping in. 

1. Creativity.

1. Algorithmic art . I am happiest when I write programs that make art,
or when I make art that has a computational component. In this essay,
I attempt to describe the relationship between these areas and the
pleasure I derive. (Or at least I think that's what I'll write about.)

1. Burnout. (One of Michelle's many roles has her exploring issues of
physician burnout. For a long time, folks thought that a sense of 
accomplishment helped people cope with burnout. It turns out that
that's not so true.)

1. On getting old. (New faculty, new music.)

1. Is it time to quit? (rants)

1. On being organized. (On writing.)

1. On being picky. (On writing? Rants? Some followup to
Ralph Savarese's comment.)

1. On doing too much (or have I written that one already? I probably haven't
written "Nibbled to death by ducks". But it should probably wait for a day in 
which I really feel that way.) (It's in the overcommitment section)

what courses should I take? ... plus paperwork and more)

1. Class mentors.

1. My mentors.

1. How Grinnell has changed in twenty years, revisited. (Hmmm ... maybe
I'm less upset than when I thought about revisiting this.)

site', revisited.) Adena's community comment.

1. Feeling fortunate, revisited.

1. Convocation, revisited. (Some others share my opinions. Others
do not. That's not surprising. I still think we should have weekly

---

Notes
-----

1. *Note: Try to have about one hundred forthcoming topics at all times,
 at least until I reach the three-hundred essays month.* (See below.)
1. *Note: When I have writer's block, I should pick ten of the topics
 above and write an essay about what I plan to write for those ten.
 There should be an almost never-ending supply of that kind of essay.
 Title: "Things I plan to write about (Part of a continuing series.)"*
  * The first time I did this, I think I only wrote three of the ten
   essays within the next two weeks.
1. *Note: At some point, I might consider top-ten lists. Maybe a month
 of them.*
1. *Thinking ahead: Alternate months of assorted topics and focused
 topics.*
  * April: Assorted
  * March: More Grinnellians 
  * May: Topics, revisited
  * June: Assorted
  * July: Maybe CSC 151 or CSC 321.
  * August: Assorted
  * September: Planning three-hundred more essays (I'd have to write one 
   set of ten topics each day; that could be an interesting challenge)
  * October: Assorted
  * November: The not-so-great, excessively end-noted, American novel.
   (A novel as a series of essays.)
  * December: Assorted
  * January: Preparing the next book?
  * Eventually: Top-ten lists (?)
  * Eventually: Autobiographical (?; probably not)

Facebook memories

Samuel Rebelsky
February 24, 2012 ·

Okay, I'm on leave from teaching. Why am I still finding that I have more work to do than I feel like I can physically do? (Some answers: I'm still doing lots of administrative work as department chair and a member of too many committees, the classes I'm taking take time, and thinking about studio art projects is really engaging.)

---

Note from Harly: Here's an honest question that sounds snarky no matter how I phrase it: why subscribe to something like Grammarly and put up with all its frustrations when you could just keep a style manual near your keyboard and pay attention to what you write?

Grading Student Projects

Janet: Why are student-defined projects so tedious to grade, despite giving students the opportunity to demonstrate their creativity? I think because they require real concentration to understand and careful judgment to assign grades to. Unlike homework assignments, there's not much benefit to grading them in batches because they have so little in common. The context switches get tiring. Next time I need to find a different way to approach this.

Jim Huggins: There's no opportunity for you to gain expertise in grading. This is what we see all the time in grading the APCSA exam. Most questions experience a speed-up in time required to score a given response as the week progresses, because readers gain experience with most of the common patterns of responses. (That assumes that a given question has only a few response patterns; when that doesn't happen, neither does the speedup.)

Susan Sanning: I've often thought it would be interesting to ask students to create a grading rubric for their self-defined project.

Janet Burge:  One of my colleagues has 20% of their project grade marked as "interestingness" and assigns it at the end. Then I can score the other deliverables using the same rubric (test coverage, use of tools, ...) and save the tough value judgements towards the end. Unless they want me to tell them in advance if what they did was interesting enough for full credit...

Patter Mattison Boothe: I was never able to find a homework grading rhythm, and preferred grading the student defined projects as a result.

I recommend taking an artist's view. Art professors grade student defined work constantly, and as such they trust their gut and sense of taste much more than most CS professionals are willing to do. Explicitly deciding to trust my sense of taste made grading custom projects a lot nicer.

Ellen Walker: Yes, but what is really frustrating is the need to justify your grades. I grade individualized student projects and I know going in what grade it deserves (using the "artists view") and then I have to make all the pieces add up right and the comments to justify it.

Janet Davis:  I have a hard time trusting my gut. I have a feeling this project will go one of two ways over time: Either I will figure out what I'm looking for and develop a detailed rubric grid, or I will go the other way altogether and grade only on the number of times students revise their work based on my feedback (great idea, Devon Wootten!)

Clif Kussmual:  I still struggle with this too. Some people me that they don't assign such projects because grading is too difficult or problematic - I feel my duty is to assign work that will most benefit the students, then figure out how best to grade it. I try to be up front about this with students and acknowledge that project grading tends to be more subjective than CS1 HW.
I try to use rubrics to clarify expectations for me & students, but sometimes I find that: a) the rubric and my instinct ("sense of taste") don't always match, and b) students try to game the rubric rather than work towards a good project. So I try to make the rubrics specific enough to clarify what I want, and vague enough that they can adapt to different projects, teams, etc.

Arielle Cooley:  I agree. Especially since we know that qualitative measures increase implicit bias, so for me it ends up being a little bit stressful and a lot of second-guessing (did I score this student too low because of a bias that I have? or too high because I am overcompensating for one I think I have?). Ack! The content is more interesting though.

Melissa Marks:  I've been experimenting with specifications grading - it does require that you know what you're generally looking for, but it results in a grading system where they did or didn't meet the minimum specifications for a basic passing grade (i.e. C). Higher grades can come from doing extra work or doing more sophisticated work (it's pretty easy to reward risk, interest, effort, etc. that goes beyond the minimum requirement without being more difficult or time consuming).

Codecademy Ruby Dragon Example, Step 14

<pre>
class Creature
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  
  def fight
    return "Punch to the chops!"
  end
end

# Add your code below!

class Dragon < Creature
  def fight
    puts "Instead of breathing fire..."
    super
  end
end

d = Dragon.new("Fred")
puts d.fight
</pre>

<blockquote>
    Add `puts "Instead of breathing fire..."` as the first line in our Dragon's fight method.
    Replace the return statement inside `Dragon`'s definition of fight with the keyword `super`. (No need to pass any arguments to super, since Creature's fight method doesn't take any.)

Some forthcoming musings
========================

REMINDER: April 20 is officially two years!  (Perhaps `second-anniversary`)

The next weekly log
-------------------

* Interaction with to-do list?  I'd mentioned that ...
* Getting back in habit after break of filling it out.
* A day nearly off.

The next end of month musing
----------------------------

* Start adding topics/tags at the top.
* Added Hypothes.is.  Broke things.
* Wrote a new introduction (?, I hope)
* Status of list of forthcoming musings (rearranged, I hope; changes to
  total number?  Added potential tags?)
* When I had to talk about CSC 321/22 recently, it was helpful to have
  spent some time writing about it.  I think it made me more articulate.
  (Of course, I also talk about CSC 321/22 a lot.  So perhaps not.)
* Tried planning a week in advance.  Quickly got disrupted.  Nights
  in which I needed short musings.  One or two musings that needed
  external approval (those are rare).
* Writing the long rant on [Getting requirements
  wrong](getting-requirements-wrong) ended up being a useful exercise.
  I explained to myself why I care about these issues.  I learned that we've
  explicitly exempted some majors from the department limit.  I began to
  think about the issue for Math/Stats.  Of course, when I started writing
  it, I thought it would be a short rant.
* Kept trying to write short musings.  But the short musings kept ending
  up being long musings.  Bleh.
* Partially for that reason, most musings still don't get posted until 
  10 p.m.  But I did get one out before 7:00 p.m. one day.  That's one
  that I just felt I needed to write.  (Which one was it?  Damn.  Oh,
  it was the mixed messages one.)
* Reached 600 musings.  Chose that number to try to restart a long-defunct
  series of "Grinnellians you should know (or know about)".  I remember
  why I wrote them.  They make me feel good.  I think they make other
  people feel good.  They shouldn't make anyone feel bad.  That's 
  definitely a net positive.
* Reached two years since the day I first mused.  If I had known then
  what I know now, there are so many things I would have done differently.
  Oh well, we live to learn, right?  (Or perhaps we learn to live.)

Musings with substantive drafts
-------------------------------

_I should finish these some time soon._

1. An introduction to SamR's Assorted Musings and Rants `intro-musings-v0.md`.

1. SIGCSE list workflows.  `sigcse-list-workflow`.  

1. Woody Guthrie Jesus Christ and Jesse James (`getting-it-backwards`)

1. Eboards. (`sketches/eboards.md`) (Less substantial than some of
   the others.)

1. Assessment. Two musings for the price of one?  Experience assessing
   courses.  Mistrusting assessment.  Split 'em.
   `assessment-revisited.md` "What's sad is that I really do believe in
   "closing the loop": Reflect on what you've seen in your classes.
   Think about what that means you should change.  Make the change.
   Consider the impact.  Repeat."  But you don't need formalized
   assessment practices for that loop.  You just need to pay attention,
   introspect, and discuss. (_Needs rewriting.  Should probably focus
   on just the mistrust issue._)

1. Losing weight.

1. Peoples' names. (`misnaming.md`)


---------------

### "High priority"

1. Allocating faculty lines.  (`expanding-the-faculty`)

1. Recycling update.

1. Unpacking quantitative literacy.  A group on campus has recently
   been upacking one of Grinnell's elements of the liberal arts [1]
   or perhaps another element.  So I've been thinking about doing the
   same thing with quantitative literacy.    It's really three kinds
   of literacy, which I'll term "mathematical literacy", "statistical
   literacy", and "algorithmic literacy".

1. Rural sports.  One thing that city and suburb folks may not know about
   being in a rural area is the challenges of being a supportive parent
   when your child is on a sports team.  While there are some similar
   size schools nearby ("nearby" = less than 45 minutes away), to get a
   full set of competitors, you look a bit further.  Let's take the other
   day, as an example.  Youngest Son had an away tennis meet.  I wasn't
   planning on going.  But Michelle really wanted to go and wasn't up
   to driving.  So we went.  It was in Boone.  Boone is about seventy-five
   miles / ninety minutes from Grinnell [1] Road construction.  And, well,
   there aren't that many tennis matches left in YS's high school career.
   So I drove Michelle.  We stopped for a quick (20-30 min) dinner on
   the way home.  All in all, it was six hours door to door.  On the
   positive side, I got a break from work.  On the negative, that meant
   that work stacked up.  But that's not the focus of this musing.  Rather,
   it's to note one way the experience of a rural parent is likely much
   different than the experience of an urban or suburban parent.  There
   are certainly a bunch of positives: living five minutes from work means
   less of a commute.  When the kids were younger, I could easily slip
   out of work to read in a class, or run MathCounts one day a week, or
   whatever.  And I love that the kids are not "tracked" into activities.
   All three boys did three sports, band, choir, theatre (usually tech
   theatre), and took College classes.  No one said "You're a band
   nerd; you can't play football."  No one said "You're a swimmer; you
   can't do a play."  Of course, because they do so many things, they
   are so many more opportunities to travel the not-insubstantial 
   distances to their events  But you know what?  I wouldn't trade it
   for anything.

1. Andrea Conner.  Things I appreciate.  How hard her job is.  Needing
   to build new relationships.  (I don't have the best relationship
   with student affairs.  I'm told that some student affairs staff are
   intimidated by my "crusades".  Andrea is a buffer; she may not like
   the crusades, but we have a long enough relationship that (a) she
   knows that my heart is in the right place and (b) she will call me 
   out appropriately if I behave in a way she thinks is inapropriate.)

1. Choosing the right word.  I was commenting on the current situation
   in CS.  (We still don't have as many tenure-line positions as we
   need, but we have hired some good visitors.  Someone said that they
   were surprised I wasn't more upset.  I wrote that I was relatively
   sanguine about the situation.  Then I looked up what I'd written.  Here's
   [a definition from Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=sanguine): "optimistic or positive, especially in an apparently bad or difficult situation".
   Yeah, that's about right.  I love it when my subconscious chooses the
   right word.  Too bad it doesn't tell me how to pronounce the word
   correctly. "sang gwen" not "sang wine")

1. Comments for seniors.  cs-seniors-2016

1. Logging my life?  (Maybe not this week; I'm not sure what's useful
   to say.)

1. The new CSC 151 assignment, option 1 (neural nets)

1. The new CSC 151 assignment, option 2 (text generation)

1. Report on the code camps

1. <https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-5-Types-of-Professors-/243108>

1. Vivek Venugopal

1. Advising complexities
   We have a new advising handbook.  I really appreciate the effort that
   went into what should be a "one stop shop" for academic advisers 
   (or advisors).  And there are lots of great things.  Nonetheless,
   as I read the handbook, I get reminded about frustrations as an
   advisor and as a computer scientist.  
   ...
   If the folks who are in charge can't get it right, how do they expect
   the rest of us to?
   Communication on campus.
   DRY.

1. Conflicting priorities
   This musing changed a lot during the months it sat in the queue.
   The original title was
   "Usurping the faculty's primary responsibility."
   The common reading.
   I don't object to the books.  But I strenuously object to non-faclty
   setting what seems to be the "common intellectual heritage" of Grinnell.
   At the same time, I understand that we need broader understanding
   of diversity on campus, and that the common read is an important way
   to make a difference ....

1. Double majors.  Something the faculty are discussing and should be
   discussing.  I support the availability of double majors, including
   double majors within a division.  Why?  We have small majors.  An
   eight-course/32 credit major may be as small as a minor at some other
   institutions.  [Insert normal disclaimer about hidden requirements.]
   And the idea of delving deep into more than one discipline can be
   a natural part of a liberal arts education.  I'd prefer that the
   disciplines be very different, but I'm certainly willing to listen
   to arguments about why disciplines that are in the same division
   are different.  Divisional classifications are arbitrary.  I'd say,
   for example, that Classics and Studio Art are no nearer to each other
   than, say, CS and Economics, even though Classics and Studio Art are
   in the same division and CS and Economics are in different divisions.
   I see some benefit to having double majors as a recruitment tools.
   ("Grinnell has compact majors, which allows you to delve deeply into
   two different disciplines.")  I don't see double majors as our primary
   obstacle to our students having a broad liberal arts education.  That
   said, I would certainly pair double majors with my proposed "Defend
   your liberal arts curriculum" approach, or anything else that encourages
   students to think more deeply about the goals and purposes of their
   liberal arts education and to demonstrate that they have achieved
   such an education.

1. Loading zone vs. parking.

1. Tagging the musings. Or does this just get incorporated into the
   next end-of-month musing?

1. Becoming a celebrity (before or after Scarlet and Give Back day).
   I'm still not sure why I was designated a celebrity.

1. Teaching CS is teaching writing.  Maybe use all the versions of
   `iota` that I recently covered in class.  (It's now less recent.)

1. Flying from Grinnell.  Okay, it's not really possible to fly from
   Grinnell.  There is an airport, named after a pioneering aviator,
   but it's fairly small.  Normally, we fly out of Des Moines or
   Cedar Rapids, each of which are an hour away.  Recently, we were
   flying to LA.  Our choice was to fly out of Des Moines, do a long
   layover, and get to LA about midnight, or to drive to Omaha (3 hours
   instead of one hour) and do a direct flight that got us in about 5pm.
   (Yes, we were leaving earlier in the day.)  The return trip was also
   much faster.  Which do you think we chose?  There's a reason that
   prospective students sometimes say that our location is a reason they
   don't choose Grinnell.  (Of course, I'm pretty sure that Williams is
   about as isolated.  Perhaps I'm wrong.)

1. Roles and Responsibilities.  (So that I know what I'll have to
   cut when I add my next role or responsibility.)

1. Favorite musings (or selected musings).

1. I love Grinnell.  (Reflections from meeting with Ologie.  I love our
   students.  I love my thoughtful colleagues.  I love the College's
   ability to support many of our students.  Whenever I get frustrated
   with the institution, I have to remember those things.)  [short]

1. To-do list managers.  (Notes are in my notebook.)  But also most of
   my tasks don't have a firm deadline.  When everything is in one
   place, I get frustrated realizing that I can't get everything done.
   Some days are intimidating when I make the list of what I really should
   do and then think about what I can do.  Take Friday (April 6), for example.
   I had constraints that put me in an 7:30-4 day (plus about 45 minutes
   at home beforehand reading through email, dealing with a few small
   tasks, and getting the to-do list set for the day).  Getting the quiz
   and class ready.  Teach class.  Office hours.  Meetings at 11:00
   and 11:30.  Noon meeting.  Hour "free" (class prep; review student
   journals).  Two hours of class.  Done.  What else did I have to do?
   Ideally ... write to recommendation letters.  Have a few necessary
   conversations with colleagues.  Deal with email (I'm never quite sure
   what that will be.)  Get ready for weekend work.  Respond to student
   exam prologues.  A bit of family stuff that needed to get done during
   the day.  During transition, missing some things that just don't make
   it to the to-do list.  Need to find time to reoranize.  Keep dumping
   things to the next day.  Model of "get it out of your mind" doesn't
   fit with my experience of how some complex things best get solved.
   Some things have to be in the subconscious - How will I best teach
   this topic?  How do I design this software?  How do things fit together
   in this research?  That's where insight comes from.

1. Preliminary planning for the new mediascheme version of CSC 151.
   `preliminary-planning-new-mediascheme-csc151.md`.

1. The value of things.  (The start of a new series on being a packrat.)
   Michelle and I argue about stuff.  A lot.
   Anyone who knows me knows that I accumulate.  I accumulate for a
   variety of reasons.  But one reason that I accumulate is that I
   assign meaning to things.  That Willa Cather book?  I bought it for
   my mother.  And, even though mom eventually learned enough about Cather's
   anti-semitism that she could no longer stomach reading Cather, I still
   think about the shelf of Willa Cather books on the landing at home and
   about the joy of finding a new one for her.  That Willa Cather book that
   mom never even owned, but wasn't in her collection?  Same thing.  The
   object ties me to my mother [1].  That old issue of _Scientific American_
   that I'll probably never read.  It's one of the huge collection that
   Salva Luria gave to me.  I kept one issue [2] to remember the gift.
   Next musing: But the number of things I accumulate, particularly things 
   that I accumulate for other reasons, means that the special things also 
   get lost.  And so I'm always reluctant to throw something away, because
   a special thing may be there, even if I'm not sure what the special
   thing is.  Michelle says "Take a picture".  But a picture is not the
   same as the item.
   [1] Amazingly, even thinking about that issue makes me cry.
   [2] Well, probably a half dozen issues.

1. Giving up meat.  I was talking to an alum and his family about [my
decision to give up sugar](processed-sugar) and my realization that I
don't miss sweets nearly as much as I thought I would.  After a month,
I don't really crave them.  His insightful sister suggested that if I
could do without sugar, perhaps I should consider doing without meat,
too.  That's a hard question.  But I did think to myself "should I try?"
This musing is my attempt to think through the issues.  I like meat (at
least I think I do).  And I really seem to do better with a high-protein
diet.  But I accept that there a variety of reasons not to eat meat, some
moral and some physical/health.  Moral: Equality of animals.  I accept
that we are biologically omnivores and that other creatues would eat us.
Treatment of animals.  Worries me more, but not enough.  Resource use.
Cutting my resource use is a good plan.  (One of sons notes that we
live in the breadbasket.  But cutting resource use is still good.)
Health.  Traditionally evidence that too much red meat is not good
for you.  Increased effects of vaccines and such.  Less would be good.
Increased cooking effort for protein.  Harder for me, since nuts are a
common source, and I'm allergic.  Deciding on limits.  Eggs?  Milk?  Fish?
Okay to deviate once in a while?  Nuts.

1. Bad classroom software, continued.  Carolyn's  quote
   "I would say that the first version of the software-based system significantly changed my experience teaching with technology for the better. In the classrooms I taught in, it made the technology more reliable and the experience of doing what I wanted to do more uniform across classrooms. // My experience this semester has been rocky, but it's hard for me to isolate whether the source of my problems is the software or the hardware. At the same time the software was updated I also started teaching in two completely new classrooms for me--one set up for art (no PC, two screens) and one for music (which seems to have more audio inputs to choose from, in addition to the new options you are writing about with the updated software). So this semester has been a little frustrating, but I've usually been able to get things working, other than the first day when I realized I didn't have a PC available and so couldn't get to the teaching files I have on my H: drive. The mute screen buttons have worked, the coloring of the projection has been a lot better than in JRC. // I'm not sure why I have fallen into writing my own musing here, but that's my field report from Bucksbaum."  In contrast, I find less uniformity and less reliability.  I hate computers.  And, after that musing, I had yet another bad day.

1. Feeling maudlin.  (Reflection on the last few  musings, all of which
   made me sad - Paul Nossiter, The Joe Stories, The Meaning of Things,
   Facebook reminders.)  I wonder why.  Is it that mom's birthday is
   this week?  Is it feeling my own mortality?  (Interestingly, these
   got spread out a bit.)

1. Implicit bias.  (Implicit Association) (What I know.  What I believe.  
   What the evidence suggests.  Vs. Explicit bias.  Etc. Etc.)
   <https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/>
   <http://www.lookdifferent.org/what-can-i-do/bias-cleanse>
   What about weight and age and ...?

1. SIGACT submission system?

1. A thirty-year committment.  (What they say about a new tenure-line position.)

1. What happens when a faculty member gets sick

1. Proto-musings: Facebook reminds me that when I was last on sabbatical, 
  back in spring 2012, I regularly posted a short note [1].  In some sense,
  they feel like "proto musings".  Some are about things I still feel,
  such as being overwhelmed.  Some are about large projects, although most
  of those were about art projects.  Blah blah blah.
  [1] Yes, I understand that that's how you're supposed to use Facebook.
 
1. Another workacholic: Little things add up?  An hour here.  An hour there.
   If you have thirty hours planned per week, you can spare about ten such
   hours.  But if you have fifty hours planned per week ....

1. And another workaholic (maybe?)

    <https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-I-Collapsed-on-the-Job/242537>

    > We are so free to work whenever we want that many of us end up working all the time, not having full weekends and rarely taking off more than just a few days, despite popular perceptions to the contrary. We bring our work home or anywhere we go — on flights or long drives, to vacations or family reunions. We are constantly checking email, responding to colleagues and students.  

    * My thoughts: In my case, I have base requirements that take about
  fifty hours per week.  Then there are the extra tasks that regularly
  get added: grading a larger assignment, reading through dossiers for
  candidates and conducting interviews, reviewing papers for a conference,
  support a student who is having severe difficulties, writing a series
  of recommendation letters, ....  My [recent musing about spring break](planning-spring-break-2018) just reinforces that.  I currently have something like 240 hours of outstanding work to do.  ...

### Delayed rants (hidden in the system)

1. Why I complain about software.  I complain a lot about bad software.
And I think a lot of software is bad.  Here I reflect more deeply about
these issues.

1. On representing dates and times.  Why I hate things like "12:00
p.m." or "6/12/64".

1. Why Grinnell staff with Ph.D's should be allowed to teach.  I thought
we allowed our Ph.D.-level staff to teach the occasional course.  Then I
learned that it's only in very specific situations.  These are my attempts
to think through the matter.

### Almost immediate (?)

1. Cleaning a GitHub repo.

1. <https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/smarter-living/today-do-that-one-thing-youve-been-putting-off.html>

1. Endnotes in electronic documents (From "the end of ownership", which distributes chapter 1, except without the endnotes).  And how we read.

1. The Hartl questions.  (Went from "Do the work; reflect."  To "Do the work, share it with me, reflect *on these particular questions*.  Take a long time to write, since I have to go through the whole chapter again, picking out the important things behind the scenes.)

1. Good will.  When you treat us as piece workers and contract employees, things break down.

1. Codecademy Ruby tutorial.  (I assign it; I think there are good reasons
   to use this kind of Tutorial; but, boy, there are many things I don't
   like.)  "Puts out every element inside the sub-arrays inside `s`."
   (This may have to wait until after students turn in the assignment,
   but I may want to write it earlier.)  `alphabetize` calls sort! (so it
   should be `alphabetize!`.  Mixes snake_style and camelCase for variables.
   Mixes puts and return strings.  (Dragon example. ...)

1. One of the assessment notes (see below).

### New "soon", normal length or possibly long (teaching)

1. Rubrics.

1. Advising assignment (for Joyce).

1. Detailed learning outcomes for CSC 151.

1. Grading Student Projects (See Janet's facebook post on Dec. 19, now at
   the end of this file).

1. Take-home exams.  (Why I give them, etc.)

1. Grading.  <https://www.chronicle.com/article/Why-I-Stopped-Writing-on-My/242477>

### New "soon", normal length or possibly long (other)

1. <https://www.chronicle.com/article/Another-New-Provost-/242830>

1. Cleaning up my list of forthcoming musings.

1. Scheduling students (for SIGCSE volunteers).  Update, rewrite, or buy?  
   <https://www.shiftboard.com/product/scheduling/>.
   <http://www.cervistech.com/>

1. Losing weight (or the history of my weight).

1. History vs. CS.  Tenure-track jobs.  Alternative opportunities.

1. Twelve-month contracts.  (And how they are not nice to staff.)

1. Don't embarrass me.  (Whatever happened to ...?  Will I ever teach
   it again.

1. Cleaning up musings?  (Somewhere between three and four dozen drafts
   of musings.  I'm not sure how many will see the light of day.  So a
   bit less than 10%.  Some I just deleted and will never remember.
   Others I moved to a separate folder to look at later.)

1. Customizing cover letters.  (I spend the few minutes to customize
   each recommendation letter.  Why do so many candidates fail to 
   customize their cover letter?  (No, we don't downgrade their 
   application for being generic.  But you can upgrade your own
   application by doing the homework.)

1. Social Media (and why I don't tend to use it except to announce musings).

1. The challenge of CS (You know when it doesn't work) and its broader
   effects, particularly given what we know about personalities.  Does
   "You are wrong" discourage women?

1. Taking classes.  One of the benefits of being at an academic institution
   is that I can sit in on classes of interest, at least when time permits
   [1].  During my last sabbatical, I was able to devote full-time work
   to Intro Studio and Sculpture, and part-time work to digital, intro art
   history, and art since 1945.  Since this semester is a bit quieter,
   I've made a list of courses that I'd like to sit in on.  There are
   three, and each is offered only this semester. ...
   [1] I must admit that time rarely permits.

1. Too Much Music.  <https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2018/01/16/578216674/too-much-music-a-failed-experiment-in-dedicated-listening?utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20180118&utm_campaign=youmusthearthis&utm_term=music>

1. Grinnell is different.  Inspired by my "recent" dialog with Maddie K.
   Her email is entitled "Re: DIS" and is dated 2018-01-25.

1. Something about my notes from Amanda Hinchman-D.  Maybe "unexpected
   effects"?

1. Should I write something about cluelessness on economic status
   (my own, others')

1. Attending academic talks.  (Why I appreciate the abiity to do so.
   How I fit it into my too-busy week.  The tradeoffs involved.  See
   `time-logs-2018-03-05.md`.)

1. The size of the College, revisited.  (What the group concluded, etc.)

### New "soon", potentially short, teaching topics.

1. "Checking in ..." A teaching tip. (and more)

1. I am loath vs I am loathe vs I am loathed.  (I wrote the middle
   one.  Grammarly suggested the last one.  I realized that I wanted
   the first one.)

1. "As We May Think", a great paper to read and assign.

1. Reconfigurable classrooms.  Whose responsibility is it to "put it
   back"?  Probably add rant about the computer podium - we asked for
   a fixed one.  They gave us a movable one.  Guess what?  That means
   the cords get pulled out of the floor.  Things appear and disappear.
   (Or is this sharing a classroom.)

1. Weekly reports in CSC 322.  (Things I was going to write anyway?)

1. Annotating the course Web?

1. Pages in a course Web.

1. DRYing out my course webs.

1. Timeboxing (in CSC 321, from Janet).  Recent frustration at how
   to deal with timeboxing when students don't do as well as I would
   hope and I've guaranteed a minimum grade.  Adding reflections to
   timeboxed work.  ALl sorts of things.

### New "soon", potentially short

1. "Tell X I say hi."  It happened when I was visiting some colleges
   with youngest.  (You're at Grinnell?  Tell X I say "Hi".)  Students
   tell me alumni say it to them.  (That is, the alums say something like
   "Is SamR still at Grinnell?  If so, send my regards.")  I do it, too.
   But *why*?  Many of those messages get lost.  ("Which alum says hi?
   I don't know; I talked to a lot.  But many of them say hi.")  And it
   doesn't take that much longer to send the regards yourself.  So the
   natural thing to do would be to follow up the "send my regards to X"
   with a note sending your own regards.  I'm trying to do that myself.
1. "faculty" - singular or plural verb forms?
   http://www.dictionary.com/e/collective-nouns/.  When I write things
   like "faculty have chosen", Grammarly always tells me to use "faculty
   *has* chosen".  But that feels wrong to me.  So I change my text
   to "faculty *members* have chosen", which makes both of us happy.
   But do I really have to change?  Let's see what the InterWeb tells me.

1. Bridging/interdisciplinary courses.  Which ones would I like to teach?
   Something on digital humanities with Erik or Sarah.  Someting on
   digital art with Jeremy, Andrew, and/or Justin.  History of computers
   with Mike Guenther.  Technology policy as part of policy studies.
   Piracy :-).  But more than any of those, I'd like to teach Tutorial
   again.

1. Using mail signatures as templates.

1. Cascading consequences.  Change in schedule of courses that eliminates
   one of our primary teaching slots.  So we start to move from 4x50
   to 3x80.  That's fine.  But then they tell us that we need to offer
   a minimum nubmer of 8:00 a.m. classes and they don't offer 3x80 slots
   that start at 8:00 a.m.  They don't count the 8:30 a.m. 3x80 slots as
   meeting the "start at 8:00 a.m." goal.  Putting together a workshop
   class is an incredibly time-consuming task.  So what do we do? (a)
   Move to 3x110, which start at 8:00 a.m.?  (That adds to faculty workload.)
   (b) Convince them to create an 8:00-9:20 slot?  (That's not so sensible;
   8:30-9:50 is better for eveyrone involved.)  (c) Get them to do the
   reasonable thing, and treat 8:30 classes as meeting the goal?  (It's
   CC.  There's no evidence they would do something so reasonable, even
   though I think that was their original plan.)

1. Followup on plastic pizza.  Something to with Adrienne seeing instructions
   to remove plastic from fish sticks.

1. Facebook, March 2 2012
   So, tonight one of my students asked me how I am different now than
   I was in college. I said there are obvious physical differences:
   While I have always been overweight, I am much larger now. My hair was
   also much longer in college. I said that I've always been obnoxious,
   introverted, and geeky. I told them Michelle said that I was clueless
   in college, although I did not relay her normal anecdotes. Michelle
   noted that while I've always been responsible about things like I
   work, I am now responsible for a family. Michelle also noted that
   I have more of a sense of social justice. Can my long-time friends
   suggest any other differences?  Andy: "You were never obnoxious, Sam. I'd add loyal and always intellectually curious.".  Michelle: "If I think back to college: the beginnings of who you are now were present. Today You are more confident and self assured. But you were always willing to try new things."  Rose: " i never thought u were obnoxious - - u were always very thoughtful. But i never knew how u found anything on your desk - - and yet u did".  Rose Ijaz: "I never thought of you as obnoxious. I always liked your sense of humor and judging from your Facebook postings, your humor has mellowed somewhat."  Charles: "Stronger and way more self confident. A bit less humble. More introverted. And you tend to a greater "big picture" philosophy."

1. Proscrastination or Overwork?  (Reflection on Michelle's response
   to "Feeling fortunate."  " No- you definitely procrastinate along with being overworked.")

1. My blue blazer.

1. Version numbers.  Why do I change after one period, or two, or ...?

1. "Myself" ("Please send it to myself")

1. Advisory panel.

1. Signatures (speeding up my life with those).

1. Sentient and malicious.  See day 3 of CSC 151.

1. The old shotgun apartment.  (Walking by Powell's.  Etc.)

1. Fall job interviews.  (Tapia + GHC + A third conference + interviews)
   A huge change.

1. Inbox zero.  Your Memories on Facebook recently came up with musing
   189, "Inbox zero, stage 1."  `inbox-zero-01`.  Boy, was "inbox zero" 
   a failure.  Let's see ... as of today ....  WHy?  No system.  Mail
   comes in at an incredibly rapid rate.  Random spam because I have
   "popular" Web pages ("We've written this great resource on copyright;
   wouldn't you like to link it?") or because senders are incompetent
   (I've unsusbscribed from Democratic Party mailings at least a dozen
   times).  Too many professional emails (SIGCSE volunteers and SIGCSE
   listservs).

1. Every ten minutes.  (My new policy of standing up every ten minutes.
   I tend to get too focused.  ANy relation to Pomodoro?  I should look.)
   iPhone makes it nice.  But ten minutes always seems so quick.  And it's
   usually eleven, since I should walk for eleven.  But I haven't been
   doing it enough.

1. Room and Board at Grinnell and elsewhere.  (See the `act-tuition-survey`
   musing for links.)

1. Cpanel?  The joyful software for the old SIGCAS Web site.

1. Academic geneaology. <http://veblenhouse.blogspot.com/2017/04/the-usefulness-of-useless-knowledge.html>. <http://www.towntopics.com/wordpress/2013/02/06/who-is-oswald-veblen-imagine-princeton-without-the-ias-einstein-herrontown-woods/>. <https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=805>. <http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/veblen_oswald.html>.  [Moved up]

1. Socks and VPN?

1. The metal thing from Eckhart library - conic and plane.

1. Outstanding / Excellent / Very Good / Average/Below Average.  Who
   puts average and below average together?  Who doesn't give approximate
   percentages?  Here's a better one: Top 1%, Next 4%, Next 5%, next 15%,
   next 25%, lowest 50%.  How long have you known the candidate?
   Less than 1 year / 1-2 years / 3-5 years / 6-10 years / more than
   ten years.  Truly exceptoinal (Top 1%), Outsstanding (96-99%),
   Superior (91-95%), Good (81-90%) Somewhat above average (71-80%),
   Average (51-70%), Below average (< 50%).

1. Github.  (I use it in so many places.  It's strange not to use it.)

1. A new introduction.

1. Boundaries and limits.  In most occupations, when your workday (8-5,
   4am-12:30 pm, whatever) is over, you are done for the day.  As a faculty
   member, I find it harder to set boundaries.  There are always other
   things to do - more articles to read (and write), more teaching materials
   to prepare, more things to think about.  And boy this needs work.

1. Facebook memories.  Found in my Facebook feed.
   _February 24, 2012_
   Okay, I'm on leave from teaching. Why am I still finding that I have more work to do than I feel like I can physically do? (Some answers: I'm still doing lots of administrative work as department chair and a member of too many committees, the classes I'm taking take time, and thinking about studio art projects is really engaging.)

### Old "soon"

1. My first campus job(s).  (Too many!  Mentor for Math.  TC.  Mentor for
   CS.  When I hit more than 20 hpw, they told me that I had to quit.  But
   I volunteered instead.)
   <http://www.chronicle.com/article/What-I-Learned-From-My-Campus/241573>
   Learned community.  Learned teaching strategies.  Learned to be more
   careful about hacking the system.  That I like teaching.  That sleep
   is optional.  (Positives and negatives.)

1. Learning to advise.  (Did I write that already?)

1. "Can I have an extension?"  When to ask.  When not to ask.

1. "Things I wrote for other reasons".  Why am I labeling those when
   that's the initial reason I started this thing, whatever this thing is.

1. Makes no sense to me - Amount for student meals at conferences.

1. Whatever I do in 151 today - joy of tables?.

1. Five sentences.  (Slightly started.)

### New forthcoming musings (well, not so new any more)

1. My next Tutorial.

1. Overwhelmed by forthcoming musings?  (Many have been in the queue for
   more than a year.)

1. Mentor vs. Sponsor

1. Blasters and Del-Lords.  (If I recall correctly, some out there is
   a newspaper article that calls the Del-Lords the Blasters of NYC
   or something similar.)

1. Universal design: Don't rely on text in images in email messages.

1. Blasters and Del-Lords mixtape

1. Losing the members of President's Council?  Effect on ability to search?

   Didn't need more than "I had criticisms.  I was mistaken."

1. Microagressions?

1. Curmudgeon or Cheerful - Both!

1. How to be a curmudgeon in N easy steps.

1. David Feldman. One of the more interesting pickups from this series.
 Imponderables - clearly an area for a liberal arts
 student. Got Michelle through med school. Continues to be diverse
 in intersts - bridge, music, Posse, more. I'm still not sure why
 he reads my musings each day.  (He did write his own autobiographical.)

1. Sedona - Best of breed?

1. Curmudgeon - Letterpress "There's nothing in the world that can't
 be made a bit better by adding a curmdugeon. Except, maybe,
 ice cream."

1. Walrus series - Letterpress?

1. Why facebook doesn't provide context. (Followup to insufficient context.)

1. Evolution of CS department research labs. Old format: Tables for
 pair programming. New format: More open tables. TVs.

1. "Data People" and other people.

1. Tandy 102 vs. the Freewrite.

1. Business-size cards. (Buying too many. Then realizing their many uses.
 Codes of conduct in code camp. Random cards for CSC 151. Machine names
 (with directions) for CSC 151. And more!)

1. Islandwood and GOA.

1. Finish last Wednesday's mail piece. (Maybe never.) (I don't even know what this is any more.)

1. Building the CSC 151 Web site.

1. Kate Walker - you only learn about people too late ....

1. "Did I miss anything?" (There's a poem by that name, How does it feel when a student asks that question, etc.)

1. Revisiting Tutorial. I'd forgotten that I'd written some of the things
 that I've done. Tutee birthdays. "Please Raynard, can't I teach Tutorial 
 again?"

1. Building value for Grinnell (?)

1. BBC micro:bit

### A series on fun books?

1. CLC 17 - Contemporary Literary Criticism

1. Fun books: The 1924 College catalog

1. Whatever book my Grandmother is holding in that picture?

1. The legendary yearbook (Grinnell)

### All those outstanding anniversary musings (if it's not too late)

1. Favorites.

1. Longest

1. How much did I write?  (I can roll back.)

1. ...

### A series on addiction and organization

1. Organization - No one who sees my office and laba may believe this,
 but I really like organization. Why aren't they neat? Addication
 to accumulation and inability to get rid of things. (`organization.md`)

1. Addication to accumulation. Might find the next thing that makes me
 really really happy. (`addiction.md`)

### Old forthcoming musings

1. Syntactic sugar.

1. Essay ??? (Nontechnical): Respect

1. Essay ??? (Nontechnical): Belonging (?)

1. Essay ??? (Semi-technical): Ethics in our curriculum.

"musings")

General
-------

1. The Denver Trips.  (aka Driving research students to conferences in
Denver.)  EdMedia 2002 in the Death Van.  SIGCSE 2015 or so in the snow.
Some of my fondest memories are of taking my students to present their
research at conferences in Denver.  In the summer of 2002, I drove a 
death van [1] full of students to Denver for EdMedia.  As was the norm
in those days, they were the only undergraduates presenting.  We played
the picnic game and other care games for much of the trip.  I still recall
how furious people were at a horrible pattern in the picnic game [2].
Parked outside.  Etc. etc.  A bit more than a decade later, when SIGCSE
was in Denver, I tried again.  Snow.  More snow.  The interstate closed
down. 
[1] We called it a "death van" because the training I took on the van
repeatedly reminded us of how likely it was to flip and showed us a
video with lots of examples.  The name became less funny when we reached
Denver and heard that a crew of firefighters had just died in a similar
van when it had flipped.
[2] "I'm going on a picnic and I'm bringing [noun]".  The first person
to speak picks a pattern, such as "fruits" or "words that start with the
letter T" or "two-syllable words".  Everyone else gets to suggest words
and ask if they can also go.  If I recall correctly, the rule for the
game that almost got me killed was "Words that start with the same letter
as your first name".

1. The Montreal Trip.  Rachel ILM.  Vivek LinkedIn or a new job.  
Kumail Famous.  Erin Slate.  Isabela.  Not sure.  Sarah.  Just moved
on from Cloudera.  Damn.  Who else was there?  Did Ellie go?  She's
a famous physics educator with a new last name.

1. The old CSC 151.

1. LBRY.

1. Mindstorms.

1. CS department Outreach.

1. Scheduling grading time. I really need to have grading time as part
of my schedule, or I won't get it done. Should I start building Fall's
schedule now? Let's see ... for CSC 321, I need two hours per class period
for the reading journals and three hours per week for the homework. For
CSC 322, I should probably spend an hour per project per week reading 
through journals and code. Each class needs at least an hour prep. Oh,
this is going to be a fun fall!

1. More broadly: Putting together my schedule.

1. Reruns. (End of semester stuff, in particular: Week 14, last day of
class, etc.) (May wait until Spring 2018).

1. Treating your faculty with respect. (You should treat everyone with
respect. But you should understand the power dynamics in a classroom.
Don't do your homework for another class during class. If you have to
be late, send an apology. If you miss class, send an apology.)

Revisiting Topics
-----------------

1. At some point, I'll come back to topics.*

1. Naming week 14, revisited.

1. Dad jokes, revisited. (Misc)

1. How Grinnell has changed in twenty years, revisited. (Hmmm ... maybe
I'm less upset than when I thought about revisiting this.)

1. Maybe I should have used a 'blogging platform. (Or 'the form of this 
site', revisited.) Adena's community comment.

1. Feeling fortunate, revisited.

1. Thinking the best of others, revisited.

1. Convocation, revisited. (Some others share my opinions. Others
do not. That's not surprising. I still think we should have weekly
convocation. Here's a plan for doing so.)

1. Accumulation, revisited. (Do I do the "Dad-iction" joke?)

1. Mondegreens, revisited. (Find another name for them).

1. If you ask a prof a question, revisited (On Writing)

1. Proofpoint, revisited.

Notes
-----

1. *Note: Try to have about one hundred forthcoming topics at all times,
 at least until I reach the three-hundred essays month.* (See below.)
1. *Note: When I have writer's block, I should pick ten of the topics
 above and write an essay about what I plan to write for those ten.
 There should be an almost never-ending supply of that kind of essay.
 Title: "Things I plan to write about (Part of a continuing series.)"*
  * The first time I did this, I think I only wrote three of the ten
   essays within the next two weeks.
1. *Note: At some point, I might consider top-ten lists. Maybe a month
 of them.*
1. *Thinking ahead: Alternate months of assorted topics and focused
 topics.*
  * April: Assorted
  * March: More Grinnellians 
  * May: Topics, revisited
  * June: Assorted
  * July: Maybe CSC 151 or CSC 321.
  * August: Assorted
  * September: Planning three-hundred more essays (I'd have to write one 
   set of ten topics each day; that could be an interesting challenge)
  * October: Assorted
  * November: The not-so-great, excessively end-noted, American novel.
   (A novel as a series of essays.)
  * December: Assorted
  * January: Preparing the next book?
  * Eventually: Top-ten lists (?)
  * Eventually: Autobiographical (?; probably not)

Facebook memories

Samuel Rebelsky

Okay, I'm on leave from teaching. Why am I still finding that I have more work to do than I feel like I can physically do? (Some answers: I'm still doing lots of administrative work as department chair and a member of too many committees, the classes I'm taking take time, and thinking about studio art projects is really engaging.)

Note from Harly: Here's an honest question that sounds snarky no matter how I phrase it: why subscribe to something like Grammarly and put up with all its frustrations when you could just keep a style manual near your keyboard and pay attention to what you write?

Grading Student Projects

Janet: Why are student-defined projects so tedious to grade, despite giving students the opportunity to demonstrate their creativity? I think because they require real concentration to understand and careful judgment to assign grades to. Unlike homework assignments, there's not much benefit to grading them in batches because they have so little in common. The context switches get tiring. Next time I need to find a different way to approach this.

Jim Huggins: There's no opportunity for you to gain expertise in grading. This is what we see all the time in grading the APCSA exam. Most questions experience a speed-up in time required to score a given response as the week progresses, because readers gain experience with most of the common patterns of responses. (That assumes that a given question has only a few response patterns; when that doesn't happen, neither does the speedup.)

Susan Sanning: I've often thought it would be interesting to ask students to create a grading rubric for their self-defined project.

Janet Burge:  One of my colleagues has 20% of their project grade marked as "interestingness" and assigns it at the end. Then I can score the other deliverables using the same rubric (test coverage, use of tools, ...) and save the tough value judgements towards the end. Unless they want me to tell them in advance if what they did was interesting enough for full credit...

Patter Mattison Boothe: I was never able to find a homework grading rhythm, and preferred grading the student defined projects as a result.

I recommend taking an artist's view. Art professors grade student defined work constantly, and as such they trust their gut and sense of taste much more than most CS professionals are willing to do. Explicitly deciding to trust my sense of taste made grading custom projects a lot nicer.

Ellen Walker: Yes, but what is really frustrating is the need to justify your grades. I grade individualized student projects and I know going in what grade it deserves (using the "artists view") and then I have to make all the pieces add up right and the comments to justify it.

Janet Davis:  I have a hard time trusting my gut. I have a feeling this project will go one of two ways over time: Either I will figure out what I'm looking for and develop a detailed rubric grid, or I will go the other way altogether and grade only on the number of times students revise their work based on my feedback (great idea, Devon Wootten!)

Clif Kussmual:  I still struggle with this too. Some people me that they don't assign such projects because grading is too difficult or problematic - I feel my duty is to assign work that will most benefit the students, then figure out how best to grade it. I try to be up front about this with students and acknowledge that project grading tends to be more subjective than CS1 HW.
I try to use rubrics to clarify expectations for me & students, but sometimes I find that: a) the rubric and my instinct ("sense of taste") don't always match, and b) students try to game the rubric rather than work towards a good project. So I try to make the rubrics specific enough to clarify what I want, and vague enough that they can adapt to different projects, teams, etc.

Arielle Cooley:  I agree. Especially since we know that qualitative measures increase implicit bias, so for me it ends up being a little bit stressful and a lot of second-guessing (did I score this student too low because of a bias that I have? or too high because I am overcompensating for one I think I have?). Ack! The content is more interesting though.

Melissa Marks:  I've been experimenting with specifications grading - it does require that you know what you're generally looking for, but it results in a grading system where they did or didn't meet the minimum specifications for a basic passing grade (i.e. C). Higher grades can come from doing extra work or doing more sophisticated work (it's pretty easy to reward risk, interest, effort, etc. that goes beyond the minimum requirement without being more difficult or time consuming).

Codecademy Ruby Dragon Example, Step 14

<pre>
class Creature
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  
  def fight
    return "Punch to the chops!"
  end
end

# Add your code below!

class Dragon < Creature
  def fight
    puts "Instead of breathing fire..."
    super
  end
end

d = Dragon.new("Fred")
puts d.fight
</pre>

<blockquote>
    Add `puts "Instead of breathing fire..."` as the first line in our Dragon's fight method.
    Replace the return statement inside `Dragon`'s definition of fight with the keyword `super`. (No need to pass any arguments to super, since Creature's fight method doesn't take any.)
</blockquote>

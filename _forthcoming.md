my goals.*

think that fits.  I just don't write enough argumentative essays.  
(Does this one go in end-of-month?)

1. "relatable"

1. Misreadings: "Modern Python demands modern techniques" vs. "Monty
Python demands modern techniques".  (There was the one about choosing
schools vs closing schools)

I attempt to describe the relationship between these areas and the

Ralph Savarese's comment.)

Notes
-----

* *Note: Try to have about one hundred forthcoming topics at all times,
  at least until I reach the three-hundred essays month.*  (See below.)
* *Note: When I have writer's block, I should pick ten of the topics
  above and write an essay about what I plan to write for those ten.
  There should be an almost never-ending supply of that kind of essay.
  Title: "Things I plan to write about (Part of a continuing series.)"*
    * The first time I did this, I think I only wrote three of the ten
      essays within the next two weeks.
* *Note: At some point, I might consider top-ten lists.  Maybe a month
  of them.*
* *Thinking ahead: Alternate months of assorted topics and focused
  topics.*
    * January: C and Unix (that's right; I should write 'Don't Embarass Me')
    * February: Assorted 
    * March: More Grinnellians 
    * April: Assorted
    * May: Topics, revisited
    * June: Assorted
    * July: Maybe CSC 151 or CSC 321.
    * August: Assorted
    * September: Planning three-hundred more essays (I'd have to write one 
      set of ten topics each day; that could be an interesting challenge)
    * October: Assorted
    * November: The not-so-great, excessively end-noted, American novel.
      (A novel as a series of essays.)
    * December: Assorted
    * January: Preparing the next book?
    * Eventually: Top-ten lists (?)
    * Eventually: Autobiographical (?; probably not)

---

Software for indexing these pages.

* Strip punctuation with sed.
* Chop into individual words.
* Sort uniquely. [Up to now, we have one essay: How many unique words have
  I used?]
* Separate program that finds word in each essay.
* Put it all together.

Facebook memories

Samuel Rebelsky
February 24, 2012 ·

Okay, I'm on leave from teaching. Why am I still finding that I have more work to do than I feel like I can physically do? (Some answers: I'm still doing lots of administrative work as department chair and a member of too many committees, the classes I'm taking take time, and thinking about studio art projects is really engaging.)

Game night
==========

*An imaginary conversation.*

Sam, I notice that you always seem to have trouble getting musings out
on Wednesday nights during the summer. Why is that?

> I host game night on Wednesday nights.

Oh. What's game night?

> I invite the summer CS students [1] and a bunch of other students
over to our house to play games almost every Wednesday night.

That's interesting. Why do you host game night?

> For a lot of reasons. It helps build community in the department.
It gives me an excuse to straighten the house every Wednesday. I like
playing games. It gives me an excuse to accumulate games. I like
seeing my students. My children like playing games and seem to enjoy
having me host game night. It gives students the opportunity to see
me in a non-work situation. It ensures that there are at least a few
hours each wee in which I don't work. There are probably others that
don't come to mind at the moment.

What games to you play?

> All sorts. I always want to play _Yacht Race_, but I could not
convince anyone to play this year. We've played a lot of what I think of
as social games: _Bananagrams_, _Dixit_, _Codenames_, _The Great Dalmuti_,
_Anomia_, _Hannabi_, _Chrononauts_, _We Didn't Playtest This At All_,
and _Loonacy_ [2]. We've also played more serious games, including the
new version of _Roborally_, _Ticket to Ride_, _Carcassonne_, _Acquire_,
_Catan_ [3], and others I forget. I think someone brought _Dominion_
last week. There is also a group that regularly plays cards after the
other games are done.

Why are you italicizing the game names?

> They are similar to book or movie titles, which suggests
to me that they should be italicized. I see that others who
write about how to cite board games think the same way. Here's [one
example](http://moonflowerdragon.blogspot.com/2010/03/how-to-cite-game-in-apa-style.html).

[4].

How much of your time does game night take?

> It usually takes an hour or two to prep - buying food, cutting the
food, straightening the house, pulling out some games, and so on and so
forth. I usually takes thirty minutes to an hour to clean up afterwards.
We usually play from 7 p.m. until 11 p.m. [5], so an estimate of 6
p.m. to midnight is probably accurate - six hours per week.

And at midnight?

> By the time I'm done cleaning up, I'm usually ready to go to bed.

How much does game night cost to host?

> Let's see ... I usually buy about six pounds of fruit, a pound or
two of vegetables, three pounds of cheese, a few boxes of crackers,
a few boxes of cookies, crackers, some iced tea, some lemonade,
and maybe something else (e.g., soda, chocolate, gummy candy [6]).
I'll let you estimate.

Do you think it's worth your time and money?

> Yes. I like building community. I like playing games with folks.
I don't, however, like straightening up afterwards.

What percentage of the players are non-CS students?

> It depends on the week. About 50% most weeks.

Will you continue to hold game night in the fall?

> No.

Why not?

> Have you seen [my fall
schedule](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/Schedule/schedule.2017F.html)?
I don't have time. More importantly, my kids are unlikely to be able
to attend, which eliminates one of the key values of game night.

How about next summer?

> Almost certainly.

[1] And faculty.

[2] The played way too much _Cards Against Humanity_ last summer. For
whatever reason, they haven't played it this summer.

[3] Or _Settlers_, if you prefer.

[4] I should probably pull out my _Chicago Manual of Style_, but it's
on my shelves at work.

[5] Okay, I play from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. My children tend to play until
11 p.m. or after.

[6] I consider gummy candy the unofficial snack food of Iowa. After
all, they can be made with two of the primary food products of our
state [7].

[7] Corn syrup, from corn and gelatin, from pig's feet [8].

[8] I don't know where gelatin really comes from these days. Perhaps
a certain imponderable [9] author knows.

[9] "imponderable" is likely a trademark of that author.

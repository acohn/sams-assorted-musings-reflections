The other day, I was thinking about my parents and about card games.
I won't bore you with the reasons why.  My brain brought up a word.
"Claviash".  It's a card game I recall my father playing, or my mother
talking about my father playing, or both.

So I did what I often do when confronted with a partial memory.  I 
searched the Web.  In particular, I searched the Web for rules to
the game.

My first search was what you might call marginally successful.  I
could not find rules.  I could not find much at all.  But I did
find a line in an Arthur Miller play.  At the beginning of scene 3
of _The Man Who Had All The Luck_, one of the characters says
"There's no brainwork in this game.  Let me teach you claviash."
That context does suggest it's something my father would have played.
Was my father an Arthur Miller character?  No, probably not.  But
it feels like he inhabited a similar world to those characters, at
least when he and mom lived in NYC.  And, as far as I can tell, he liked
games with brainwork.

Faced with one dead end, what did I do next?  I considered other
spellings.  "Clabiash" seemed like a good choice.  It's similar.
I'd assume that my search engine would know to try "clabiash" as a
match in a search for "claviash", but it never hurts to confirm.
This time, the search engine thought "clabiash" looked like "clubbish",
but also gave me a possible lead.  A [discussion of the best card
games](https://bridgewinners.com/article/view/best-card-game/) included
a comment that "I don't personally play the game, but I know some
who would vote for clabiash."  The next comment, from the same
day, is "klaberjass, I think".  Ah, the joys of spelling, particularly
spelling of words that may come from multiple languages.

Given that spelling, the game is easy to find.  Wikipedia has [a
page on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaberjass).  I appreciate
the paragraph on "History and naming".

> According to David Parlett, this "popular and widespread two-hander has so many names, mostly variations on the same one, that it is hard to know which is best for universal recognition. Klaberjass is probably closest to the original." He lists the alternative names as "Clob, Clobby, Clobiosh, Klob, Kalabrisasz, Bela, Cinq Cents, Zensa". Other sources also list "Klabberjass, Senserln, Clobyosh, Kalabrias, Klab, Clabber, Clobber, Clubby". Another common name is Klabrias. This truly international game originates from the Low Countries and is particularly strong in Jewish communities. (For an earlier form see the history of Jackâ€“Nine card games.) 

"Particularly strong in Jewish Communities".  Yup, it's almost
certainly the game dad played.  Then there are the rules.  It's a
game with 32 cards, Seven to Ace in four suits.  It's a trick-taking
game, but also one in which certain melds of cards score points.
Melding reveals information to the other player, so there can be
disadvantages for scoring a meld.  That definitely sounds like the
kind of complexity dad would have liked.  It's also one his namesake
would enjoy.  Maybe we'll play when we're next together.

Is it still "popular and widespread"?  I'm not sure.  I'm not even
sure how I'd figure that out.  Are any card games still popular and
widespread?

You know what's especially scary, at least to me?  In [my latest
manuscript](eng207-3b-manuscript) for _The Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_, I noted that 32 is the number of cards in a deck with
four suits and eight cards in each suit.  I wasn't thinking of any
game in particular, just about cards, family, and the number 32 [1].
I wonder if somewhere, deep in the recesses of that thing I call a
brain, some aspect of claviash [2] resides.  Now I have to decide
whether to change that part in the next version of the manuscript
[3].

Now I want to remember the game my Aunt Mary (Harry's wife) taught me.
I feel like it had a snake name.  All I recall is that each round
involved a different number of cards and perhaps even had a different
goal.  So many things have passed through my brain, so many have been
lost.

**_Postscript_**:  It appears some people spell klobyosh with only
four letters, as "[Bela](https://www.pagat.com/jass/bela.html)".  I
don't see how one gets the expected pronunciation of that.

---

**_Postscript_**: I see that the game can even inspire [poetry](https://www.poetrysoup.com/poem/clabiash_1230766), albeit with the b spelling (clabiash).

---

**_Postscript_**: I see that the "Jass" games had their origins in the
Netherlands.  I don't think that dad learned claviash during our two years
there, but perhaps his knowledge of the game allowed him to play other
variants.  At this point, I will almost certainly never know.

[1] One reader of the essay thought I was thinking of Euchre.  They are
almost certainly wrong.

[2] Given the huge range of spellings, I don't think there's any harm 
in me thinking of it as "claviash".  What's good enough for Arthur Miller
is good enough for me.

[3] That presumes there will be a next version of that manuscript.  I
have not yet decided which of the manuscripts I'm rewriting.

In [a recent musing](honor-giving-grinnell-2020-01-03), I discussed
the _Honor Roll of Giving_, particularly the Honoraria section,
which lists the people or organizations donors wished to honor.

Here's what the introduction to that section reads.

> Each year, Grinnell receives gifts that are made specifically in
honor of meaningful Grinnell memories of living Grinnellians,
including alumni, students, faculty and staff.  Between July 1,
2018, and June 30, 2019, the following individuals and organizations
were honored through gifts and pledges to Grinnell.  Please note
the list is in alphabetical order by last name of the honoree. [1,2]

The Honoraria section is broken into three subsections, one for
Alumni and Students [3], one for Faculty and Staff, and one for
Friends and Others.  I certainly appreciate the broad range of
faculty, staff, and students who are honored.  That is, I appreciate
both the act of honoring and the people being honored.

There are also parts of that section that reveal much about Grinnell.
Here are some examples.  One alumnus gave in honor of Chelsea
Manning, Bernie Sanders, and Edward Snowden [4].  A variety used
the "in honor of" field to speak to union issues on campus: Three
in honor of the Grinnell Union of Student Dining Workers, one in
honor of students fighting for better working conditions, one in
honor of Union students [5], and one in honor of Union Busting.
Knowing Grinnellians, there is a good chance that the last one is
intended to be satirical.

As one might expect, there are also donations in honor of Posse.
And, because it's Grinnell, one appears in the Memorials section.
But perhaps that's appropriate.  While Posse lives on, with the
graduation of the Class of 2019, Posse at Grinnell does not.

The donation in honor of Norris 3rd East also feels particularly
Grinnellian, and not just because other institutions are unlikely
to have a dorm named "Norris".  Rather, it represents a desire to
honor Grinnell memorires, or so I hope.

The Memorials section has a nicely written introduction.

> Many members of the Grinnell community find memorial gifts to the
College to be an appropriate way to remember and celebrate a relative,
friend, or special faculty or staff member.  Grinnell is gradeful
to receive these gifts, which provide important resources for
Grinnell students and faculty members [6].  Between July 1, 2018,
and June 30, 2019, the following individuals and organizations were
honored through a memorial gift to the College.  Please note the
list is in alphabetical order by last name of the honoree.

Like the Honoraria section, the Memorials section is broken up into
subsections, including Alumni and Students [7], Faculty and Staff,
Others, and Parents and Friends.  I'm glad to see that people
continue to donate in honor of Tammy Zywicki '93.  Nonetheless, it
reminds me that we don't do enough at Grinnell to honor her memory.
Reading the Memorials section makes me sad, so I'm not going to
report on any other details.

[2] You can find some other comments on that paragraph in the earlier musing.

[3] Presumably, current students.

[4] They gave in honor of other people, too.  However, I assumed that if I
included enough, the donor would be more easily identifiable.

[5] As opposed to Confederate students?

[6] And, I would hope, staff members.

[7] It's incredibly sad when someone who would have been a current student
needs to be meorialized.

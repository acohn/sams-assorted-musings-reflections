I've been told that there's a petition to change the primary name
of Grinnell's sports teams from the Pioneers.  Why drop that name?
Well, the myth that the pioneers found and claimed this unclaimed
land is, as they say, a myth.  Claiming the land west of the
Mississippi [1] required evacuating [2] folks who were already here.
We should not honor those who participated in these kinds of
activities.

There are also a few folks who want to change the name of the teams
because we don't have a good mascot.  I'm not sure who much we should
care about that issue in choosing a new mascot.

I've also been told that suggesting a name change are not suggesting 
a new name.  They want it changed.  They don't care what the new 
name is.  This seems like an opportunity [3].  I wasn't musing when
I first heard about this issue, so I just posted a random comment
on Facebook.  But I'm musing again, so it seems worthwhile to lay down
some ideas in a musing [4].

One of my favorite suggestions was to allow each team to pick their
own name.  There are already teams on campus who have other names.
Some are varsity teams and, therefore, supposed to be Pioneers, but
still get referred to by the other names, such as the Mad Dogs
(Men's swimming), the Mad Ducks (Women's and non-binary Swimming),
the Purple 'Roos (Men's Cross Country), and the Bea$ts (Women's
Cross Country).  Others are club sports and therefore not designated
as Pioneers, such as the Wild Turkeys (Co-ed Water Polo), the
Fireballs (Women's Water Polo), the Grinelleanor Roosevelts (Women's
Ultimate), and the Grinnellephants (some form of Ultimate).  Of
course, the swim teams once named themselves the Buddhas [5], so
it's not clear that teams can be trusted to name themselves.

Here are some of the names I suggested.

* The Grinnell Derecho.  "You've never heard of us, but we'll flatten you."
* The Big G.  I'm probably influenced by one of my favorite sandwich
  shops.
* The Grinnellians.  Hey, it's what we call ourselves.
* The Grinnell Turbines.  Our land is filled with giant energy-making
  turbines.  Why not pay tribute to them?  And we could hand out little
  spinny things at games.  If we name ourselves the Turbines, can we 
  make "Wah Hey" our theme song? [6]

I was surprised that noone suggested "The Grinnell Snowflakes".

[1] And most, if not all, of the US.

[2] Isn't that a polite term for it?

[3] Back when we had custom application questions, I'm pretty sure that
one of the questions was something like "Suppose Grinnell were to change
its team name and mascot.  What should the new ones be and why?"  But
that goes back a decade or more.

[4] Have I noted how much I appreciate that "musing" can be an action
and a noun representing the result of the action?

[5] I'm not sure if they were just Buddhas or Mad Buddhas.

[6] A small subset of Bostonians my age will understand that reference.

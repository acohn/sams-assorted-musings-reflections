These times are difficult.  People are not themselves.  They are
scared, frustrated, tired, worried, uncertain.

We've gone from face-to-face conversations to face-to-screen-to-face
conversations, email conversations, text conversations, all these
incompletely simulated modes of communication.  Much is lost in the
transition: nuance, body language, "vibes", feelings we know but
can't describe.

It happens too often:  They say (or write or post) one thing; we
hear another.  We write (or say) something; they hear something
else.  Do we even share language?

Too much is often left unsaid, perhaps implied, perhaps unnecessary
in common times or common modes, perhaps just forgotten amidst
everything else.

They make mountains out of molehills or molehills out of mountains.
They fail to grasp our concerns, our perspective, our stressors,
our experience, us.  Or maybe it's the other way around.

It's easy to get angry, to lash out, to respond in kind, rather than
kindly.

Let's try another approach, one that's hard, harder still in these
difficult times.

Take a deep breath.  Remember that others are not at their best.
Assume the best of intentions, even when you don't see them.  Take
another deep breath.  Pause, reflect, empathize.  Reread or re-hear.
Rethink.  Chill.

Another breath.

**_Postscript_**: This musing represents an attempt to expand upon
something I wrote in a recent email.

> Electronic messages are sometimes too easy to misunderstand.  I've
been working on taking a deep breath, accepting that people are not
necessarily at their best, and assuming the best of others.  I hope
we all can try to do that.

But I wanted more.  These new words are not the ones I wanted, but
it's a start.  Writing is hard.  Revising is harder still.  Still,
I'll likely try again.  Just not today.  Or perhaps one of the many
better writers out there would be willing to take a stab at expressing
these sentiments with eloquence.

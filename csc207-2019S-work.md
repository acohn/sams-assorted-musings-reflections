Choosing work for CSC 207 2019S
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), CSC 207, Java*

I'm in the midst of class prep for the spring semester.  In addition
to deciding upon the [schedule of topics](csc2018-2019S-schedule),
one of the important tasks in putting together a class is choosing
the appropriate kinds of work to assign to students.  There are lots
of options.  Here are some that I considered for CSC 207.

* _Daily readings_ provide background information for the students.
* _Daily labs_ help students ground concepts in practice.  For many
  aspects of CS, you learn more from doing than from listening [1]
  and the labs provide the experience of doing.
  _Lab writeups_ help ensure that students finish and understand the
  labs, rather than just moving forward.
* _Weekly assignments_ can help students ground concepts, expand
  their understanding, and, at times, build a portfolio of work.
* _Reading journals_ with targeted questions help students make the
  most of their reading time.
* _Examinations_  Take home or in-class (Mid-sem?)
* _Weekly quizzes_ provide a way for students to check their understanding.
  It also gives me an opportunity to see what issues students face.  Perahps
  most importantly, low-stakes testing has been shown to be one of
  the most successful ways to help students learn [2].
* _Required flash cards_  require students to summarize what they've
  learned, which can help them retain information.  The flash cards
  provides additional benefit in that they xxxxx.
* _A final examination_

One of the first things to consider is student workload.  Each of
these components can help students learn (and, in general, will help
students learn).  However, if one includes them all, it places too much
burden on the students.  I sometimes joke that one possible reason that
blended classrooms [3] seem so successful is that they require students
to do more work, and more work generally leads to more understanding.
And, while I say "joke", I'm actually fairly serious.  Many of the
presentations about blended classrooms have the form "We started with
our traditional class and then added additional online activities."
In any case, while it seems like "the more you do, the more you learn",
one must accept that students have other classes and other activities.

There's also a question of faculty workload.

[1] "Doing" does not always mean "programming" and need not always
involve labs.  For example, I find that think-pair-share works well in
CSC 207 when we discuss the design of algorithms, abstract data types,
and data structures.

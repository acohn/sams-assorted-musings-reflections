Early graduation requirements
=============================

Dear Todd,

As you think about "levers" (I still dislike the term), particularly for students graduating early, I wonder if you might also take on the language used on the early graduation form [1]:

> Explain how your early graduation plan fulfills the “Elements of a Liberal Education” (see current Catalog) including coursework in the major and distribution in other areas such as native and foreign language and literature, quantitative studies and mathematics, natural science, the human sciences and humanities, fine arts, and athletics or other educative extra-curricular activity.

> Additionally, please advise specifically why you have decided to complete your undergraduate education in less than the required semesters of residency.

* "the human sciences" is an awkward term.  It's also not clear whether that's supposed to be the social sciences (I find it strange to group the two) or whether the social sciences are missing altogether.

* It's not clear why we've changed the tripartite quantitative reasoning component (mathematical models, statistics, algorithmic thinking) into "quantitative studies and mathematics".

* Shouldn't it be "fewer than the required semesters"?

* Wouldn't "educational" be better than "educative"?

Who writes these things?  And why is it the technical folks, rather than
the the folks who are supposed to care about language, who find themselves
attending to these issues of language.

Different than the editing I learned in Joe Williams' "Little Red 
Schoolhouse", partially because it's different than the writing we
were thinking about in that course; Academic and Professional Writing
is not the same as, and probably should not be the same as, Creative
Nonfiction.  There are overlaps, but the goals are different.

It's also different than editing my musings.  More difficulty articulating
that difference.

_Round one_

First set of changes changes seem to be more content oriented.  Here are
some examples.

Changed song from "Here, There, and Everywhere", which was the first
one I thought of, to "All Along the Watchtower".  The first is a
love song.  The second is a traditional Dylan vision of confusion.
Plus, the opening line, "There must be some way outta here", resonates
better with the meaning of the piece, as does "There's so much
confusion, I can't get no relief".

Changed the title.  "Fredric Brown's Only Mainstream Novel" is a
bit obscure.  Perhaps if I'd added the world's shortest SF story,
"The last man on earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on
the door." Or perhaps that's the world's shortest feminist story.

Tried to insert a reference to Annie Dillard, "another classroom,
Methodist rather than Episcopalian, or perhaps more promiscuous in its
spirituality".

Lots of minor edits as I react to 

"Now I'm even more enthusiastic to try" to "Now I 

Change "Did you know that Hamilton also has an open curriculum,
which their marketing department did not see a need to rename?" to
a statement.  The questions come from the student.

Lots of word and phrasing changes.  For example,  "You decide to
ask anyway" -> "You ask anwyay".

_Round Two_

Think way too much about the title.  _Feedback_, because it represents
a central theme of the piece and reflects back on the Hendrix/Dylan song.
_Apophenia_, because of the connections I'm making.  _June 17, 1882_
for the whirlwind.  

When I finished that prior paragraph, I realized that I had written it
in much the same voice as I was using in writing the piece.  I am clearly
too easily influenced by what I am reading or doing.  I guess that's life.

Rearranged the first paragraph into two paragraphs.  There was a middle
sentence in that paragraph that was not working.  I think it will work
better as an introductory paragraph.  I spend a lot of time rearranging
that paragraph and considering some details.  Do I just say "Zoe Leondard's
'I want a president'" or do I add something about the content "(it begins
'I want a dyke for president')?  I go back and forth on the matter and
conclude that I'll leave it as enigmatic, like many parts of the piece.

In response, add a few more examples of chaos.

The minor changes continue.  "Or perhaps I’ll say 'scientific study'.
Is there really a difference?" becomes "Or perhaps I’ll say “scientific
study”; is there really a difference?"  Why?  Because "Is there
really a difference?" is my question, and I've been putting questions
in another character's voice ("You").  This way, it's clearer that it's
my question.

I read it aloud.  That helps me find a few typos, a few puzzling
structures (in addition to the structures I intended to be puzzling),
get a sense of the rhythm.

I look for quotation marks.  Text on paper.  Some particularly nasty
thoughts in the middle.  More stuff on paper.  More stuff on paper.
Fake text on paper.  The metaphorical "Little Red Schoolhouse".  I drop
that one.  "Interesting".

I look for parentheticals.  I had more in the first version. I seem
to have naturally cut them down to three: "half pyramids (I once
knew their formal name)", "B.S., M.D., M.B.A.., Ph.D. (so many
letters!)", and "I might pull one out from a stack (always organized)".
The last is one of the parts of the assignment I gave myself: "Add
a reasonable, but somewhat sarcastic, parenthetical comment about
something unexpected you’ve just revealed about a character."
I think the sarcasm works well in the middle parenthetical.  I wonder
whether I should push it further: "so many letters; you think it would
be easier to form words and sentences".  But that seems excessive.
The first?  Perhaps I should look for the name.


_Round Three_

I know that I need to think carefully about sentence structures.  But that
means that I need to understand more about sentence structures.  It's time
to turn to _The Art of Styling Sentences_ and at least make a list.  Then
I can start to classify the kinds of sentences I've used and reflect on
what I need to change.

I finished the first draft of my piece for _The Craft of Creative
Fiction_ about five days before it was due.  I expected that would
give me a chance to edit it.  I knew that I would likely be looking
at a wide variety of issues that I always consider: organization,
word choice, sentence structure, things like that.

At the same time, I knew that it would be different than the editing
I learned in Joe Williams' "Little Red Schoolhouse", partially
because it's different than the writing we were thinking about in
that course; Academic and Professional Writing is not the same as,
and probably should not be the same as, Creative Nonfiction.  There
are overlaps, but the goals are different.  Most of my Williams-style
editing traditionally has to do with making sure that I've made the
actors subjects and the actions verbs.  That may be less relevant
here.  Williams also reminds me to look for ways to tie things together,
by repeating words, phrases, or concpets.  That's a good thing to 
check.

It's also different than editing my musings.  In part, that's because
I typically write the musings to a tight deadline.  In part, that's
because my goals in the musings are a bit different; I'm reporting
more than expressing my creative intent.

There are host of other differences, but I have trouble articlating
them.  So, let's look at some of the changes I've made.

_Round one_

In the first round, I thought more about content.  Here are some
examples.

I had [assigned myself](eng207-1b-assignment) the task of including
a song lyrics, spread out over multiple sentences.  In the first
version, I used "Here, There, and Everywhere", which was also the
first that came to mind, mostly because I'd written "Here _something_.
There _something_."  But we shouldn't stick with our first idea.
At some point, I realized that "All Along the Watchtower" (the
Hendrix version) would be better.  Changed song from "Here, There,
and Everywhere", which was the first one I thought of, to "All Along
the Watchtower".  Like many Beatles songs, "Here, There, and
Everywhere" is a love song.  In contrast, Dylan's song reveals more
lyricism and ambiguity, things we expect in creative nonfiction.
In addition, the opening line, "There must be some way outta here",
resonates better with the meaning of the piece, as does "There's
so much confusion, I can't get no relief".

Changed the title.  "Fredric Brown's Only Mainstream Novel" is a
bit obscure.  Perhaps if I'd added the world's shortest SF story,
"The last man on earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on
the door ..."  Or perhaps that's the world's shortest feminist story.
That's a separate musing.

I tried to insert a reference to Annie Dillard, "another classroom,
Methodist rather than Episcopalian, or perhaps more promiscuous in
its spirituality".

Lots of minor edits as I react to 

"Now I'm even more enthusiastic to try" to "Now I 

Change "Did you know that Hamilton also has an open curriculum,
which their marketing department did not see a need to rename?" to
a statement.  The questions come from the student.

Lots of word and phrasing changes.  For example,  "You decide to
ask anyway" -> "You ask anwyay".

_Round Two_

Think way too much about the title.  _Feedback_, because it represents
a central theme of the piece and reflects back on the Hendrix/Dylan song.
_Apophenia_, because of the connections I'm making.  _June 17, 1882_
for the whirlwind.    _Privilege_ because that's what it reveals.
_Failing to restrain myhself_ for obvious reasons.

When I finished that prior paragraph, I realized that I had written it
in much the same voice as I was using in writing the piece.  I am clearly
too easily influenced by what I am reading or doing.  I guess that's life.
Or maybe that's become part of my voice. I'm not sure anymore.

I split the first paragraph into two paragraphs, although not in
the typical first-half/second-half partition.  There was a middle
sentence in that paragraph that was not working.  I think it will
work better as an introductory paragraph.  I spend a lot of time
considering the structure of that paragraph and considering some
details.  Do I just say "Zoe Leonard's 'I want a president'" or do
I add something about the content "(it begins 'I want a dyke for
president')?  I go back and forth on the matter and conclude that
I'll leave it as enigmatic, like many parts of the piece.

In the response, add a few more examples of chaos.

The minor changes continue.  "Or perhaps I’ll say 'scientific study'.
Is there really a difference?" becomes "Or perhaps I’ll say “scientific
study”; is there really a difference?"  Why?  Because "Is there
really a difference?" is my question, and I've been putting questions
in another character's voice ("You").  This way, it's clearer that it's
my question.

I read it aloud.  That helps me find a few typos, a few puzzling
structures (in addition to the structures I intended to be puzzling),
get a sense of the rhythm.

I look for quotation marks.  Text on paper.  Some particularly nasty
thoughts in the middle.  More stuff on paper.  More stuff on paper.
Fake text on paper.  The metaphorical "Little Red Schoolhouse".  I drop
that one.  "Interesting".

I look for parentheticals.  I had more in the first version. I seem
to have naturally cut them down to three: "half pyramids (I once
knew their formal name)", "B.S., M.D., M.B.A.., Ph.D. (so many
letters!)", and "I might pull one out from a stack (always organized)".
The last is one of the parts of the assignment I gave myself: "Add
a reasonable, but somewhat sarcastic, parenthetical comment about
something unexpected you’ve just revealed about a character."
I think the sarcasm works well in the middle parenthetical.  I wonder
whether I should push it further: "so many letters; you think it would
be easier to form words and sentences".  But that seems excessive.
The first?  Perhaps I should look for the name.

In taking a photo of the marble sculpture, I recall a piece of it
sitting on my shelf.  That should be added.

_Round Three_

I know that I need to think carefully about sentence structures.  But that
means that I need to understand more about sentence structures.  It's time
to turn to _The Art of Styling Sentences_ and at least make a list.  Then
I can start to classify the kinds of sentences I've used and reflect on
what I need to change.

I started to read the book.  By the time I hit the second structure,
I realized that Ralph was right.  I don't think I've ever used that
structure, "S V DO or SC; S, DO OR SC".  But when I try to fit it into
the manuscript, it does not seem to work.  I'll need more practice.

Starting the book at least gives me some sense of what Ralph means by
sentence structure.  I do a quick read through to think about structures.
There's not a huge amount of variation, but there's some.  I've also
been playing with sentence fragments.  It's something that the authors
we've been reading do.  It's also something mentioned in today's class.
I think those give some variation.  I also work on rewriting some
sentences to provide more structure.

Follow more stupid inclinations.  Ralph mentioned drills in class.
I add a drill.  Ralph said, "Ambiguity.  Ambiguity.  Ambiguity."
I add the three words, spread across a paragraph.

Along the way, I notice a few things that I want to change.  Some are
based on issues raised in class today, either as part of the students'
presentations or in one of Prof. Savarese's comments.  Some just seem
more natural.  I rearrange a few sentences.  Cut a few more.  I've made
a few things too explicit; cutting helps.  Cut some of my side comments,
such as the Hamilton note mentioned earlier.  That helps, too.  Drop
the "You" from the first paragraph.  It wasn't necessary.  Cutting
feels good.

At the same time, I'm starting to feel too close to the piece.  I've
looked at the words enough that I'm either finding flaws where none
exist, or missing flaws that obviously exist.  Unfortunately, I
can't put it aside for a week, which might be appropriate.  However,
I can put it aside for another hour, during which I'll look at more
sentence structures or reflect more broadly on what I've learned
about writing.

I submit.

**_Postscript_**: The editing didn't break quite as evenly into
steps as I suggested above.  I often bounced between types of editing.
And, as I think about it, I never checked on of Williams' key issues,
making sure that the sequence of subjects carries the reader through
the piece.  Still, I think the voice I chose mostly gets the work
done.  The rhythm of the piece also seems to help.

Grinnell traditions I miss (but shouldn't): The 3 a.m. bakery run
=================================================================

*Continuing an occasional series of reflections on Grinnell traditions.
See the short introduction to traditions and Grinnell traditions
in [an earlier essays](grinnell-trads-pipe-cleaner).*

For my first decade or so at Grinnell, students had a tradition of
walking downtown to Danish Maid bakery at about 4am, right when the
donuts and other baked goods were coming out of the oven, to get the
freshest possible donuts.  There was even an official bakery run during
orientation week.  Although I never participated in the bakery runs, I
generally liked the concept of them.  They were a silly tradition that
did not involve alcohol and were not too harmful [1], and they helped
connect students with downtown [2].

However, that tradition is now long gone.  First, some Tutorial professors
discouraged their tutees from staying up (or waking up) to do the bakery
run during orientation was unhealthy.  Ideally, one should go to bed and
get up the same time each day [3].  Then, it disappeared from orientation,
presumably for similar reasons [4].  Two or three years ago, Danish Maid
closed [5].

Do students still stay up until 3am?  Yes.  We now have sponsored 3am
pancake breaks during [week fourteen](naming-week-14) and finals week.
I've objected to them, on the same grounds that others objected to the
bakery runs: We should not be offering incentives for students to disrupt
their sleep habits, particularly during a time when their brains need
to be working especially well.  I believe the response I got was "We
are not encouraging them to stay up.  We are acknowledging that they do."

Do we have events that get students downtown?  I think we've tried a
variety, but I don't recall any particularly successful ones.  It may
be that the donut runs were developed by students for students, and
those kinds of traditions are generally more successful than activities
designed by non-students.  Perhaps my student readers will take that as
a challenge: Develop a new tradition that does not involve alcohol and
that gets students to see what's downtown.  And no, scavenger hunts 
don't count.

[1] More on that later.

[2] Yes, you would think that our students would find it natural to 
regularly go to downtown Grinnell.  Unfortunately, for some percentage,
that's not the case.

[3] Yes, student readers, that includes weekend nights.

[4] Around that time, there was also a significant revamp of
orientation, so it may just have disappeared as part of the revamp.

[5] No, I don't think they closed because the bakery runs stopped.
I don't even think that was a contributing factor.

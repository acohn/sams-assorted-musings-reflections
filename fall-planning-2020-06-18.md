Grinnell College has now released [a reasonably large amount of
information about our plans for the coming
year](https://www.grinnell.edu/campus-life/health-wellness/coronavirus/students)
to the outside world.  These plans include 7.5-week "terms" to
replace our 15-week semesters"; a mix of in-person, online, and
hybrid classes; regular testing of students (and, I assume, faculty
and staff); small communities called "scurries" [1]; and much more.

Within the next short period of time [3], departments and individual
faculty will need to make a lot of decisions about our courses.
We'll need to determine which of our fall courses, originally
scheduled in semesters, go in each term.  We'll need to figure out
what to do when a faculty member was scheduled for three courses
in the fall since we should only be teaching one course---or maybe
one-and-a-half courses---per term [4].  Almost inevitably, that
will mean canceling a course.  We'll need to figure out how each
course fits in the timetable: Is it three days a week, four days a
week, five days a week?  What time of day do we offer it?  Does it
have an accompanying lab?  Does the lab meet one day per week or
two days per week?  And we'll have to figure out how the primary
course model.

As far as I can tell, there are about six course models.  Because
we are requiring social distancing outside of scurries, classrooms
will hold significantly fewer students.  Our CS labs, which normally
hold up to thirty-two students and are usually scheduled with
twenty-four, will hold about six students.  So, for in-person
classes, we can either have a traditional format (small class or
scurry) or we can rotate students through the classroom, with a
fraction of the class doing each class in person and a fraction
doing it online.  We can offer online classes either synchronously
or asynchronously.  I've heard that evidence from the spring suggests
that students learn better and prefer synchronous online classes.
However, synchronous online classes can present difficulties for
students abroad and may exacerbate equity issues [5].  We can also
offer hybrid courses that have some in-person students and some
remote students.  And we could go to the extreme, and offer the
so-called HyFlex courses, that support synchronous in-person students,
synchronous online students, and asynchronous online students, all
at the same time.

I've heard that most students would prefer "traditional" in-person
courses.  And Grinnell will certainly offer some of those.  It will
be easiest with scurries.  But once you impose social distancing,
things get complicated.  Even if you have a small class (so no
rotation of who gets to attend), social distancing makes collaborative
work difficult.  Active learning doesn't really work in a socially
distanced classroom, and active learning is an essential pedagogy.
Scurries also aren't perfect.  Since the faculty member won't be
in the scurry, masks will still be necessary.  That means, for
example, that classes will be more difficult for those who rely on
seeing other people's mouths move: those with partial deafness,
some ESL students, and, oh, those teaching another language.  That's
right; part of foreign language pedagogy is looking at how people
make sounds.  That's hard to do "_en mask_", as it were.  Many
theatre and dance classes require enough physical exertion that
masks might present a health challenge [6].  And exertion creates
droplets of all sorts.  So, in many cases, online is *better* than
socially distanced in person.

In any case, I'll need to make my decisions soon.  I fall into a
moderately high-risk group; I'm male, obese, and getting close to
sixty.  I'm not over sixty, so that reduces my risk.  I'm O+, not
A.  But there's a risk.

Like my students, I want a return to normalcy, a new form of
normalcy that resembles the old normalcy, at least in how classes
operate [7].  I took a job at a place like Grinnell because I like
working face-to-face with small groups of students.  Evidence
suggests I do it relatively well.

And our testing regime seems strong.  We will isolate and test
students when they arrive in town, even before they get to campus.
We will test them regularly.  In theory, my chance of encountering
a Grinnell student with the novel coronavirus should be less than
encountering someone in town with the novel coronavirus.  But it's
a crafty virus.  If it gets into campus, it will spread rapidly.
I'm also likely to spend more time with my students than I would
with almost anyone in town.  An hour, each day, in the same classroom,
seems riskier than passing for a few minutes in a store or on
the street.

So the risk is hard to assess.  My initial assessment matched the
theory; good precautions and regular testing make it unlikely that
students will have the virus.  And so I was thinking of teaching
at least one class (my Tutorial) in person.

Then I saw [an article about Fort Benning](https://connectingvets.radio.com/articles/fort-benning-confirms-142-covid-19-cases-in-2-battalions).  Here
are a few relevant paragraphs.

> According to a release from U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, 640 new recruits arrived at Fort Benning and were medically screened and tested by medical professionals. At the time, four tested positive. All 640 recruits entered a 14-day monitoring period, with the four COVID-positive recruits isolated and properly treated.

> After the 14-day monitoring period, training operations began with COVID-19 prevention measures in place including masks and social distancing. Despite these efforts, however, eight days after the end of the 14-day monitoring period, one recruit reported to the chain of command with COVID-19 symptoms.

> All 640 recruits -- which form 30th AG Battalion and 2nd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment -- were retested for COVID-19. After all 640 tests were returned over a two-day period, that same cohort of recruits had a 22 percent COVID-positive rate with 142 positive tests.

Would the same thing be likely to happen at Grinnell?  There aren't enough
details, but it certainly seems that way.  Perhaps even more likely.  After
all, the test traditionally has a comparatively high false-negative rate 
and Grinnell's scurries seem to have fewer prevention measures than the
recruits have.  But maybe there's more to the Fort Benning story.  Who
knows what else was going on there? [8]

Let's see.  I'd like to teach Tutorial in person, even though I
think one could teach a good Tutorial online, but there are risks
involved in teaching in person.  When I started writing this musing,
I was pretty sure that I'd volunteer to teach it in person.  Now
that I reflect more carefully on the risks, I'm less certain.  I'll
need to discuss that one with my family a bit more.

What about CSC 151, which I'm also scheduled to teach this fall?
The course has some returning students in it, students who will
likely be online.  I'll be teaching it in the second fall term,
which means that it will be unlikely that I'll be able to have a
scurry.  It always fills, at least in recent years.  I hate mixed
in-person and online classes.  I rely on pair programming and other
active-learning strategies.  As far as I can tell, my only real
option is to go online.  I'd prefer synchronous, but that's something
to discuss with my department.

Oh, yeah.  There's also the one-credit CSC-281, Learning from CS Alumni.
I'm not sure whether that will go in F1 or F2; probably F1.  But
it will definitely be online.  The alumni guests won't be physically
present, so there's no reason for the students to be physically
present, either.  Plus, it's primarily intended for 3rd-years and
seniors, students who are less likely to be on campus in F1.

I've almost figured out which term each course will be offered and
what form it will take.  It's probably time to take a step back and
look at my department.

The first broad task is to figure out which courses go in F1, which
courses go in F2, and which courses go away.  I'm told that someone
is doing a large optimization problem to do a preliminary assignment
that limits the number of term conflicts, assuming that students
maintain their current schedules.  I wonder what other requirements
they put on the model.  Will it matter what we get?  I'm not sure.
I've set up a draft for the department and we'll discuss it on
Monday.

Stay tuned.

[1] In honor of Grinnell's squirrels [2].

[2] Scarlet the Squirrel is *not* our mascot.  Our teams are currently
the Pioneers.

[3] We haven't been told what that is.

[4] I believe that the rationale for the limit is that it contributes
to faculty wellness.  I expect that teaching two courses in a term
would be overwhelming, particularly given the rate of grading.  Students
have also been told that the one-course-per-term model helps ensure that
faculty are available for them.

[5] A student in a household with a good ISP, no responsibilities,
and no siblings and family members competing for computer resources will
be much more able to access synchronous course materials.  A student
with less good ISP; siblings they must watch, help, or share computing
resources with; a job; a troublesome home situation; or any of the thousands
of other challenges that currently present themselves, will find synchronous
courses more difficult.

[6] Limited oxygen intake.

[7] I'd give that up for a new normal that changes how class operates
and, more importantly, how race operates.

[8] I've heard that the Shadow knows [9].

[9] Or does the Shadow only know what evil lurks in the hearts of men? [10]

[10] Does that make the Shadow ineffective against female criminals?

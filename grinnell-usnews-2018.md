Grinnell's new _U.S. News_ ranking
================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), academia, colleg rankings*

Each yeer, _U.S. News and World Report_ releases rankings of a American
colleges and universities, grouped into a wide array of categories [1].
The _U.S. News_ rankings are an interesting creature.  Many people criticize
them for inappropriate priorities [2], some less-than-reliable methodologies
[3], and, for many years, a not-very-transparent system.  As far as I
know, _U.S. News_ has addressed the last issue; people clearly know how
much each factor is weighted and many factors are taken directly from,
say, [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) data [4].  Institutions are 
supposed to be careful in the data they report ot IPEDS [5].  

Because of these and other related issues, many institutions, including
Grinnell [6], have pledged to avoid using _U.S. News_ rankings in their
marketing.  I don't know whether or not these schools also refuse to
respond to the _U.S. News_ opinion surveys.

But most people also acknowledge that there's a wide array of people who
rely on the _U.S. News_ rankings in assessing institutions.  And so,
even though the College doesn't advertise its ranking or focus on
changing particular characteristics so as to raise its ranking [7],
we do pay attention.  I'll admit that there have been times that I've
worried about the potential effects were we to drop out of the top twenty.

For most of my time at Grinnell, our ranking has been in the mid-teens
in the list of National Liberal Arts Colleges.  If I recall correctly,
we were #13 in my first or second year.  Last year, we were #18 or so.
I also seem to remember that we dropped a bit when schools that were
not traditionally in that list got added to the list [8].  I also have
a vague memory that Carleton (now #5) was ranked right next to Grinnell
when I started.

In any case, _U.S. News and World Report_ just released their [2019
ranking of National Liberal Arts Colleges](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges).   And we're number 11 [9]!  I'm
pretty sure that's the highest ranking we've had in my time at Grinnell.

So, what changed from last year to this year that brought us up seven
slots?  I'd like to say that someone paid attention to the commitment
to the humanities evident in the HSSC or that it reflects Grinnell's
planned improvements to support of student wellness.  Or perhaps we've
made huge changes to the curiculum.  

But other issues are really at play.  We've traditionally been one of the
top teaching institutions, often ranked at #2 under "[Best Undergraduate
Teaching](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges/undergraduate-teaching)".
But we dropped to #5 or so in that ranking last year.  Why?  No one knows.
As far as I can tell, that factor is all based on opinion rather than
hard numbers [10].  And people once again think better of us.  Why?  I
don't know [11].

More importantly, [_U.S. News_ has changed the criteria the use and the
weights they associate with different criteria](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2018/09/10/us-news-says-it-has-shifted-rankings-focus-social-mobility-has-it).  _Inside Higher Ed_ tells us about one new criterion.

> New this year in the outcomes section are two social mobility factors that together make up 5 percent of the total ranking. One looks at the graduation rates of Pell Grant recipients, and the other compares Pell-recipient graduation rates to those of all students. 

I would expect that that criterion has a large impact on Grinnell.  Our
need-blind admissions policies [12] mean that we admit and enroll a large
number of students who could not otherwise afford a top-tier liberal
arts education [15].  Beyond the Pell-eligible students, we also enroll
significantly more "unable to afford full fare" students than do any of
our need-blind cohort, at least if the charts I've seen are to be believed.
While that's not necessarily the best thing for the long-term financial
health of the College, it does suggest that Grinnell can make more of a
difference in social mobility.

_U.S. News_ also tinkered around with a few other factors.  And, well,
rankings are pretty close.  We scored 88 points.  The number 10 school
scored 89.  The number sixteen school scored 87.  A little shift can
make a big difference.  My guess is that the increased emphasis on social
mobility [16], the tinkering with other figures, and a renewed reputation
of teaching all helped make some little shifts.  The combination of
those little shifts let us jump up the scale.

Postscript: I also find the _U.S. News_ rankings to be a topic of interest
because I've heard that they've become the tail that wags the dog, as it
were.  _U.S. News_ was a newsmagazine.  Now it's primarily a college ranking
service.

[1] E.g., national research universities, regional colleges, and national
liberal arts colleges.

[2] E.g., They rely heavily on SAT/ACT scores.  But those scores can serve as a
proxy for wealth of incoming students.

[3] E.g., Some values of ranking criteria are determined by surveying 
college and university presidents.

[4] Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, which is run by the
U.S. Department of Education.

[5] Of course, "supposed to be" does not
always correspond to actual practice.  There have been [numerous
examples](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2018/08/27/eight-more-colleges-identified-submitting-incorrect-data-us-news)
of colleges accidentally or purposefully submitting incorrect data to
_U.S. News_ and even to IPEDS.

[6] President Osgood made that pledge many years ago.  I assume we have
continued to follow that pledge.

[7] At least I don't think it does.

[8] E.g., the United States Military Academy.

[9] Admittedly, five schools are tied for #11.

[10] I do wish that there was a clearer way to evaluate quality of
undergraduate teaching.

[11] Perhaps the popularity of a certain disjoint 'blog has affected
views on teaching at Grinnell.  No, I think not.

[12] We do not pay attention to domestic students' financial status
in making admission decisions and we meet full demonstrated financial
need of domestic students [14].

[14] I am less sure about the policies for international students.  

[15] I realize that some people argue that I should not claim that
a top-tier liberal arts education is necessarily better.  I do plan
to muse about that issue in the future.

[16] Which many insist is still not enough.

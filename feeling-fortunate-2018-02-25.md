Feeling fortunate
=================

I just returned from the 2018 SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer
Science education.  Attending SIGCSE reminds me of how fortunate I am.

I am fortunate to be part of a professional community of really wonderful
and thoughtful people, people who share my values of providing students
with a well-designed and creative education in an interesting discipline
[1] and of ensuring that we broaden the audience who studies that
discipline.  I don't always agree with the approaches or perspectives of
everyone [2], but I can be confident that members of my professional
community approaches to CS education are grounded in care for the
discipline and care for their students.

I am fortunate to be treated as a valued member of that community.
People know who I am, take my opinions seriously, and share their own
ideas with me.

I am fortunate to have excellent students.  My students may not know
this, but I regularly got comments throughout the conference on the
wonderful interactions people had without them.  And they are excellent
in many ways.  They are not afraid to engage in difficult concepts.
They speak well about their work.  They are helpful and friendly.  And,
when they are asked to do work, they work hard and well.

I am fortunate to teach at an institution that has the resources to
ensure that students who have research to present are able to attend
a conference to present that research.  In general, our students who
had papers or posters accepted do not need to worry about the costs
associated with attending SIGCSE [3,4].

On the other hand, I am also unfortunate in that many people know that I
work hard and that I'm not very good at saying no [5,6].  So I sometimes
end up with more work in that community than is necessarily good for me.
But it's probably still good.

In balance, it's worth it.

Postscript: As I've noted in the past, my primary good fortune has to
do with my family.  I am very proud of my three sons.  I am married to
a wonderful women.  And my parents were thoughtful, inspirational people
who I strive to emulate.  But my experience at SIGCSE (other than missing
my family) makes me focus on my professional life, rather than my personal
life.

[1] That discipline is computer science.

[2] And I know that they don't always agree with me.

[3] Or any other conference.

[4] Our per diem is a bit low, but students get travel, hotel, registration,
and meals (up to $25/day) paid for.

[5] It may be worse than that.  I seem to be good at saying "I can do that."

[6] Some people know that I struggle with procrastination [7] and have
learned not to ask me to take particularly time-sensitive roles.

[7] Or perhaps just overcommittment.

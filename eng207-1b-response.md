I don't think that I can ethically share my peers' comments on my
piece with you.  I certainly can't share them with attribution.  And,
as both Prof. S. and I have said, "What happens in ENG-207 stays in
ENG-207".   I suppose we can say that we've had a wonderful experience
and learned a lot.

In any case, since I can't share either my peers' comments on my piece
or my comments on my peers' pieces (that would be even worse), I thought
I'd simulate what I might have written if I were tasked with editing the
piece I had turned in.  I'm not sure that I have enough space from
the piece yet, and there's a chance that I've been influenced by my
peers' comments, but it is, nonetheless, worth a try.

For this class, I've generally only written numbers on the page and then
typed (word-processed?) the comments.  I'm going to try to use my
endnote system, in reverse (front-notes?) to achieve the same goal.
I hope it works.

**Comments on "Office Hours"**

Dear Samuel,

Thanks for sharing your writing for workshopping!

I have broken my notes on your piece up into three sections.  In
the first section, I have notes from my read-throughs of your piece;
they correspond to the numbers I have written on the manuscript.
(My handwriting is not necessarily readable.).  In the second, I
have shared some general thoughts about the piece, based on my
readings.  They are not necessarily in any particular order.  In
the third, I include some final comments.  Feel free to let me know
if you have any questions about my comments or think that I’ve
missed or misread something.

I should also mention that I sometimes have a tendency to read and
comment too closely and too critically.  Let me know if you want
me to be a bit less detailed (or a bit less critical) in future
responses.

**_Notes_**

[1] That's a weak opening.  

[2] The repetition of "board" is awkward.  Perhaps, "There's a board
outside the door, containing ..." or "It contains ...".  (After reading
the whole piece, I think you want might to make it more explicit what
is happening: "Outside, you glance at the board, trying to see what
public face your Professor presents."  Or maybe "I present".)

**Office Hours**

There’s a board outside the door [1].  The board [2] contains an unexpected
variety of ephemera: a piece of cloth reading "Faculty for Self-Gov",
a colorful 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper saying "Safe Space", an
envelope full of Title IX resource cards, a reproduction of Zoe
Leonard’s _I want a president_, a Daniel Pinkwater standardized test
(on it, a student has scrawled "I took this!"), the ubiquitous "No
matter where you are from, we’re glad you’re our neighbor", cartoons
by Keith Knight and Gary Trudeau, a manifesto that suggests "As
citizens and computer scientists we are obligated to assess and
understand the impacts of computing on society",  a photograph of
a faculty member in a Tigger outfit, the cover of a book entitled
_Experiments in Java_.

The first thing you notice as you enter the room is the sheer volume
of books.  Or the oriental carpet, incongruous.  A red stapler.
The paper, piled everywhere---on the table, on the desk, on chairs,
on that carpet---piles, on piles, on piles.  Some playing cards, alone
and in decks.  Vases full of flowers at both ends of the desk.  A
drill from a dentist’s office.  Paintings and photos, displayed on
high and at angles.  A Barbie® doll.  What appear to be two red,
deflated, soccer balls, perched on a shelf.  Candy wrappers.  A
green plant, overflowing the top of the file cabinet by the door.
A slab of marble.  Your exam, carelessly strewn but nonetheless
sitting patiently on the table, awaiting discussion.

You deflect, or perhaps I do.  The large round stone, filled with
holes, perched on the shelf?  A fossilized whale bone, or so my
mother told me, found beachcombing on the Vineyard in the early
1970’s, back when we still went to the Vineyard.  The Tang Horse,
perched on its fading box, displayed proudly on the too-high window
sill?  Mom was invited to give a speech in China soon after it
opened to the west; she brought that back.  A giant, hand-painted,
uneven, somewhat oval, orange smiley face, tacked to the south wall,
and only visible once you sit down at the table?  One of my kids
made that; it makes me happy.  Which child?  I’m not sure.  Six
garish pink boxes labeled _What’s your point_?  One of my favorite
alums helped design that game, a hybrid of an improv activity and
a PowerPoint presentation with a previously unseen deck.  Those
red, appetizing, glossy, deflated, substantial, soccer balls?  I
took sculpture during my last sabbatical.  One of my fellow students
cast them.  I think they left Grinnell for architecture school after
that semester.  In any case, I liked their work and they were willing
to share.  I may have traded them a few of the half-pyramids (more
precisely, _Lower half, horizontally bisected square pyramid with
45° slope_) that I sawed, molded, formed, and cast.  Another peer’s
piece lies on the floor outside the office.  Perhaps you noticed
it.

The questions continue.  The stack of keyboards, piled in the corner?
ITS was going to throw them away.  I thought I’d pry off the keys
and use them for an art project.  I’ve since had the good fortune
to visit an exhibit of Elias Sime’s work at the Wellin.  Now, I may
be too humbled to start.  The slab of marble?  Rescued from the
discard pile when the sculpture near East Campus was made.  The
mailbox face?  Trash picked when the bookstore was closing; I recall
Kington making a joke when he saw me in the dumpster. In any case,
I appreciate the aesthetics and its ties to a Grinnell of old.  The
unassembled boxes, leaning against one of the many bookshelves?
I’m moving offices, a smaller space.

Some items seem somehow detached from the sentiments expressed in
the signs tacked outside the office.  Why the plastic, perky,
unnatural and unachievable representation of the female figure?
You think, "It’s somewhat creepy that an adult has that doll in
their office, still in the packaging."  I explain that it’s Computer
Engineer Barbie® and I bought it because I appreciated the effort
to encourage young women to consider careers in computing.  Plus,
Computer Engineer Barbie® has Tux on her shelf.  Libre!  I hate the
children’s book they released at the same time, a book which
completely undermines the doll’s positive message about women and
computing.  I prefer the feminist remix, which I have somewhere
else in the office, but pull up on my computer instead.  You think,
"They’ve said way too much about this doll, or at least have too
rehearsed an explanation."  Perhaps creepy is right.

You ask about the flowers and plants.  I must admit that they are
plastic.  But they do brighten up the place.  Once upon a time, an
alum, having recalled them, brought me a live plant.  It died within
the month.  Its corpse remains on the window sill.  Naturally.

An inspirational poster labeled Challenges reminds you of your
high-school guidance counselor’s office.  Surely college faculty
would be more sophisticated than that.  Then you read the underlying
message: "I expected times like this – but I never thought they’d
be so bad, so long, and so frequent."  You empathize, but continue
to wish your faculty would exhibit more sophistication.

Is that large framed poster containing a large photograph of a metal
object also intended to inspire?  And why is the glass cracked at
the bottom?  You lean closer to read, and learn that it quotes
Bishop Desmond Tutu, "We don’t want our chains made more bearable;
we want our chains removed."  Perhaps you’ve heard that quote
already.  Liberated.  You also learn that the accompany photograph
is by Reginald L. Jackson, Ph.D. and is entitled _The Shackle_.  Is
it appropriate for me to have such a poster?  Have I appropriated?
You don’t want to ask such questions.  I notice your puzzlement and
point you to the plate in the lower-right-hand corner: "Presented
by Community Change, Inc. to Dr. Freda Rebelsky in appreciation for
a lifetime commitment to racial justice."  Interesting.

You glance back at the table.  Your eye strays to a page of
hand-written hieroglyphs, seemingly scrawled by a left-handed doctor
after three consecutive nights of call, failing to notice their pen
is running out of ink.  You decipher some sentences.  The first two
read: "You enter the office, and query about Klein’s bottle.  They
regard your question, and respond using Magritte’s Pipe."  Your
brain speaks critiques---first quietly, then louder, then
unbearably---critiques echoing from a small classroom in the northwest
corner of a cottage on the southeast corner of campus, from one or
more rooms up the stairs from that classroom, from a seemingly
comfortable living room down the hall, from a Methodist temple to
writing promiscuous in its spirituality, from a seemingly quiet
oasis of wisdom deep in the belly of a hog butcher, from a metaphorical
Little Red Schoolhouse in a large lecture hall in a faux-Gothic
cathedral of knowledge in the pit of that butcher’s belly, from a
desk or small round table with but two or three people gathered
around.

> Too much symmetry makes this piece seem like it’s written by a
computer.  Know your audience.  Explain; not everyone will understand
your terms.  Vary your sentence length.  Vary your sentence structure.
Eschew obfuscation.  This piece is sophomoric, perhaps even puerile.
Ambiguity!  Don’t feel compelled to use the second person just
because that’s from the most recent piece you read.  Fewer adverbs!
Infuse your objects with meaning while acknowledging their
provisionality.  Don’t feel like you have to fit everything in.
Ambiguity!  My two-year-old daughter, in the crib, could write
better than this.  Don’t use the word "interesting".  Know your
genre; place is not memoir.  There are at least twenty basic sentence
structures; learn more than one.  Even competent writers struggle
to make meta-writing seem natural.  Thank you for this piece, it
will serve as a useful example of habits other students should
avoid.  Ambiguity!

You ignore the voices.  You ignore the voices.  You ignore the
voices, but they insist on being heard, raising new points, finding
additional flaws, encouraging the author, encouraging you to ignore
the obvious power dynamic in the room and share their words with
me.  You grab a fidget from the table to quiet the voices lest you
speak their truths.  They insist that you address at least one of
the critiques, at least to yourself, before they fade.

"You enter ... They regard."  "They enter ... I regard."  "I enter ...
You regard."  "Phil enters ... Prof. R regards."  "Student enters ...
Professor regards."  "Ashley enters ... I regard."  "Professor enters
... Student regards."  The combinations are nearly endless.

You settle on "You" and "I" for reasons you enumerate.  That quiets
the voices, at least for a time.  But why haven’t I done the same?
Unlike the president, who you’ve heard avoided writing courses in
his B.S., M.D., M.B.A., and Ph.D. (so many letters!), I seem to
embrace writing.  I must hear similar voices.  We’ve been through
that, that experience of detailed critiques.  You’re tempted to
suggest changes.  But this is not our fate.  The power differential
is too great; comments seem too risky.  You search for something
else to say.  You consider the volumes around you.

Have I read them all?  I’ve finished a few, perused parts of many
more, rely on the rest as references, save some that serve to support
students.  _From Barbie to Mortal Combat: Gender and Computer Games_?
That’s there because many of my students want to write about computer
games and I know it serves as a good resource.  Or, more precisely,
it once served as a good resource; gender and gaming has changed
significantly in the past decade.  A biography of Hallie Flanagan?
Most students don’t know that Grinnell’s Flanagan theatre was named
after her.  I appreciate a quote from Harry Hopkins near the
beginning, "President Main taught us the value of the arts, and the
WPA will reflect that value."  That’s what made America great.  _Sol
LeWitt: A Retrospective_?  I am enamored of his concepts, want to
live within those conceptual walls.  _Experiments in Java_?  No, it’s
not an anthropology text; it’s a CS lab manual I wrote in the distant
past.  I wish my publisher had chosen cover art that embraced that
ambiguity.

You page through the lab manual.  Computers are precise.  Computers
are organized.  Computers expect humans to be organized.  Zeros and
ones, neatly categorized.  Computers will not abide ambiguity or
subtlety or disorder.  How to explain the space which faces you?

Some peers have told you that they’ve heard me say that I’ve tried
to make my office look like the typical dorm room so that students
feel at home.  You ask anyway.  I might tell you that it’s an art
installation, in progress, entitled _Entropy_, for reasons that I
consider obvious.  Or perhaps I’ll say it’s a "scientific study,
in progress"; is there really a difference?  Speaking of studies,
I might pull one out from a stack (always organized) and show you
that researchers discovered that some people can achieve clarity
only by filling their lives with distractions; sensory overload
forces them to focus.  Are you convinced?  Perhaps not.  You’ve
watched enough TV to know that there’s a more obvious answer:
_Hoarder_.  You don’t know that buried deep---somewhere amidst the
piles of papers, or perhaps tucked in one of the books or under a
tchotchke---is an article that says that students become more
comfortable when they can find an object in the room to fixate on,
ask about, or use to initiate an extended conversation.

Now you’re ready to discuss the exam.

MAT-218
=======

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), silly, short*

The other day, I was writing about Grinnell's MAT-218, a variable-topic
course that we generally refer to as "Discrete bridges to advanced
mathematics".  In trying to verify the official name [1], I did a quick
Web search.  The list of results started with an advertisement for
Pig Absorbent Mats.

[<img src="images/MAT218" width="75%" alt="A Google advertisement that begins 'MAT218 New Pig Absorbent Mats | Buy PIG Absorbent Traffic Mat'">](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/preview_course.php?catoid=20&coid=44228)

I could not resist writing about that result.

My initial read of the advertisement was that the mats are designed for
swine and that I got the ad because, well, I live in Iowa.  I even thought
about jokes involving the mats absorbing pigs, rather than the mud
from pigs.  However, it appears that the pig mat is a disposable industrial
mat that you put on concrete and other floors to help keep them clean.
It even handles forklift traffic!

Still, I'm left to wonder about the relationships between foot traffic,
on the one hand, and graphs or number theory, on the other.

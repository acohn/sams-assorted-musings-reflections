*TL;DR*: The actual manuscript is available only as [a PDF 
document](files/Rebelsky-2B-CulturalCritique.pdf).  

Yesterday, I turned in my second manuscript for _The Craft of
Creative Nonfiction_.  I was assigned to write a piece of cultural
critique, or cultural criticism, or something like that.  I must
admit that I still don't quite understand what is involved in that
genre, even though my peers gave a great presentation on the topic.
Yes, I realize that I am supposed to write about culture critically.
But it feels to me like almost anything you write can critique
culture in some way or other.  But I did pay attention to issues
of form.  The writing instructions that Prof. S. asked us to read
in the _Bradway Anthology_ were all about the value of sources.  We
talked a lot about the role of the author in the piece; the author
should be present and have a clear voice.  I suppose that happens
in most good creative nonfiction.  Perhaps the description I liked
best was that cultural critique is like an academic paper, except
written using the tools of creative nonfiction.  That's something
I can get behind, even though my personal set of tools remains
somewhat primitive.

As you may recall from [yesterday's musing](eng207-2b-assignment),
I assigned myself to include a variety of characteristics that my
peers, my professor, and my psyche had identified in one of our
model pieces.  We had three: David Foster Wallace's "Consider the
Lobster", Wendell Berry's "Getting Along with Nature", and a section
of Stephen Kuusisto's _Have Dog, Will Travel_.  For reasons I describe
in that assignment, I selected the DFW piece.

What did I choose as a topic?  Social media.  Well, sort of.  A
particular aspect of social media.  It offends me when students
uniformly refer to the symbol "#" as "hashtag", particularly since
it is (a) only part of a hashtag and (b) should probably only be
called "hashtag" when it is used in that context.  So I wrote about
the name of that symbol, the loss of creativity that naming it
"hashtag" represents, and the loss of creativity that hashtags
represent.  Along the way, I inserted some snide comments on various
pieces of social media and added a brief history of Plans.  My early
draft also had a lot about teaching programming, but there wasn't
room for that part.  Perhaps I'll release that earlier draft later.

Unfortunately, that manuscript is one that I don't think will translate
as well to Web page form.  Why?  Because, in the spirit of DFW, I have
a *lot* of footnotes.  And part of the fun of footnotes is that they can
interfere with the main text [1].  I also enjoyed playing with the
footnote marks; since the essay was partially about symbols, I let
Word choose a sequence of symbols and did not allow it to restart that
sequence on each page, which violates the _Chicago Manual of Style_
and, I suspect, good sense.  So the twenty-one or so footnotes run
from \*, †, and ‡ to ‡‡‡‡, §§§§ [2], and \*\*\*\*\* [3].  After
all, if something is worth doing, it is worth doing to excess.

Hey, maybe that should be my motto.  "_If something is worth doing,
it is worth doing to excess._"  It can replace my old motto [4].

Since I cannot easily convert that rich text formatting to this
simple Web page, I will instead point you to [a PDF of my
manuscript](files/Rebelsky-2B-CulturalCritique.pdf).  Perhaps
you'll take the time to read it.  I wonder if you'll find that it
is anything other than an extended musing [6].  I hope you will.

Did I mention that Word won't let you footnote footnotes?  Here's
another huge flaw: Word also won't let you insert comments on
footnotes.  I apologize in advance (or, more likely, in retrospect)
to my editors.

**_Postscript_**: Bonus points to anyone [7] who finds the reference
to the legendary Second City sketch, "Football returns to the
University of Chicago".

[1] Word was less cooperative in giving me control over that interference
than I would have liked.

[2] I don't know why Word uses the section symbol for footnotes.

[3] One problem with using stars or asterisks in a Markdown document
is that the processor wants to interpret them as signifying a switch
to italic or bold.

[4] The last one I recall is "If you try to keep too many eggs in
the air, some will crash to the ground, but others will miraculously
turn into soufflés."  Or something like that.  But I recall sharing
that motto with Henry Walker back when his office was still on Noyce
2nd, in what I think is now Joe Miletti's office.  I must have had
some other mottos [5] along the way.  I'll have to ask Michelle and the
offspring.  In any case, I suppose that's a musing for another day.

[5] Should that be "mottoes"?  I'm not sure.  aspell says so, but the
Interweb tells me that either spelling works.  In any case, my writing
seems to keep my spelling checkers on their toes.

[6] At about 2,600 words, it's not even all that extended.

[7] Other than David James Sherman.

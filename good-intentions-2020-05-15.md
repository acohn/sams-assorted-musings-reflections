You know those days you make decisions (or sequences of decisions)
with good intentions, but they don't end up having anything close
to the effect you intended? That happens way too much to me. I plan
a nice dinner; I end up with chaos in the kitchen.  I plan an
interesting assignment; my students lose sleep.  I rant about an
issue; things change.  Oh, wait, that last one may be the effect I
intended.  It just doesn't happen very often.

In any case, I had one of those experiences lately and my muse 
insisted that I write about it.

First, some backstory.

As students in my spring 151 classes know, I love Scarlet and Give
Back Day, Grinnell's annual day (or day-and-a-half) of giving.  I
love the chaos. I love the giant squirrel costume [1]. I love the
simulated excitement of "If we make *this goal*, our anonymous
donors will give *this much more*! [3]"  But most of all, I love
the effects of giving to the College, of knowing that you can
make a positive difference, even if a small one, to a place you
value, or to part of that place.

Why do students in my 151 classes know that?  Because I always offer
extra credit for donating to Grinnell during Scarlet and Give Back
Day and for participating in Scarlet and Give Back Day activities.
I realize that not all students have the resources to donate, so I
also offer to give them the money to donate.  Why?  I want them to
have that sense of giving back to Grinnell, of thinking about the
future of the institution; that wonderful option of considering
where the money might go: to scholarships, to a sports team or
student group that makes a difference, to a department they value,
wherever.

I'm on sabbatical this year, and therefore not teaching 151.  So I
had been considering ways to hack Scarlet and Give Back Day [7,8].
For example, I thought about setting up a table right next to the
primary table, a table at which I would hand out dollar bills for
students to donate.

Then came the pandemic.  The College canceled Scarlet and Give Back
Day.  And, in any case, without the in-person aspect, any hack I did
would be much less fun.

But donations are important, particularly at this time.

So I thought about something else I might do.  Recalling the joy I
get when I hear that someone has donated to Grinnell in my name, I
thought about donating to the College in the name of each graduating
senior and talked it through with Michelle.  We decided to donate
$5 for each graduating senior.  And we decided to do it anonymously;
the goal of donating is not to get acclaim, it's to make a difference.
I also thought it would be better if students had to wonder who
would donate in their name [9].

We chatted with DAR [10].  They were generally amenable to the plan.
However, they suggested it would be more impactful [11] if our names
were included.  arguing that knowing that a couple of Grinnell
parents that includes a faculty member and a community member have
donated for you would be more meaningful than having to guess who
would choose to donate in your name.  We agreed, reluctantly.

We took a quick look at the letter that DAR told us they were sending
to students.  It was a bit more effusive than the standard donation
acknowledgement [12].  We did not read it carefully.  We did,
however, suggest the addition of one sentiment, that we appreciate
all that the student has brought to the College.  I sincerely believe
that each Grinnell student makes it better in some way.

Then the letters went out [14].  The first note I received was about
what I had originally hoped for (although we weren't hoping for or
expecting notes): "I'm not sure why you decided to donate in my
name, but thank you."  The second was from Middle Son, telling me
that the email had gone out.  The third was a complaint, a reasonable
complaint.

Like many students these days [15], the student was struggling with
finances.  And if you're struggling with finances, hearing that
someone donated in your name (and the implied "You should consider
donating") doesn't feel very good [16].  If you believe the College
has let you down through its recent actions and inactions [17], it
feels even worse.  And the pandemic has everyone on edge.  So the
student lashed out.

I'm working hard to be patient with everyone right now, including
myself.  I took a deep breath, reflected on the issues the student
raised, and wrote back.  I apologized for the way in which our
donation was taken, explained our reasons for donating, expressed
sympathy at their situation, and offered to discuss things we could
do better once they felt they had the time to do so.  I did not
suggest that the Grinnell of today only exists because of the gifts
of past Grinnellians [18], although it's something I regularly keep
in mind.  Such a comment would not be helpful.

I heard from DAR that a few students had also complained directly
to them.  I offered to write a similar note back to those students,
but have not heard back yet.

I thought things were done.

Then I got a note from two students, "We hear that others are upset
at your donation; we just wanted to say thank you and that we appreciate
it."  A note from a colleague, "Thanks for donating."  How did they hear?
Why did they feel compelled to write?  A note from my Dean, do I
want to chat about the situation?

We didn't want to cause extra work for other people.  We didn't want
our gift discussed.  We just wanted to make students feel appreciated
and to help support this institution we love.

What could we have done better?  I don't regret giving.  I don't
regret giving in honor of our students; I may not know them all, but
I know they are all amazing.  Perhaps we should have insisted on
anonymity.  Perhaps we should have requested that the honorees only
hear when the _Honor Roll of Giving_ appeared.  Perhaps I should
stop trying to hack systems [19].  Perhaps we should have written
a letter in our voices, a letter that acknowledged students'
current situations, that better explained our reasons for giving.
Perhaps.

**_Postscript_**: Perhaps I should have indicated when the backstory
ended.  I'll leave it to you to decide what is backstory and what
is story.

[1] I want to see a giant pioneer costume, too [2].

[2] Or perhaps some pie-on-ear jewelry.

[3] I'm still waiting for anonymous donors who match gifts to
particular recipients.  E.g., if I give $100 to the new Simple
Message Service [4] program, they will, too.  "We'll match up
to $###" [5] would be fine, too, as would "We'll donate $### to
any program that receives over # donations." [6]

[4] SMS stands for Science, Medicine, and Society?  I hadn't realized
that.

[5] The "#" symbols are intended as number signs, not hashes, meshes,
or pounds.

[6] Just spitballin' here, in case you couldn't tell.

[7] Just to be clear, I use "hack" in the old-school sense, to use
something in a way not quite intended with the hope of learning more
about it or creating fun and unexpected results.

[8] Apologies to my colleagues in Development and Alumni Relations for
my approaches to their event.

[9] As I said, I like to hack systems.

[10] In this situation, DAR stands for "Development and Alumni
Relations", not "Daughters of the American Revolution" nor "District
Attorney Rebelsky" nor whatever other DAR you were thinking of.

[11] I don't know whether they actually said "impactful", but it feels
like a DAR term.

[12] "This letter acknowledges that *Person Name* has donated to Grinnell
College in your honor."

[14] More precisely, email messages went out.

[15] Like many people these days.

[16] Michelle reminds me of what it was like when we were struggling
to pay bills, and we got a note that mom had had trees planted in our
names.  I expect we were still in much better shape than many of the
students who are feeling frustrated.

[17] I refuse to comment on most of the College's decisions, even
the ones I support.  I might not have made the same ones, but I
accept that people were working out of a spirit of concern, were
working on a tight time frame, and were balancing way too many
issues.  I'm not an engineer, but I've learned enough about engineering
to accept that almost every design represents a compromise.  I also
expect that decisions I might have made could have had worse outcomes.

[18] I think we can reasonably consider any past donor a Grinnellian,
even if they did not attend.

[19] Like that's ever going to happen.

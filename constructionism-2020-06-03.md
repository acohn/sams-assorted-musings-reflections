Yesterday, as I was talking to my research students, I realized
that I had failed to communicate some important aspects of the MIST
[1] project to them.  In particular, I had failed to help them
understand the constructionist perspective that grounds what we are
doing.

Today, I gave a short talk to them about constructionism, even though
that seems like a bit of a contradiction [2].  I thought it would be
useful to put some of what I said into writing, if only so that I have
a resource for the next time I have to talk to my students about these
kinds of issues.

I should, of course, start with a disclaimer.  Or perhaps a series of
disclaimers.  Let's see.  I am not an educational theorist, so much of
what I write in this musing is necessarily incomplete and incompletely
grounded in the broader literature.  My thoughts on constructionism have
been formed over casual encounters with the concept more than formal study;
however, I have read (or at least skimmed) a variety of sources.  Although
I advocate for constructionism, my teaching fails to achieve a full
embrace of constructionist pedagogy.  And, as I mentioned, it seems to
me that a talk or an article about constructionism is a bit of a
contradiction.  With those disclaimers, let's move ahead.

From my perspective [3], constructionism is a form of active learning.
Active learning is a broad pedagogical theory that suggests that
students learn better by doing, rather than just listening.  I'm
not sure why, but I tend to attribute active learning to John Dewey
[4], but I may be incorrect; certainly, active learning approaches
precede Dewey.  There are, of course, a wide variety of active
learning approaches.  The "flipped classroom", so popular now, is
one form [5].  A colleague of mine uses "peer instruction", in which
students answer cleverly designed multiple-choice questions in class
with clickers, discuss their choices with a neighbor, answer again,
and then discuss why and how they arrived at a final answer [6].
I even think of Socratic method teaching, particularly of forms
similar to that of _The Paper Chase_, to be a form of active learning,
even though that methodology clearly embraces the sage on the stage.

So how does constructionism differ from other active learning
approaches?  I think of it as a more extreme and more social form
of active learning.  Constructionism suggests that students learn
best when they are in a community of learners and their primary
goal is to create artifacts that they have chosen and design and
that they anticipate others viewing and using.  That is, student
choice, community, and interest are at the center of constructionism.
The instructor should build the community and provide the resources
for student communities to create.

Constructionism is a construct of Seymour Papert at MIT.  Papert was
a disciple of Piaget and, as I understand it, constructionism is a
mechanism to support what Piaget called constructivism, the notion
that each student creates their personal framework for understanding the
world [7].  Papert first developed his theories while developing the
Logo programming language, and the ways he encouraged people to teach
with Logo embody the constructionist approach.

These days, Mitchel Resnick, who I think of as a discipline of
Papert, carries on the tradition through the Scratch programming
language.  One thing I particularly appreciate about Scratch---and
that I've been trying to get my research team to understand---is
that Scratch supports a constructionist approach not only through
the language that students use to build projects, but also through
what I call a surrounding "ecosystem": Students can share their
projects, "remix" other students' projects, comment on projects,
and more.  They are part of a learning community.  Resnick's latest
book, which is on my "to read" list, phrases the constructionist
approach with Four P's [8]: Projects, Passion, Peers, and Play.
I would add "Public" but perhaps that's not strictly necessary.

I like constructionism because it embraces both intrinsic and
extrinsic motivation.  Students learn because they are working on
problems and projects they find interesting (intrinsic) but also
that others will look at, comment on, or use (extrinsic). 

I also consider constructionism important because of the way the
MOOC revolution has developed [9].  Most of the current popular
MOOCs and MOOC platforms follow a fairly traditionalist (perhaps
instructivist) model of education: You watch a bunch of lectures
and you do some homework based on what you supposedly learned in
lecture.  But the first MOOCs were constructionist; their goal was
to put together a community of learners around a topic, a community
that gathers resources and supports members as they learn.  Ideally,
we should refer to the original kind of MOOCs as cMOOCs and the
newer kind as xMOOCs.  But almost no one does.

Why did xMOOCs take off where cMOOCs did not?  Probably because by
the time we become adult learners, we are so accustomed to an
instructivist form of learning we are uncomfortable engaging with
a more constructionist form.  Or maybe it's harder to charge people
for constructionist education, so there are fewer resources available
to build and advertise.  I'll leave those issues for someone smarter
(or at least differently educated) than me to analyze.

As I suggested earlier, since constructionism involves learning
through creating things you want to create, it seems odd to try
to help people learn by lecturing or writing about it.  It's 
a constructionist activity for me, but not for my audience.

If you'd like to do your own exploration of what constructionism is
or what it could be, here are some resources you might rely on beyond
the results of a Google search.

* When I can't remember the difference between constructivism and
constructionism, I often return to a ['blog post by Mark
Guzdial](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2018/03/19/constructivism-vs-constructivism-vs-constructionism/).  Mark is one of the most thoughtful writers
I know about CS education and related issues.
* Papert's [introduction to an early collection of essays on constructionism](http://www.papert.org/articles/SituatingConstructionism.html) provides a more in-depth overview.
* Mitchel Resnick recently set up [Learning Creative
Learning](https://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl/), a kind of "course" on
constructionist learning, even if he doesn't refer to it as such.
* Strangely enough, while I was preparing the talk for my students, I learned about [_Code Nation: Personal Computing and the Learn to Program Movement in America_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3368274), which is currently available as a free PDF, but only for this month [10].  That text has a few sections on Logo and its impacts.
* Papert's _Mindstorms_ introduced many of these ideas.  My Code Camp research students appreciated reading it.  And you can get it as [a free PDF](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1095592).
* I love James Clayson's _Visual Modeling in Logo_ both because it has
  some fascinating kinds of imaging making and because it focuses on the
  experiences of students.  Clayson has recently made [a free PDF](https://www.academia.edu/5203649/Visual_modeling_with_Logo_a_structured_approach_to_seeing?auto=download)
  available [11].  Clayson also has some recent short papers on
  what he calls "Radical Bricolage", papers which I may have my Tutorial
  students read.
* As I think I mentioned, Mitchel Resnick recently released a book
  entitled _Lifelong Kindergarten: Cultivating Creativity through Projects, Passion, Peers, and Play_.  It's on my to-read list.  Maybe I'll make it the
  next choice for the Rebelsky book club.

And there you have it.  SamR's perspective on constructionism and
why it's important, and some resources through which you can construct
your own talk, essay, 'blog post, MOOC, collage, or any other kind
of project on constructionism.

**_Postscript_**: You know that longer volume of essays I mentioned?  Here's
the basic info.

Idit Harel and Seymour Paper.  1991.  _Constructionism: Research Reports
and Essays, 1985--1990_.  Ablex Publishing Corporation.

I'd like to take a look at that volume.  Unfortunately, it's long
out of print and the only copies I can find for sale are upwards
of $300.  Even WorldCat only shows a few copies available at other
libraries, and I'm pretty sure that Inter-Library Loan is not
currently available.

If anyone has suggestions about how I might obtain a copy, please
let me know.

[2] We'll see why in a bit.

[3] Yes, I realize that almost everything I write is "from my
perspective" and that I probably shouldn't write it.  It's similar
to my admonition to students not to write "I think" or "I believe"
I'm going to leave this first "From my perspective"; you can assume
that the remainder of the musing is mostly from that perspective.

[4] No, not of the Dewey Decimal system.

[5] In a flipped classroom, students watch a lecture or do a reading
outside of class, and spend class time working on problems.

[6] Most people I know credit Eric Mazur with the development of this
form of peer instruction.  Mazur was dealing with smart students in a
physics class who did well on exams but seemed to lack a commonsense
understanding of physics.  Here's a sample Mazur-style PI question:
You have a heavy rock in a boat in a relatively small body of water.
You toss the rock out of the boat.  Does the water level in the body
of water go up, go down, or stay the same?

[7] Yes, that is an extreme simplification of Piaget's theory of
constructionism.  It's about all my little brain can handle.

[8] These bear no resemblance to the Six P's I teach my students
to use when they document code: Procedure, Parameters, Purpose,
Product, Preconditions, and Postconditions.

[9] If you're not sure what a MOOC is, ignore the paragraph.  Maybe I'll
write about MOOCs another day.

[10] My quick look at the text raises some questions.  For example,
shouldn't "Learn to Program" be hyphenated?  And why isn't there any
real coverage of Hypercard, which helped an amazing number of people
learn to program?  "The author is from Microsoft" is not an acceptable
answer.  On a more positive note, I appreciate that one section is
entitled "Hold me closer, TinyBasic", which is the kind of title I 
would write.

[11] It's been hard enough to find affordable copies that I regularly
pick them up when I see them so that I can have them available for
in-person research teams.  I wonder what I'll do with them now.

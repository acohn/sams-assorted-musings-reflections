Comments on the summer MAP form
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), messages to administrators, things I was writing anyway*

Grinnell's Mentored Advanced Projects (MAPs) and Mentored Introductory
Projects (MIPs) can form an important and
useful [1] component of a Grinnell education.  In a summer MAP, a student
works full-time with a faculty member [2] on a substantial project,
one which, if successful, likely warrants broader dissemination through
a journal article or conference, talk, paper, or poster.  Grinnell also
has academic-year MAPs which are necessarily less substantial (12 hours
per week for 14 weeks is 168 hours, less than half of the 400+ hours
students work over the summer) but which also have some expectation of
external presentation.  MIPs can involve a similar amount of work [3],
but do not carry the expectation of external presentation [4].

The summer MAP paperwork process is "interesting" [5].  The first piece
of significant paperwork is a faculty members' application for funding
to the Committee for the Support of Faculty Scholarship (CSFS) which is
due at the start of spring semester.  In many cases, particularly in the
sciences, the faculty member applies for funding before finding students.
In other cases, the student finds and contacts the faculty member who then
applies for funding [6].  We usually hear back about those applications
a week or two before spring break, at which point we notify the student
applicants and give them a relatively short time frame to decide [7].
Soon after spring break, we send a list of our selected students to
the Dean's office.  A few weeks later (Monday of week 14, at least this
semester), MAP students need to send a form to the Dean's office
describing the work.  That form can either be an abbreviated description
of the research project ("Part A") or a complete description ("Parts
A and B").  In the former case, students must also submit a complete
description after a week or two of summer research.

I've never quite understood the purpose of the early Part A.  In the
old style of summer research, students spent the first week or two
of summer research doing the background research necessary to write
a proposal and wrote the proposal.  That's still the model I follow
and I believe most of my colleagues in the sciences follow.  If that's
what we're planning, why do we need anything in advance of the summer?
We don't need anything for the MIP students or the 399 students [8].
We've already written a description of the project for CSFS.  So why do
we need something extra for the MAP students?

Nonetheless, I accept that paperwork is a necessary part of the system.
I just wish this particular paperwork was better [9].  So I'm writing a letter
to appropriate administrators.  Here goes.

Dear Administrators,

I am writing to request a few comparatively minor changes to the current
Summer MAP Form and to suggest a larger change.

1. The question that reads "Is this a continuation of a current/previous
project?" is easy to misinterpret.  I've seen both faculty and students
check "Yes" to indicate that it's a multi-year project.  However, my
understanding is that the intent of the question is to determine whether
the student is continuing on the project.  I ask that we rephrase that
question to make it clear what is being asked.   Perhaps "Have you
worked on this project in a previous MAP?"

2. We use capital A and capital B twice on the form, once for parts A
and B and once for two sections of part A.  I've seen many students
confused that they have to answer question B in part A when they are
turning in only part A.  Could we perhaps use different lettering for
the "A" and "B" in part A.  Perhaps "i" and "ii" or even "a" and "b".
(It might also be more sensible to name the two parts "Part I" and
"Part II".  However, I expect that would also be more complicated.)

3. The form assumes a gender binary ("Approve her/his registration for
these credits").  I'd like to see us choosing gender-free language,
such as "Approve your advisee's registration for these credits" or
just "Approve registration for these credits".

4. As an adviser, I often do not find it appropriate to sign something
that says "Your signature confirms that the proposed project conforms
to the MAP regulations and to departmental policies."  While I can confirm
that a project conforms to CS department policies, many of my advisees
participate in MAPs in other departments and I do not know the policies
of those departments.  I also don't think it should be my responsibility
to learn about the policies of other departments.  Shouldn't it be
the Dean's office's responsibility to confirm that MAPs conform to
MAP regulations and the Department Chair's responsibility to confirm
that MAPs conform to department regulations?  I ask that you strike
the whole parenthetical remark.  Failing that, I ask that you strike
"and to departmental policies".

5. The link at the top of the form is to <http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/arc/academic-affairs/map>.  I believe that the information is now at <http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/dean/map>.  The link should be corrected.

In addition to those minor changes, I'd like to suggest one larger
change.  It is not at all clear how a student can answer the question
of "What makes this an advanced, integrative study" without describing
the project first.  I'd suggest adding another question that asks the
student to summarize the project in a paragraph or two.

Thanks for considering these suggestions.

Why am I complaining about these issues?  In part, it's that I see a lot
of extra effort going into correcting student (and faculty) mis-readings
of the form, particularly with regards to the "continuation" question
and the duplication of a "B".  In part, it's that I really do consider
it inappropriate to sign something that is not true and I don't think
I should have to learn the policies of other departments, particularly
since some of the policies may relate to information I may not have
access to (e.g., that a student may only do a certain number of MAPs in
a department).

Wait a minute.  That "number of MAPs" issue probably means that I
can't sign a statement that "the proposed project conforms to the MAP
regulations" either, since MAP policies [officially limit the number of
MAPs a faculty member does in a semester](map-rules) and I am unlikely
to have access to information about the number of MAPs a faculty member
is doing or to their teaching load that semester.  I'll try to remember
that when I next sign the form.  Should I just strike the phrase "conforms
to the MAP regulations" or should I add an extended narrative of the form
"except for regulations about MAP limits; after all, I do not have access
to the relevant data"?  That's a question for another day.

Postscript: This musing was supposed to be short and quick.  Then I
decided to write the background text.  Then I started exploring
[the College's MAP site](http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/dean/map).
Among other things, I was surprised to discover [a list of all the MAPs and MIPs since
Fall 2009](http://www.grinnell.edu/academics/dean/map/past_maps) [10].
That allowed me to learn a number of things, such as that [Elaine
Marzluff](elaine-marzluff) supervised 58 MAPs and MIPs in that time
[11,12].  I should turn those data into a more usable form and see what
other insights I can gather [14].

[1] Although neither required nor necessary.

[2] And, in many cases, with a team of other students.

[3] Some faculty run five-week MIPs rather than ten-week MIPs.

[4] Particularly since my MAP and MIP students work together, I also
expect that my MIP students will also develop work worthy of external
presentation.

[5] Air quotes intentional.

[6] Note that the "student-initiated MAP" model requires that students
are incredibly prepared; they need to propose the MAP to the faculty 
member about three months before student paperwork is due.

[7] I always have a long waiting list, so I want to be able to offer
the position to someone else if one of my initial choices has another
option.

[8] 399's are something in-between MAPs (499s) and MIPs (299).  Unlike
MAPs, which must be compensated over the summer, 399's and 299's can be
volunteer positions.

[9] Details follow in the next section.

[10] Why was I surprised to discover that?  Because I didn't think it
was considered public information.

[11] Amazingly, that's not the highest number.  I think Mark Levandoski
supervised 59 and Clark Lindgren supervised 60.

[12] I'm a piker.  I only supervised 50.

[14] It would be nice if they entered the data more consistently.
For example, I see Clark Lindgren listed as "Lindgren, Clark A.",
"Clark Lindgren", and "C. Lindgren".

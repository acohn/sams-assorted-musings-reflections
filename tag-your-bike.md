Tag your bike: Some advice for students
=======================================

The other day, one of my students said "My bike was locked by my dorm.
Now it's gone.  What I should I do?"  I said something semi-helpful like,
"Contact Campus Safety [1].  It does have a tag, doesn't it?"  They just
looked at me blankly.

So I talked to my kids.  They said something like "Tags?  You can get
bike tags?  I never had a tag on my bike.  I don't think any of my
friends have tags on their bikes."

So, here's a public service announcement [2].

> **Campus security has bike tags available.  They make it easier
  to recover your bike if it was stolen or lost.  Get one!**

Oh, and just so you know, the [Student Handbook](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=2536#bikes-skateboards-snowboards) [3] says 
that you *must* register your bike with Safety (or with Bikes To You or
with the police).

What happened to my student?  They filed a report with Safety.  They filed
a report with the Police.  While they didn't have a tag on the bike,
Bikes To You did have the serial number.  Fingers crossed [4]!

[1] Campus Safety is the office formerly known as "Campus Safety and
Security" and before that as "Security".  The hope is that by renaming,
we make it seem less intimidating to those who have had less-than-positive
experiences with the police.

[2] And it's not my traditional [Friday PSA](friday-psa).

[3] Warning!  Links change on the Student Handbook.  This one may 
eventually stop working.

[4] For those of you not familiar with the jargon, "Fingers Crossed" means
that you hope that something will happen.  In this case, we hope that the
bike magically shows up.

Acronyms you don't need: ROF
============================

As you may have noted, I sometimes find myself using acronyms that no
one else seems to use [1].  The most typical one is PITA [2], as in
"Trying to find the bug in this problem is a real PITA."  Some day I
may explain IDGAFF, which is something I say to myself in response to
some statements I receive.

Today's acronym that only Sam uses [3] is "ROF".  It's kind of like ROFL,
but without the laughter [5].  It's how I refer to musings like [my recent
commentary on _The Big Sick_](big-sick), or [my attempt to track down
information on what M Mark is doing these days](meanderings-2017-07-22),
or, well, almost any musing with more than a few endnotes.

Can you figure out what it stands for?

That's right, it's "Rambling Old Fellow".  You can feel free to substitute
a more gender-neutral, less polite for mixed company term for "Fellow".

Is it time to rename "SamR's Assorted Musings and Rants" to "RAF" or
"SamR's Assorted Musing and Ramblings ... That reminds me ..."?  Nah,
probably not.

Oh well, back to figuring out what "Sedona" stands for [6].  Then I
can decide whether I need a separate section for ROF-style musings.

recall correctly.

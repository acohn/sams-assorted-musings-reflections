Staff and faculty
=================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants)*

In my [recent musing on our next
president](grinnells-next-president-2019-12-06), I mentioned that
I'd like to see a president who can help heal the divide between
staff and faculty.  A valued colleague and friend noted that one
good starting point would be for the president to actively and
openly value staff.  I would add that the president should inculcate
that same attitude throughout the administration.  I would also add
that the faculty should make an effort to openly value staff.

My colleague also asked a question.

> I am curious how faculty feel undermined by staff. The power differential makes this hard for me to understand.

I wrote a short reply.  It went something like this.

> Particularly if we include administrators as part of staff, there
have been a number of fairly significant situations over the past
decade in which faculty governance was clearly ignored. These include
the changes to the Web site that have still not been resolved, the
failure to involve the committee responsible for the bookstore in
the review of the bookstore or in major decisions about the bookstore,
and statements and processes that dilute the role of faculty advising.

I also promised to muse more about the topic.  As you might guess,
this musing represents the result of that promise.  I'll start with
more details about each of those three issues.

Web site.

Bookstore.

Advising.  Addition of CLS advisor (which I support).  

Other issues.

8th Avenue Parking.

Where money goes.  "Our budget hasn't changed in a decade, even though
we are teaching significantly more students."  Seeing the growth in, say,
CLS makes that particularly frustrating.

Being told that we can't speak about the union and then having our
perspective associated with the College's anti-union views.

I should also reflect on why staff feel under-valued or undermined.

Salary is definitely an issue.

Public criticism is an issue.  Communications.  HR.  ITS.

I think Mike contributed to the divide by having staff teach classes
(or suggesting that staff should teach classes) without working
through the normal process.  It's a long-standing tradition that
only faculty members teach courses at Grinnell, but that some staff
members can be designated as faculty members by the faculty.  Mike
either did not know about that tradition or intentionally ignored it.
Certainly, he went so far to take the approval of one course to the
Trustees, rather than to the faculty. 

There are also issues that affect all of us.  Changes to benefits.

Staff and faculty
=================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants)*

In my [recent musing on our next
president](grinnells-next-president-2019-12-06), I mentioned that
I'd like to see a president who can help heal the divide between
staff and faculty.  A valued colleague and friend noted that one
good starting point would be for the president to actively and
openly value staff [1].  

My colleague also asked a question.

> I am curious how faculty feel undermined by staff. The power differential makes this hard for me to understand.

I wrote a short reply.  It went something like this.

> Particularly if we include administrators as part of staff, there
have been a number of fairly significant situations over the past
decade in which faculty governance was clearly ignored. These include
the changes to the Web site that have still not been resolved, the
failure to involve the committee responsible for the bookstore in
the review of the bookstore or in major decisions about the bookstore,
and statements and processes that dilute the role of faculty advising.

I then promised to muse about the topic.  As you might guess, this
document represents the result of that promise.

I'm a faculty member, so this musing reflects more of a faculty
perspective on the issue.  And one characteristic of the faculty
is that we can't easily separate the non-student employees of the
College into "staff" and "administrators".  It may well be that many
circumstances in which we feel under-valued or undermined are the
result of administrative action rather than staff action.

I should also note that my experience as faculty member is not
necessarily the same as those of other faculty; there are things
that bother me that don't necessarily bother other faculty and there
are things that bother other faculty that I consider appropriate.

Let's begin with some details of the three issues I mentioned in the
initial response: the Web site, the bookstore, and advising.

I've written about the Web site far too many times, both in these musings
and in letters to a variety of folks on campus.  But I may as well raise
the issue again and how it represents the undermining and under-valuing
of faculty.  

Until about six years ago, Grinnell's Web site was the typical
hodge-podge of materials.  While there were central materials to
provide information for prospective students, there were also
sections that clearly served the on-campus population, the broader
academic community, and perhaps even the world beyond.  Grinnell
had a generous Web governance statement that indicated that our
commitment to open discourse led us to allow anyone on campus to
have a Web site, faculty, staff, or student.

Then everything changed.  It was decided that the College's primary
Web site would only serve prospective students and their families
(and, perhaps, admissions counselors).

Advising.  Addition of CLS advisor (which I support).  

Other issues.

8th Avenue Parking.

Where money goes.  "Our budget hasn't changed in a decade, even though
we are teaching significantly more students."  Seeing the growth in, say,
CLS makes that particularly frustrating.

Being told that we can't speak about the union and then having our
perspective associated with the College's anti-union views.

Minor things, such as extra paperwork or extra delays when we try
to get things done.  Examples of having our job ad cut and not getting
data that I asked for.

Experience of being the only person in a building who does not get
a notification of important issues related to the building.

I should also reflect on why staff feel under-valued or undermined.

Sometimes it's the broad thing: "Faculty and students" rather than
"faculty, staff, and students" [pick your ordering].

Salary is definitely an issue.  I recall one of the public budget
meetings [whatever happened to those] in which a staff member reflected
that they see faculty salaries going up significantly faster than

Public criticism is an issue.  Communications.  HR.  ITS.

I think Mike contributed to the divide by having staff teach classes
(or suggesting that staff should teach classes) without working
through the normal process.  It's a long-standing tradition that
only faculty members teach courses at Grinnell, but that some staff
members can be designated as faculty members by the faculty.  Mike
either did not know about that tradition or intentionally ignored it.
Certainly, he went so far to take the approval of one course to the
Trustees, rather than to the faculty. 

There are also issues that affect all of us.  Changes to benefits.

I wonder if there are particular areas that feel particularly under-valued
or overly criticized.  Certainly, there are a lot of complaints about
ITS, HR, and Communications.  I'm not sure, but I think in the first
two cases, the complaints come from both faculty and staff.  While I
get frustrated with ITS, I also know that ITS remains under-resourced
for the amount of work they do and they face an increasingly difficult
technological landscape.  It may mostly be faculty who complain about
Communications;

[1] I would add that the president should inculcate
that same attitude throughout the administration.  I would also add
that the faculty should make an effort to openly value staff.

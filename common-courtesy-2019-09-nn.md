The other day, I reflect on [my practices as they relate to asking
students for their pronouns, and providing my own](2019-09-15).  In
response, a colleague pointed to [a similar piece from a few years
ago in _The New York Times_].  I took a look.  The author indicated
some of the concerns that I have: In particular, you want to give
students the option to state their pronoun, but you shouldn't require
them to do so.  They suggest being a bit more explicit about such issues.

Then I read the comments.  Now I'm angry.  Or perhaps I'm depressed.
Or maybe it's both.  The comments are likely what you'd expect.

> Probably about the most ridiculous thing that has emerged from the politically correct camp this year.

> To me, the most striking thing about this essay is that it considers only the "how/when"of eliciting "preferred pronouns" from students in a class. It seems the "whether" is assumed.

> Thanks liberal media for giving my conservative friends one more victim story to taunt me over. 

Do people not get it?  Here's the simple explanation.

**Addressing people by their chosen name and chosen pronoun is not
"political correctness", it's _common courtesty_.**

More musings I'll fail to finish
================================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta), rambly*

As I [restarted my "sketchbook" of forthcoming
musing](new-sketchbook-2018-11-nn), I not only pruned any musing that
was not yet categorized, I also eliminated some musings that I realized
it would no longer make sense to write about or that I realized were
low enough of a priority that I'd probably never get to writing a full
musing about them.  However, I hate to throw things away, so I thought
I would at least commemorate some of those topics by writing a paragraph
or so about them.  Might give readers a broader sense of the kinds of
things I sometimes think about.

*Beloit College.*
<http://www.beloitdailynews.com/news/20180824/beloit_college_grappling_with_financial_issues>.  A short mention in _Chronicle_ at <https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Daily-Briefing/238091>.  Why not anything bigger?  And why not anything bigger about the mindset list?  <http://www.rrstar.com/news/20180826/georgette-braun-beloit-college-drops-mindset-list>  Broader issue of peer colleges
struggling with enrollment issues.  Simpson.  Even rumors of difficulty at
Luther.

*Beloit's mindset list.*
See above.  It's now been taken over by someone (Marist?)

*Developing a work strategy.*  
One of my fellow Fellows at the Obermann center asked the rest of us
about the approaches we take to ensure that we make progress on our
work.  That seems like a good incentive for me to sit down and figure
things out.  I've been blogging daily [mostly] for the past two years
as a I way to get myself used to writing regularly and to think through
some broader topics of interest.  I use a task list manager and try
to put relatively small tasks on that list.  [Okay, I've used a wide
variety of task list managers.  For awhile, I used Trello boards.  These
days, I find that Todoist does the best job for me.]  Have enough of a
variety of tasks so that if I get stuck on one, I can switch to another.
But my time at Obermann is wrapping up and it's clear that my work
strategy was not a success.

*Saints Rest.*
Saw it.  But it's been about a month now.  Really intersting to consider
a movie that is set in my home town and is, in some sense, an homage to
Grinnell the town and Grinnell the College.  Great to see Jon Richardson.
Some parts that felt wrong, such as people walking on Main street as
they go home to a house on Broad street from Saints Rest.

*PCard Privacy.*
Okay, this is one I actually wrote.  Really frustrated.  But decided
never to post.  So I'm eliminating it from the list.

*Paper Rebel.*
Greeting cards.  Loved the name.  Thought I'd write something when they
released them to the public.  But didn't.  Seems less relevant now.

*Fun things that I can't attend: The Leonardo Convening* 
<https://www.leonardo.info/convening>.  Potentially part of a series.
I'm on leave; I thought I'd have time.  But I don't.  Missed ICFP, which
was in driving distance.  Missed SHOT, also in driving distance.

*The Google Thing*.  This was about what happens when something
sits in the sketchbook for too long.  Here are my notes from 
17 July 2018.

> I [recently wrote about some musings that I would never
write](missing-musings-2018-07-08).  Along the way, I noted that I had
a note that said "Application for Google thingy?" and I had no memory of
what it meant.  But I use Git to store my musings, so I could go back and
look when I'd added the line.  I added it on October 15, 2016, along with
a bunch of other musings.  So it kind of makes sense that I've forgotten.
I forget things I was planning a month ago, let alone nearly two years
ago.  I could look back at my email from then for a clue.  I can think
of two options: I'd been on a Google education advisory committee, and
I was considering whether to volunteer for more work.  I also regularly
think about asking Google for support for our local code club.

That's it for the notes.  It probably would have made a good short musing
on one of those days that I needed to muse quickly.  But I have enough
of those.  I also appreciate that it's evidence that I do need to cull
the usings once in a while.

*Requirements for our Web site (a note for the Web governance committee)*.
Here's one that I seem to have added to the list, [written](grinnell-web-governance-notes), and then forgotten to remove.  However, I see that I had drafted an introduction earlier and forgotten about that, too.  Here's that introduction, which I wrote on 3 July 2018.

> As you may recall, I spend way too much of my time frustrated by the
damage that Communications did to our Web site about five years ago.
(add story) This year, the College finally re-formed the Web governance
committee.  Of course, they didn't meet much and when they did meet,
they scheduled meetings at times that the Faculty reps couldn't make.
But they are still trying to make progress.  Recently, someone asked
me what I'd like to see in terms of campus Web resources.  This musing
represents my attempt to think through that question in more depth.

That reminds me:  There was a followup discussion about the MathLAN Web
servers which I should muse about.

*Grammarly vs. MS Word*.
I have no memory of what this one was supposed to be about.  I assume
it's about my experience of trying to open and edit Word documents in
Grammarly.  Given that I can't remember, I can delete the topic.

*Syntatic sugar*.
Damn.  I recall encountering a situation in which I was talking about
the value of syntactic sugar.  Or maybe it was that I was upset about
the amount of syntactic sugar necessary for something.  Or perhaps I
wanted to explain the term.  In any case, it no longer seems to be a
priority.

*The five types of professors*.
<https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-5-Types-of-Professors-/243108>
Every few days, I find an article (often in _Chronicle_ or _Inside Higher Ed_,
but also elsewhere) that makes me want to write about the subject matter.
Enough time has passed that I don't think I'll ever end up writing about
this particular article.

*We've been Ologized*.
If I recall correctly, I added this to my list after a particularly positive
session with the folks from Ologie, our marking firm.  But it's clear that
I'm always a bit suspicious of marketing, since I'd also added the supposedly
humorous note "Let's hope that we're not eulogized".  At this point, it's
not worth a full musing.

---

I cut more than those listed above.  Some that I've cut may become
relevant again, but need to wait until I feel inspired.  For example, I
had a series of "Things I should write for 282".  I cut notes on the inbox
zero project since that's on hiatus.  I'm comfortable knowing that all
the topics I cut live on in the old notebook.

Postscript: Naming.  never notate.  can't complete.  shan't scribe.  won't
write.  fail to finish.  (Something about reading?)

Correct spelling matters (at least to me)
=========================================

The other day, I received an email advertisement for
[MasterWriter](https://masterwriter.com), which claimed to be a set
of powerful tools to help songwriters.  Since at least two of my sons
regularly compose music, I thought it was worth taking a look [1].
The site was a bit vague on the features [2], so I decided to watch
[the introductory video](https://masterwriter.com/mwTourVideoTop.html).

It turns out that it's not so much a tool for songwriters as it is a
tool for lyricists.  That is, it helps you find near synonyms, rhymes,
and such.  It appears to do nothing significant with melody.  But I
watched more of the video anyway.

One of the next things I noticed was that they spell "alliterations"
as "alitterations".  They also say, "As far as we know, we have the only
alliterations dictionary on the market."  You think that if they cared
that much about the feature, they'd spell it right.  Or maybe there's
a subtle hint; by including "litter" in the spelling, they've told
us something about the quality.  You never know.

Given the focus on lyrics writing rather than song writing and their
lack of attention to detail, it's pretty clear that I don't need to look
any further.  However, given that I've been reading _Algorithms of
Oppression_, part of me does want to see what alternatives they
provide for certain words.  That's an exercise for another day.

[1] Admittedly, one of my first questions was "Does this run on Macs or
Linux boxes, or is it yet another Windows-only product?"  I didn't figure
that out.  There's a small chance it's Web-based.

[2] Never a good sign.

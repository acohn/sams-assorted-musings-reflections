From rabbit holes to dance bands
================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), rambly*

Today was one of those days that I fell through the rabbit hole
deep into the rabbit warren that is the Interweb.  It seems easier
to do that while on sabbatical; I appreciate the learning and I
don't have deadlines hanging over my head.  I'm not going to recount
all of the places I went, all of the sounds I heard, or all of the
text I read.  But it seemed appropriate to touch on two encounters
that seemed somewhat related.

Early in the day, I ended up reading some discussions of whether
David Allan Coe's "[Would You Lay With Me In A Field Of
Stone?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0-NbqMZmOQ)" stole its
melody from Townes Van Zandt's "[If I Needed
You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaP8NGML_QE)".  Since I looked
at the videos on YouTube, I ended up in some side warrens that
YouTube and my brain led me to [1].  But I kept coming back to
various song cover or plagiarism issues [2].  Did Led Zeppelin
really steal "Dazed and Confused" [3]?  Is Cyndi Lauper's "Girl's
Just Wanna Have Fun" a cover version if the original was never
released [4]?  And would you count Stevie Wonder's "Superstition"
as a cover, even though he wrote it, given that Jeff Beck released
the first version [5]?  And what about that [George Harrison
lawsuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWtjQbf2sn8)?  

Later in the day, while I was waiting for some time-consuming task on
my computer, I started to read Harlan Ellison&reg;'s [6] article
on titles in _Now Write! Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror_ [7,8,10] 
In the middle, Ellison&reg; writes,

> But when---way back in 1978---Jack [Chalker] saw publication of a short story with the absolute killer title, "Dance Band on the _Titanic_", everybody
wanted to assassinate him.  First, because the title was utterly dynamite;
and second, because the stupid story was *about* the dance band on the
_Titanic_". (p. 188) 

"What a minute," I said to myself, "Isn't 'Dance Band on the
_Titanic_" a Harry Chapin song?  In fact, it's not only a song,
it's also a record album.  The Chapin album came out in 1977.  The
Chalker piece and book of the same name came out in 1978.  But
artists often work on pieces for some time before they release them
[14].  So, did Harry Chapin borrow from Jack Chalker, did Jack
Chalker borrow from Harry Chapin, or was there just something in
the air at the time that inspired both to come up with the same
title?

Harry Chapin is dead.  Jack Chalker is dead.  Harlan Ellison is dead.
I guess we'll never know.  At least their work lives on.

Postscript: I wonder whether the title of this musing would meet
Ellison&reg;'s criteria?  I suppose I could have called it "A Journey".

---

Postscript: Wait a minute!  Ellison&reg; wrote "[First, There Was The
Title](http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?435681)" in 1977.  The
article references Jack Chalker's "[Dance Band on the Titanic](http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?192585)" which wasn't released until 1978.  How
does that work?  I guess Ellison&reg; was an even better futurist
than I thought [15].

at least see where some of my examples came from, you might peruse

[1] Tanya Tucker had a hit with "Would You Lay With Me in a Field
of Stone?".  She also had a hit with "Delta Dawn".  I always thought
of the latter as a Helen Reddy song.  I'm probably the only one.  Oh,
look!  There's [a clip of Dolly Parton on the Carole Burnett show]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CAPWKTjlrs)).  I'd forgotten how much I love
Carole Burnett; her facial expressions are priceless.

[2] Clearly, these issues are closely related to my scholarship and
teaching.  Or at least they are related to the Tutorial on intellectual
property that I've taught from time to time.

[3] Led Zeppelin stole a lot of music.  So it would not be surprising
if they stole this, too.

[4] I only consider something a cover if there was a prior released
version.

[5] Certainly not.

[6] Harlan Ellison is a registered trademark of the Kilimanjaro Corporation.

[7] It's a book I bought only because I saw it had a section by Harlan
Ellison&reg;.  I enjoy his nonfiction.

[8] Ellison, Harlan [9].  1977.  "First There was the Title".
Reprinted in Lamson, Laurie (Ed).  2014.  _Now Write! Science
Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror.  Speculative Genre Exercises from
Today's Best Writers and Teachers_.  New York, NY: Jeremy P.
Tarcher/Penguin.  Originally published in _Unearth_ magazine, summer
1977.

[9] No registered trademark symbol necessary, since he didn't have one in
1977.

[10] It's not relevant to this musing [11], but you can read
a nice [12] little piece by Laurie Lamson on meeting with Ellison&reg;.

[11] Is relevance an important factor in rabbit-hole musings?

[12] Albeit poorly formatted.

[14] I was going to say "That doesn't hold for me", given that I
plan on posting this musing immediately after I'm finished writing
it and doing a quick edit.  But then I realized that many of my
musings stay in the sketchbook for long periods, and some of those
musings are almost fully realized.

[15] More likely, he updated the piece for the reissue.

Guns

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), rambly*

Another month.  Another school shooting.  It makes me sad.  It makes me
feel hopeless.  It makes me fear for my own children.  It makes me fear
for my friends' children.

Reading the comments on the news articles make me sadder.  From the
right: "Students need to learn: Run from knives, run toward guns."  WTF?
From the left: "We need to change the second amendment."  "It's the
NRA's fault."  But, well, it's unlikely that our country will change the
second amendment in any significant way [1].  And, while I am happy to lay
some blame on the NRA for school shootings that involve semi-automatic
weapons, this shooting involved weapons that whose banning seems unlikely;
shotguns and pistols are part of rural life.

I don't know what the solution is.  I'm not even sure that there is a
solution.  Arm the teachers?  Get real.  More guns around leads to more
risk, not less.  Metal detectors at schools?  What happens when someone
sets one off?  You need an officer covering every entrance.  Most schools,
or at least most schools I've seen, have multiple entrances.  That's a lot
of metal detectors to add.  And you can't just lock all of the entrances
except one.  Fire safety says you need multiple exits and if there are
multiple exits, a shooter needs only one accomplice to let them in.

I hope that more thoughtful people can come up with realistic solutions.
I don't know what those solutions are, but I expect they will cost
money.  How will we fund them?  I'd suggest a 100% tax on all weapon and
ammunition purchases.  I realize that makes it harder for people to shoot
for food or for fun.  But we accept that other hazardous things incur
additional costs.  We pay taxes on cars to support roads and police.
We pay taxes on cigarettes [2] and alcohol.  If guns cause problems,
and they do, gun owners should foot part of the bill.

But guns aren't the only problem.  The bigger problem is that we have
young men who want to kill or damage other people.  Guns make it easier
for them.  But if we took away the guns, it's pretty clear that some
of them will find other weapons, whether knives or motor vehicles.
What leads someone to that state?  I wish I'd taken more Philosophy and
Psychology to understand the human condition better.

Of course, school shootings are just one of many examples of man's
inhumanity to man; they are just a more visible example.

As I said, it makes me sad and it makes me feel hopeless.  It also makes
me worry for our country and our world.

Sorry for the detour.  Tomorrow I'll return to writing about things that
are in the scope of "things I think I can change" or "things I want to
celebrate" or "things I'm competent to talk about" or whatever.

[1] It is possible that the Supreme Court will permit a changed
interpretation of the second amendment.  But it looks like the Court
is shifting in the opposite direction.

[2] Well, I don't.  Smoking killed my father.  I won't smoke.

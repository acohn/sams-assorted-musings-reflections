Like many people of my generation, I love the song "City of New Orleans"
by Steve Goodman.  And like many people of my generation who don't live
in the Windy, No-Longer-Second City, I know it primarily (or at least
originally) through Arlo Guthrie's cover version.

I will admit that I have difficulty identifying what I like about
any song [1].  For "City of New Orleans", I certainly like the
melody; it's a song you can sing along to [3,4].  But it's much more
than that.  Part of it is the framing of the song: It's a train song
(popular in the U.S.), it's even a nostalgic train song, but it
also makes it explicit that it's nostalgic and that the age of the
passenger train as a primary mode of transportation has reached its
end ("and the steel rail still ain't heard the news", "this train's
got the disappearing railroad blues").

Perhaps more than that, I appreciate his observations and they way he
turns them into carefully framed lyrics, "the sons of Coleman Porters
and the sons of engineers ride their fathers' magic carpet made of
steel", which is a wonderful pairing, or "pass the paper bag that
holds the bottle", which is so much better than the more obvious
"pass the bottle" or "pass the booze".

The other day, I was reading about the song on the Interweb.  It was
the result of one of those traditional labyrinthian Interweb paths.  I'd
been reading about John Prine, who passed away recently.  Prine regularly
played with Goodman [5].  That led me to read a bit about Goodman and
one of his most famous songs [6].

And I discovered something interesting.  There are versions of "City
of New Orleans" in other languages.  Now, these are not your
traditional cover versions, such as the Beatles' "[Komm, gib mir
deine Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qAazPVLONM)" [7,9],
which approximately translate the lyrics into the other the language.
Instead, these retain the melody, but discard essentially everything
else.

We'll start with Gerard Cox's 1973 Dutch [11] version, ['t Is Weer
Voorbij Die Mooie Zomer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23ORU2CZ5K4).
(You can read the lyrics and an approximate translation at the end
of this musing.)_ I'm not quite sure how to describe Cox's version
[12].  It has nothing to do with trains.  It's about summer.  Here
are a few of the lyrics, translated.

> We played golf and jeu de boule  
> We were happy in a chair  
> That summer started in May  

Such close attention to detail, isn't it?  Cox does echo the
nostalgia of Goodman's song, but Goodman's is a nostalgia that
admits it's nostalgic and that nostalgia is potentially problematic.
Cox's also notes some concerns, such as in the chorus.

> It's over that beautiful summer again  
> That summer started in May  
> Ah, you thought there was no end to it  
> But before you know it, it's all that summer long gone

The summer ends, but it's coming again, at least in my reading of
the song.  Maybe it's more meaningful in Dutch.  I do wish I knew
more of the cultural context, since there are at least two lyrics
that feel a bit pointed to me.

> Van haring geur vermengd met zonnebrand (*Herring fragrance mixed with sunscreen*)

> De ochtend vol van vogelzang (*The morning full of bird song*)  
> Het scherpe, hoge zoemen van een mug (*The sharp, high buzzing of a mosquito*)

At least in the English translation, that's doesn't bit like Goodman's
lyrics do, but it adds some interest to a song that feels sentimentally
trite.

Oh, did I mention?  There's a group of background singers who start
with a long sequence of "Na"s, and nothing like Wilson Pickett's
"Land of a 1000 Dances" [14].  They transform the folkie song to, well,
mediocre pop, at least in my world.  They also sing "oohs" on many
of the verses.  I know those aren't in the Goodman original, but there's
something like it in the Guthrie version.  Does Guthrie's version
use a pedal steel or a choir?  Can you believe my ears are not good
enough to tell?  I think it's a pedal steel.  I'll need to ask one of
my family members.

Next up is a French version by Joe Dassin, "[Salut les
amoureux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkEyV7_eNBs)".  And yes,
I've put the lyrics at the end.  Dassin, who I think inspired
Cox, has a much folkier version.  Like Guthrie and Cox, Dassin also
has backing singers in doing "oohs".  He also has them sing along
on the chorus.

Here are the lyrics to "'t Is Weer Voorbij Die Mooie Zomer", synthesized
from
[Google's presentation](https://www.google.com/search?q=T+Is+Weer+Voorbij+Die+Mooie+Zomer++lyrics)
of [Musixmatch's copy](https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Gerard-Cox/T-is-weer-voorbij-die-mooie-zomer/translation/english) [20].  I've reformatted, indenting
the English translation.

Toen sliepen we 's nachts buiten op 't strand

Here are what [Google presents](https://www.google.com/search?q=Salut+les+amoureux+Joe+Dassin+Lyrics) as the lyrics and translation.  Google claims to get
them from [LyricFind](https://www.lyricfind.com/), but I can't check
because LyricFind does not seem to provide a public interface.

The mornings follow each other and look alike

Les matins se suivent et se ressemblent

When love gives way to everyday life

Quand l'amour fait place au quotidien

We weren't made to live together

On n'était pas faits pour vivre ensemble

It's not always enough to love each other well

Ça n'suffit pas toujours de s'aimer bien

It's funny, yesterday we were bored

C'est drôle, hier on s'ennuyait




And we hardly found

Et c'est à peine si l'on trouvait

Words to talk about bad weather

Des mots pour se parler du mauvais temps

And now that we have to go

Et maintenant qu'il faut partir

We have a hundred thousand things to say

On a cent mille choses à dire

Too dear to your heart for such a short time
Qui tiennent trop à cœur pour si peu de temps
We loved each other like we part
On s'est aimés comme on se quitte

Simply without thinking about tomorrow
Tout simplement sans penser à demain

See you tomorrow which always comes a little too fast
À demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite

To the farewells that sometimes go a little too well
Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien
We do what we need, we play our roles
On fait c'qu'il faut, on tient nos rôles

We look at each other, we laugh, we skull a little
On se regarde, on rit, on crâne un peu

We always forgot something
On a toujours oublié quelque chose

It's not easy to say goodbye
C'est pas facile de se dire adieu

And we know all too well that sooner or later
Et l'on sait trop bien que tôt ou tard

Maybe tomorrow or even tonight
Demain peut-être ou même ce soir

We will say that all is not lost
On va se dire que tout n'est pas perdu

From this unfinished novel we will make a fairy tale
De ce roman inachevé on va se faire un conte de fées

But we have passed the age, we would not believe it anymore
Mais on a passé l'âge, on n'y croirait plus
We loved each other like we part
On s'est aimés comme on se quitte

Simply without thinking about tomorrow
Tout simplement sans penser à demain

See you tomorrow which always comes a little too fast
À demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite

To the farewells that sometimes go a little too well
Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien
Romeo, Juliet and all the others
Roméo, Juliette et tous les autres

Sleep in peace in your books
Au fond de vos bouquins dormez en paix

A simple story like ours
Une simple histoire comme la nôtre

Is one that we will never write
Est de celles qu'on n'écrira jamais

Let's go little one must go
Allons petite, il faut partir

Leave our memories here
Laisser ici nos souvenirs

We will go down together if you want
On va descendre ensemble si tu veux

And when she goes to see us pass
Et quand elle va nous voir passer

The patron saint of coffee
La patronne du café

Go tell us again "hello lovers!"
Va encore nous dire "salut les amoureux!"

We loved each other like we part
On s'est aimés comme on se quitte

Simply without thinking about tomorrow
Tout simplement sans penser à demain

See you tomorrow which always comes a little too fast
À demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite

To the farewells that sometimes go a little too well
Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien

[1] Maybe I should have taken a music course, such as the legendary
"Clap for Credit" [2].

[2] I don't believe this course is offered at Grinnell, so I don't
have the same ease of access I might have had as an undergrad, presuming,
of course, that I had the opportunity as an undergrad.

[3] As long as you can sing.

[4] "a song to which you can sing along", for *those people*.

[5] Did Goodman help Prine get started?  I don't recall, and I don't
want to get trapped in the Interweb again.

[6] To folks in the aforementioned City by the Lake, "A Dying Cub Fan's
Last Request" or "Go, Cubs, Go" may be more famous.

[7] Like many YouTube links, that one will likely have disappeared by the
time you folow it [8].

[8] You should assume that I've made the same comment about all of the
other links in this musing.

[9] I realize that other-language covers are done by other artists.
But the Beatles' German-language cover of their own song is the one
that comes most readily to mind.  I'm a lazy writer or at least a
lazy muser [10].

[10] Sorry Ralph.

[11] Ich kann kehn Nederlandsche sprechen, or something like that.

[12] I said that already, didn't I?

[14] You can substitute your favorite version, perhaps Cannibal and
the Headhunters'?  I believe they were the ones who added the "Na"s
to the original by Chris Kenner [15].

[15] I suppose that's another Interwebhole.

[20] Strangely enough, neither the lyrics nor the translation match
completely.

[21] The "ooh"s (however they are spelled) are not in the Musixmatch
version.  I think they are supposed to represent what the background
singers are saying.

[22] No, I did not count the "Na"s to see if they matched.

An introduction to the musing topics
====================================

*Topics/tags: [On writing](index-writing), meta, rambly*

As I noted in [the introduction](intro-musings-v0), I muse on a variety
of topics.  I mention most of those topics in passing in that musing.
While I was drafting this musing, I started to write a longer description
of each category of musing.  I got as far as the third paragraph about
one topic.  Then I realized that the goal was a comparatively brief
introduction [1].  So I moved them to a separate musing.

* Since I'm a curmudgeon, I post [**rants**](index-rants) about a variety
  of issues.  Most frequently, I rant about campus policies (or changes
  to those policies), but I also complain about bad software, non-inclusive
  practices, and a variety of other issues.  Some rants speak most
  clearly to folks at Grinnell or people in academia.  Others seem to
  appeal to a broader audience.  And, after all, this is the age of the
  InterWeb.  Watching people complain is part of the experience.
* Teaching is part of my identity.  Hence, I write a bit on the [**experience
  and practice of teaching**](index-teaching).  These include reflections
  on practices and techniques, drafts of teaching materials, and the
  occasional commentary on what happened when I use the materials.  I
  also write regularly about assessment; some of those musings end up
  being classified as being about teaching, others seem to be rants.
  Colleagues and students seem to appreciate the general musings about
  teaching.  A few computer scientists seem to appreciate the musings
  that focus on teaching computer science.
* I write about [**Grinnell College**](index-grinnell) and about [**a variety
  of people associated with the College**](index-grinnellians).  Some
  of those musings are intended as resources for prospective students,
  prospective parents, prospective faculty, or prospective staff.  Most
  reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of this institution I love.

[1] Well, comparatively brief for me.

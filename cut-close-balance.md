Cut, close, balance
===================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), rambly, things I thought I'd written*

As I've mentioned previously, Grinnell has an "interesting" registration
system for returning students: During an eleven-day period in the prior
semester that we call *preregistration*, students and their advisors agree
upon the courses that students would prefer to take the next semester
and then the students "register" for those courses.  Unlike some schools,
which employ a "first-come, first-served" process, we allow all interested
students to register for courses, even if there are many many more people
registered for a course than the course can handle [1].

What happens next?  A process that we call the *cut, close, balance
process*.  That is, we have to figure out how to deal with over-enrolled
courses and some other situations.  The process involves decisions,
negotiations, and actions by individual faculty members, by departments,
by the Registrar's office, and even by the Dean.  Let's see if I can
get the process down.

We'll start with what may be the simplest process: balancing.  When there
are multiple sections of the same course, a department may ask the
Registrar's office to balance those sections.  There are many reasons to
balance sections.  Balancing levels out faculty workload and, in doing
so, gives students similar experiences [2].  That's not to say that
balancing is necessarily fair.  I've heard someone note that "Students
pay a lot to attend Grinnell; if there's room in a section, they should
be able to take classes at the time they want, with the faculty members
they want [3]." In balancing sections, the Registrar's office only pays
attention to other courses, so students may be "balanced" into a time that
conflicts with work or athletic obligations [4].  Some clever students
avoid that case by putting a "dummy" course, such as a half-credit PE
course, in the other slot [5].

What about over-enrolled courses that don't have another section, or those
in which the total enrollment across sections exceeds the total capacity?
That's when things get complicated.

In some cases, cutting becomes the decision of an individual faculty
member.  They may ask students for their rationales for taking the course.
They may look at the major of students, preserving students who likely
need the course for the major.  They can also ask the Registrar's office
to randomly cut students from the course.  Some faculty members may also
choose to allow their course to over-enroll by a few students [6,7].

In departments with limited class slots, cutting may end up being more
of a department decision.  For example, if all the 300-level courses are
over-enrolled, a department may start by looking at all of the 300-level
enrollments to make sure that all majors get at least one 300-level
course; it seems more appropriate to cut a student with two 300-level
courses from one of those courses than to cut a student with only one
300-level courses.  Departments might also look at broader issues, such
as the total number of courses a student has taken in the department,
or whether there are courses with open slots that could meet the same
requirement.  Econ avoids this issue in its seminars by having a
pre-preregistration process that assigns Econ majors to seminars.

At times, a department may be able to look at its preregistration numbers
and find a way to cancel or combine courses with lower enrollments to
free up a faculty member to teach another section of an over-enrolled
course.  Those changes can often involve multiple steps.  For example,
we might combine sections 1 and 2 of course 1, freeing instructor A to
teach instructor B's section of course 2, which frees instructor B to
teach another section of course 3, which was over-enrolled.

There's also an informal process for adding sections.  If a department
has a faculty member on an contract, such as a senior lecturer or
someone in a shared position, the department can ask the Dean to pay
for another section.  Similarly, if a department can quickly identify
someone willing to teach a single course, the department can ask the
Dean to pay for another section.  There are also some variants of
these processes, including some with no cost that still require
Deanly approval [8].  

All of this has to happen relatively quickly.  We get the class lists
on Friday morning.  Our changes are due by the following Wednesday.
That's not a lot of time, particularly if one has to negotiate with the
Dean [9].  The Registrar's office then has a little more than a week
to do all of the work (e.g., balancing sections).  Students then get
notified of the changes and, if necessary, meet with their advisors to
work out alternatives to the courses from which they were cut.

I've mentioned balancing and cutting.  What about "close"?  Courses from
which we cut students are marked as "closed".  That means that no one else
can register for them, even if someone drops the course.  I believe that
courses with only a few open slots also get marked as "closed".  That way,
when we reach the followup process, faculty have some control over who
gets the few remaining slots in those courses.

It's not an ideal process.  For example, students who get cut from a
course in the CCB [10] process generally have a much more limited range of
classes to select afterwards.  And there are some ways to manipulate the
system [11].  But it seems like a fairer process than, say, first-come,
first-served, which is affected by everything from advisor availability
to financial circumstances.

What happens when a course has a particularly low enrollment during
preregistration?   That's not an issue I've ever encountered in my
courses [14], but I know it happens.  I've heard that the Dean generally
asks departments to cancel courses that have an enrollment of fewer
than six students, unless those courses are required for the major.
But I don't know what those faculty members are asked to teach instead.
I guess if it's a low-enrolled fall course, they could be asked to
teach an additional spring course.  But they can't necessarily teach
another section of a high-enrollment course in the same department.
For example, if, for some reason, we had too-low enrollment in CSC-207,
there's no way that I could teach a section of our over-enrolled CSC-213.
I guess some shifting might be possible ("You teach a section of intro,
which frees someone else to teach the needed course"), but that seems
both complicated and anger-inducing.  Plus, when I look at the subjects
of some of those courses [15], it strikes me that they should be more
popular, and possibly will be once students are cut from other courses.
Cutting courses sounds complicated.  I'm glad I'm not Dean.

[1] See, for example, the fifty-six people enrolled in section 2 of
ART-111, _Introduction to the Studio_, which has a cap of fifteen.

[2] If we did not balance sections, a student in a low-enrollment
section would likely get more individual attention than a student in a
high-enrollment section.

[3] This comment does not apply when we balance students out of 
over-enrolled sections.

[4] I've heard rumor of an athlete who got balanced into a Friday
afternoon lab, creating multiple conflicts.

[5] I don't recommend this practice.  I just report.

[6] We try to choose course caps that are appropriate for subject and
structure of the course, so over-enrolling should be a rare option.

[7] Our Chemistry department is notable for its willingness to allow
courses to over-enroll to meet demand.  And I recently saw data that
suggests that I've allowed my sections of CSC-151 to over-enroll so much
that the average enrollment in the course is higher than the capacity
of the course.

[8] For example, one year in which I was chair, I had a faculty member
willing to teach an extra section of an over-enrolled two-credit course
with the understanding that they would only teach a 4.5-course teaching
load the following year.

[9] I recall one particularly harrowing year in which I made an early
request to the Dean but did not hear back until 4 p.m. on Wednesday.

[10] cut, close, balance

[11] I've already mentioned the strategy of putting a placeholder course
in to prevent being switched to another section.  Some students will also
enroll in two high-demand courses to increase their odds in getting into
at least one.  The latter strategy means that demand may appear higher 
than it is.  For example, suppose thirty students wanted either 
Underwater Basket Weaving or Clap for Credit [12], but not both, and
that each has a capacity of fifteen students.  If all students followed
the strategy, then it would appear that the demand for each course is
such that it requires a second section, even though we could make do
with only one section of each.  In spite of this problem, I understand
why students use this strategy; if they enroll only in Underwater Basket
Weaving and get cut, it may seems like no slots will be available in
Clap for Credit.

[12] Both are traditional fictional classes

[14] CSC-326 often under-enrolls.  But since it's a two-credit course
with a cap of six that accrues no teaching credit, it's in a separate
situation than most courses.

[15] No, I will not identify particular low-enrollment courses.

Cut, close, balance
===================

*Topics/tags: [Registration](index-registration), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), rambly, things I thought I'd written*

As I've mentioned previously, Grinnell has an atypical registration
system for returning students: During an eleven-day period in the prior
semester that we call *preregistration*, students and their advisors agree
upon the courses that students would prefer to take the next semester
and then the students "register" for those courses.  Unlike some schools,
which employ a "first-come, first-served" process, or variants thereof,
we allow all interested students to register for courses, even if there
are many many more people registered for a course than the course can
handle [1].

What happens next?  Something we call the *cut, close, balance process*.
That is, we have to figure out how to deal with over-enrolled courses and
some other situations.  The process involves decisions, negotiations, and
actions by individual faculty members, by departments, by the Registrar's
office, and even by the Dean.  Let's see if I can get the process down.

We'll start with what may be the simplest part of the process: balancing.
When there are multiple sections of the same course, a department may
ask the Registrar's office to balance those sections.  There are many
reasons to balance sections.  Balancing levels out faculty workload
and, in doing so, gives students similar experiences [2].  That's not
to say that balancing is necessarily fair.  I've heard someone note that
"Students pay a lot to attend Grinnell; if there's room in a section, they
should be able to take classes at the time they want, with the faculty
members they want [3,4]." In balancing sections, the Registrar's office
only pays attention to other courses, so students may be "balanced"
into a time that conflicts with work, athletic, or other obligations
[5].  Some clever students avoid that case by putting a "placeholder",
such as a half-credit PE course, in the other slot [6].

What about over-enrolled courses that don't have another section,
or those in which the total enrollment across sections exceeds the
combined capacity?  That's when things get complicated.

In some cases, cutting becomes the decision of an individual faculty
member.  They may ask students for their rationales for taking the
course.  They may look at the major of students, preserving students
who likely need the course for the major.  They may prioritize seniors,
who will not get another chance to take the course [7].  They may
prioritize prospective majors or concentrators.  If there's still work
to do after that, or if they want the cuts to be "fair", they can also
ask the Registrar's office to randomly cut students from the course.
Some faculty members may also choose to allow their course to over-enroll
by a few students [8,9].

In departments with limited class slots, cutting may end up being more
of a departmental decision.  For example, if all the 300-level courses are
over-enrolled, a department may start by looking at all of the 300-level
enrollments to make sure that all majors get at least one 300-level
course; it seems more appropriate to cut a student with two 300-level
courses from one of those courses than to cut a student with only one
300-level course.  Departments might also look at broader issues, such
as the total number of courses a student has taken in the department,
or whether there are courses with open slots that could meet the same
requirement.  Econ avoids this issue in its seminars by having a
pre-preregistration process that assigns Econ majors to seminars.

At times, a department may be able to look at its preregistration numbers
and find a way to cancel or combine courses with lower enrollments to
free up a faculty member to teach another section of an over-enrolled
course.  Those changes can often involve multiple steps.  For example,
we might combine sections 1 and 2 of course 1, freeing instructor A to
teach instructor B's section of course 2, which frees instructor B to
teach another section of course 3, which was over-enrolled.

There's also an informal process for adding sections.  If a department has
a faculty member on an expandable contract, such as a senior lecturer or
someone in a shared position, the department can ask the Dean to pay for
another section.  Similarly, if a department can quickly identify someone
willing to teach a single course, the department can ask the Dean to pay
for another section.  There are also some variants of these processes,
including some with no cost that still require Deanly approval [10].

All of this has to happen relatively quickly.  We get the class lists
on Friday morning.  Our changes are due by the following Wednesday.
That's not a lot of time, particularly if one has to negotiate with the
Dean [11].  The Registrar's office then has a little more than a week
to do all of the work (e.g., balancing sections).  Students then get
notified of the changes and, if necessary, meet with their advisors to
work out alternatives to the courses from which they were cut.

I've mentioned balancing and cutting.  What about "close"?  Courses from
which we cut students are marked as "closed".  That means that no one else
can register for them, even if someone drops the course.  I believe that
courses with only a few open slots also get marked as "closed".  That way,
when we reach the followup process, faculty have some control over who
gets the few remaining slots in those courses.

CCB [12] is not an ideal process.  For example, students who get cut from a
course in the CCB process generally have a much more limited range of
classes to select afterwards.  And there are some ways to manipulate the
system [14].  But it seems like a fairer process than, say, first-come,
first-served, which is affected by everything from advisor availability
to financial circumstances.

---

There's another side to the CCB process; handling low-enrollment classes.
What happens when a course has an especially low enrollment during
preregistration?   That's not an issue I've ever encountered in my
courses [16], but I know it happens.  I've heard that the Dean generally
asks departments to cancel courses that have an enrollment of fewer
than six students, unless those courses are required for the major.
But I don't know what those faculty members are asked to teach instead.
I guess if it's a low-enrolled fall course, they could be asked to
teach an additional spring course.  But they can't necessarily teach
another section of a high-enrollment course in the same department.
For example, if, for some reason, we had too-low enrollment in CSC-207,
there's no way that I could teach a section of our over-enrolled CSC-213.
I guess some shifting might be possible ("You teach a section of intro,
which frees someone else to teach the needed course"), but that seems
both complicated and anger-inducing.  Plus, when I look at the subjects
of some of those courses [17], it strikes me that they should be more
popular, and possibly will be once students are cut from other courses.
Cutting courses sounds complicated.  I'm glad I'm not Dean.

Postscript: I know some parents ask "When the demand for a course is
higher than the number of slots, why not just make the course larger?"
As a parent [18], I understand the desire for our students to be able
to take the courses they want.  But there are a lot of reasons to stick
to course caps.  One has to do with classroom space.  Many classes,
particularly lab-based classes, don't have physical room for more
students.  Another has to do with class structure.  A discussion-based
class will feel very different with twenty students than with sixteen.
Some disciplines, particularly languages, have caps that their
professional societies recommend.  Faculty members have limited time for
meeting with students individually and for providing feedback; a larger
class means less feedback per student.  We also don't want our faculty
members to burn out.  Larger classes put more demand, and unequal demand,
on the faculty who teach them.  So, although we hate to cut students
from classes, it's necessary.

[1] See, for example, the fifty-six people enrolled in section 2 of
ART-111, _Introduction to the Studio_, which has a cap of fifteen.

[2] If we did not balance sections, a student in a low-enrollment
section would likely get more individual attention than a student in a
high-enrollment section.

[3] In courses like BIO-150 and ENG-120, which have different topics
for different sections, students should also be able to pick the topic.

[4] This comment does not apply when we balance students out of 
over-enrolled sections.

[5] I've heard rumor of an athlete who got balanced into a Friday
afternoon lab, creating multiple conflicts.

[6] I don't recommend this practice.  I just report. 

[7] For courses that are offered every-other year, third-year students
are also unlikely to take the course.

[8] We try to choose course caps that are appropriate for the subject and
the structure of the course, so over-enrolling should be a rare option,
one that we realize may compromise course quality.

[9] Our Chemistry department is notable for its willingness to allow
courses to over-enroll to meet demand.  And I recently saw data that
suggests that I've allowed my sections of CSC-151 to over-enroll so much
that the average enrollment in the course is higher than the capacity
of the course.

[10] For example, one year in which I was chair, I had a faculty member
willing to teach an extra section of an over-enrolled two-credit course
with the understanding that they would only teach a 4.5-course teaching
load the following year.

[11] I recall one particularly harrowing year in which I made an early
request to the Dean but did not hear back until 4 p.m. on Wednesday.

[12] cut, close, balance

[14] I've already mentioned the strategy of putting a placeholder course
in to prevent being switched to another section.  Some students will also
enroll in two high-demand courses to increase their odds in getting into
at least one.  The latter strategy means that demand may appear higher 
than it is.  For example, suppose thirty students wanted either 
Underwater Basket Weaving or Clap for Credit [15], but not both, and
that each has a capacity of fifteen students.  If all students followed
the strategy, then it would appear that the demand for each course is
such that it requires a second section, even though we could make do
with only one section of each.  In spite of this problem, I understand
why students use this strategy; if they enroll only in Underwater Basket
Weaving and get cut, it may seem like no slots will be available in
Clap for Credit.

[15] Both are traditional fictional classes

[16] CSC-326 often under-enrolls.  But since it's a two-credit course
with a cap of six that accrues no teaching credit, it's in a separate
situation than most courses.

[17] No, I will not identify particular low-enrollment courses.

[18] And as an advisor.

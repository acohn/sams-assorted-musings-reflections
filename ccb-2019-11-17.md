Cuts, Closes, and Balances in CS for Spring 2020
================================================

*Topics/tags: [Registration](index-registration), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), long*

As [I've written previously](cut-close-balance), Grinnell deals
with registration for returning students in a strange, but somewhat
sensible way: We don't cap the number of students who register for
a class, but we do reduce classes to capacity (or slightly above
capacity) after students register.  The system seems fairer than
most I've seen, although it does involve some extra work for faculty
and the staff of the Registrar's office.

This year, I thought I'd share the current situation in CS and
some of the ways we might approach that situation.  We haven't met
yet to discuss our exact strategies, and the enrollment data [are
public](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/), so
it seems acceptable to treat this as a theoretical exercise, albeit
one with practical, and sometimes painful, implications.

Where do things stand after the open registration [1,2]?  Here are
the data I found.

At first glance, it may not seem too bad to you.  While we have
some classes that are over capacity (eleven, if I count correctly),
only one has double-digits of over-enrollment and we also have a
bunch of courses with open slots (nine, if I count correctly).  But
let's look at some details and reflect on how we might deal with the
over-enrollment issues.

CSC-105 only has eight students enrolled.  That's certainly enough to
warrant offering the class.  There are two other reasons I can think of
to continue to offer the class [5].  First, since TEC-154, Evolution
of Technology, is not being offered this year, the Technology Studies
concentration is allowing Tech Studies concentrators to count CSC-105 
in its stead.  I don't know if we have any concentrators in the course.
However, if we do, we should not eliminate it.  Second, if we look at
the historical data, CSC-105 grows in enrollment when we offer it
annually; it's a great course, but students need to hear about it from
other students.

Two sections of CSC-151 are over-enrolled.  But there's enough space
in the other section to accommodate those students.  We will balance
the sections.  I'm pleased to see that six sections of 151 per year,
with a bit of over-enrollment in the fall, seems to be meeting
current demand.

CSC-161 is a problem.  We have twenty more students enrolled than we
would typically allow.  

What are our options?

Some members of the department [6] would likely allow each section
to grow by another ten students.  But that's not necessarily fair
to the students.  Larger classes mean less personal attention in
class, more demand for office hours, and, likely, less feedback on
exams and assignments.  It's also a burden on the faculty member
teaching those courses [7].  

We could cut some large number of students from the course.  That
seems like a bad idea.  Many of the students taking CSC-161 are
doing so because they want to continue in the CS major.  Unless the
College is willing to decide that students may not get the major
they want because of space issues, rather than interest or talent,
we should not close students out [8].  Arguably, these students
could continue their major even if we made them wait until the fall
to take the second course.  However, that doesn't feel very good.
Are there students other than prospective majors in CSC-161?  I
hope so.  It's good for students to take more CS.  It's also the
case that many students need more CS for their other studies.  So
cutting seems to be a bad option.

We could cancel another course and add another section of CSC-161.
The only course with comparatively low enrollments is CSC-105.  And,
as I mentioned, not only are eight students generally enough to
warrant offering a course, but there are other good reasons to offer
this particular course.  You might suggest cutting CSC-326, which has
low enrollments.  However, CSC-326 carries no teaching credit, so
cutting those sections has no real effect.  I'll write a bit more on 
CSC-326 when we get to CSC-324.

When Mike Latham was Dean, he would often suggest that we just hire
a graduate student from a nearby institution.  But our nearby institutions
are not that near; each is about sixty miles away.  It's also pretty clear
in our conversations with both UIowa and Iowa State that any grad
students they have who are able to teach are already teaching at their
home institution.

I could give up the second half of my sabbatical and teach the
course (and, presumably, another course or courses) [9].  But I've
given up too much of my sabbatical in the past.  And it's pretty
clear I continue to need sabbatical for my well being.  It also
means that the College will have to give me the half-semester
sabbatical in the near future.

We could try to convince Henry Walker to come back and teach the
course.  I'm not sure if Henry already has another obligation for
the spring.  I'm not sure that he'd be willing to spend another
semester in Grinnell, rather than with his family.  And then there's
the question of how much he should be compensated [10].

We could try to find another faculty member to teach CSC-105, thereby
freeing the person teaching 105 to teach a section of CSC-161 [11].
But there aren't many people on campus who could teach 105 or who
would want to teach 105.  If I recall correctly, the ones I know
of are all on sabbatical this year.

We could try to get someone from Math/Stats to teach CSC-208, freeing
someone to teach another section of CSC-161.  But [Math/Stats is in
as bad shape as we are](prereg-2020S).  I'm pretty sure they can't
spare any of the faculty who could teach 208.  As importantly, the
person teaching 208 this semester has a research project closely tied
to the content of the course; it seems unfair to pull them out of the
course.

We could ask a faculty member to teach an overload; a sixth course
for the year.  I know that Math/Stats has made that decision from
time to time.  But I wouldn't want to ask an untenured faculty member
to take on that extra work (and, in any case, all of our untenured
faculty are teaching at least 2.5 courses this spring or are on
sabbatical).  I also wouldn't want to ask a senior faculty member
to take on extra work.  Some might volunteer, but it should be their
choice.

I'm interested to see what we'll decide at Monday's department meeting.
What would you do?

We've made it through three courses so far.  On to the 200-level courses.
We'll balance the two sections of CSC-207.  That's not ideal for the students
who wanted the afternoon section.  But they'll get the same faculty member,
and everyone is better off with equivalent size classes.  We don't need
to do anything with CSC-208. That's comforting.

What about CSC-213, Operating Systems, and CSC-261, Artificial
Intelligence.  CSC-213 is a required course [12], so we don't want
to cut too many students from it, or at least not too many prospective
CS majors.  While it's also good to serve people who are not
necessarily CS majors, particularly those who might be taking the course
for another reason, we do have to prioritize current and prospective
CS majors.  And it's a lab-based course.  we really do need to cap
it at 24.  What will we do about the seven extra students?  I expect
that we will start by cutting students who will have another chance
to take the course and who are enrolled in multiple CS courses this
semester.  That's a strategy that many of our peers now employ [14].
I know from conversations with other advisors that there are some
students who are trying to take three CS courses this semester.  I
generally discourage that choice, and I expect that, given our
limited resources, that's a cut we'll naturally make.

Let's turn to CSC 261.  Even though it's an elective, AI is an
increasingly important topic for CS majors [16].  There are even
some CS faculty [17] who think Machine Learning should be taught
to every undergraduate CS major.  I wouldn't go that far, but I
expect that we'll have some discussions about that issue over the
next few years.

There's only one section, so it's really the instructor's choice
as to who they will cut.  But we usually do the cuts for individual
courses in the context of broader cuts.  Since it's a research-heavy,
projects-based class, I don't think we can teach it to more than
24.  That means we'll have to cut eight students.  Again, it will
be easier to cut non-majors and students taking multiple CS courses
who will have another opportunity to take the course.  However, 261
is offered every-other year, so there are fewer students who fall
into that category.  There's also some benefit to the faculty member
in taking younger students, who can then better contribute to summer
research projects.  In any case, it's conceptually hard to cut
students from AI and it won't be a fun task.

On the subject of electives, I'm happy to see that the new course
on HCI and Programming has solid enrollment.  It's really a cool
topic, which I understand to be on the order of "let's apply HCI
principles to the design of programming languages".  There are three
more students in the class than the cap.  Is 20 a low cap?  Not for
a 300-level special-topics course.  For the other nineteen courses
with a 395 designation, I see only one other with a cap of 20, as
well as thirteen with a cap of 15, one with a cap of 14, three with
a cap of 12, and one with a cap of 10.  As much as I hate to say
it, I think cutting three is the right approach, especially since
the instructor is in a three-course semester.  I'm also starting
to wonder whether we should follow the lead of most other departments
and cap our special topics courses at 15.

I'm surprised that there are slots in CSC-301, Analysis of Algorithms,
and CSC-341, Automata, Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity.
Both are required for the major.  But both also have a significant
math prerequisite.  It may be that timing has worked out so that
not many students have that prerequisite.  It may be that some are
considering taking an equivalent course abroad [18].

What's left?  Just our software design courses.  A few years ago,
when Dean Latham encouraged us to combine our two-credit software
design courses into a four-credit course (CSC-324), we made the
choice to add an uncompensated extra two-credit course (CSC-326)
for students who wanted to do another semester of software design
[19].  The two courses are offered at overlapping times, and the
students in the two courses work together on projects, so it makes
some sense that 326 is uncompensated.  The goal is that we have
twenty students per section between 324 and 326.  A class of twenty students
permits four teams of five, which is what I think we've decided works
well [20].  Where do we stand?  We have twenty-seven in one section
and twenty-three in another.  Do we cut ten students?  Do we balance
and teach overloads of twenty-five in each section?  The latter
option is hard, since it means another project to manage in each
section.  There's a lot of overhead in adding a project, including finding
a client, deciding on an appropriate scope, recruiting an alumni mentor,
and more.  And, of course, another project requires more support during
the semester.  So what will we do?  I expect that we'll do some of
what we do in other courses: Cut people with multiple CS courses,
try to shift some to open slots in Algorithms or Theory, and so on
and so forth.

As you may have realized from this narrative, although some parts
of the cut, close, and balance process are relatively straightforward,
others are complex.  And, unfortunately, we are asked to balance
faculty wellness and teaching quality with opportunities for students
to take the courses they want.  A first-come, first-served process,
or any other process that stops as soon as a course reaches capacity,
would eliminate the need for us to explicitly consider that balance.
But I don't think the end result would be nearly as good as what
we have now.  

A "take all comers" solution would be another approach, but I think
it would be equally bad.  Adding to faculty workload and stress
would reduce the quality of instruction, as would the higher student/faculty
ratio.  Larger classes might also lead to faculty burnout, or at
least feelings of inequity.  In the long run, it would make it
harder to recruit and retain talented faculty.  It's not worth it.

I don't like the stress of making the cut, close, and balance
decisions, but I think Grinnell's registration strategy is one of
the better approaches out there.

Postscript: When the department meets to discuss these issues, we
bring in a variety of other sources of information.  We have
enrollment lists for each class in the department, which makes it
easier to identify students enrolling in multiple classes and the
likely major of the student.  Advisors usually bring in some
contextual information, such as the students' four-year plans or
knowledge about plans.  We also often have information about students
who are not our advisees.

---

[1] Formerly "preregistration".

[2] Since "open curriculum" has evolved to "individually advised
curriculum" [3], I wonder if "open registration" will soon evolve to
"individually advised registration".

[3] Or "individually advised learning", now that our marketing consultants
got a hold of it.

[4] Why do we abbreviate "Problem" as "Prob" in two courses and as
"Prblm" in a third?  I have no idea.  But we should probably replace
"Prblm Solvng" with "Prob Solving" in CSC 161.

[5] Other than "Let's not screw with the students who enrolled."

[6] Including me.

[7] "Teaching especially large classes" has been debated as a criterion
for getting higher scores on the teaching category in the salary rubric.
If I recall correctly, some faculty objected that they do not have the
opportunity to teach larger classes.  Nonetheless, large classes are a
burden and that burden should be acknowledged in some way.

[8] I mention this approach, in part, because at least one higher-ranked
peer essentially tells students "If you're not lucky enough to get
introductory CS in your first year, you won't be able to be a CS
major."

[9] Don't worry family, I'm not really planning that as an option.  I'm
just trying to suggest some of the things that we consider.

[10] Fortunately, that's a question for the Dean, not for us.

[11] You may wonder why I don't say "We could find another faculty member
to teach 161."  It's more likely that we could find someone to teach
105 than 161.

[12] More precisely, students need to take either CSC-213 or CSC-211.  But
we filled both sections of CSC-211 in the fall and, if I recall, had to
cut a few.

[14] In fact, at least one higher-ranked peer [15] has hard limits on the
number of CS courses majors can take and those limits are pretty close to
a minimal major.  We've done our best to avoid being at that point.

[15] Not the same one I mentioned in the prior end note.

[16] It's always been a somewhat important area.  But it's becoming
essential.  And it's certainly evolved significantly from when I took
it.

[17] Although not any I've heard from at Grinnell.

[18] We allow students to take one required upper-level course abroad,
as well as one elective.  CSC 301 and CSC 341 are the most common
candidates for the required upper-level course.

[19] An extra semester of software design was one of the strategies we
had suggested as our department's mechanism for ensuring that every
student had an opportunity to do research.

[20] It may be five teams of four.  I'm currently out of the loop.  But
what I recall is that our hope was that we'd have one team leader from
CSC-326 in each group and then four team members from CSC-324.

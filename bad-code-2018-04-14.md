Bad code

*Topic/tags: rants, the C programming language, program design*

Recently, the Registrar's office asked us to consider whether we'd accept
a standardized CS examination as a course equivalent, for general CS credit,
for generic science credit, or not at all.  The syllabus they sent us was
250 pages long, including a description of the curriculum, some sample
marked solutions, and some commentary from graders.

No, I did not read it all.  Instead, I jumped quickly to the sample
solutions.  Here's one of the first ones I found.

    int popStack(int stack[], int number)
            {
                    int value;
    /* Check for error situation first */
                    if (number < 1)
                            {
    printf("The stack is already emty");
                                    return -1;
                            }
                    else if (number > 99)
                            {
                    printf("Elements size is beyond the stack size);
                    return -1;
            }
            else /* Stack can be popped */
                    {
                            value = stack[number-1];
                            stack[number-1] = -99;
                            number = number -1;
                            return value;
                }
    }

How would you grade this?  Think for a minute.  If you know me, how do
you think I'd grade this?  Let's see what they said.

    int popStack(int stack[], int number)                   // 1 mark for data type of return value
            {                                               // 1 mark for passing array parameters
                    int value;                              // 1 mark for int parameter number
    /* Check for error situation first */
                    if (number < 1)                         // 1 mark for testing stacks empty
                            {
    printf("The stack is already emty");
                                    return -1;              // 1 mark for return message
                            }
                    else if (number > 99)
                            {
                    printf("Elements size is beyond the stack size);        // 1 mark for testing
                    return -1;                                              // 1 mark for message
            }
            else /* Stack can be popped */                  // 1 mark for assignment
                    {
                            value = stack[number-1];        // 1 mark for replacing value with -99
                            stack[number-1] = -99;
                            number = number -1;             // 1 mark for returning value
                            return value;
                    }
    }

No, I don't know why the comments on the marks don't quite correspond to
the line they are supposedly marking.

How would I respond to this piece of code?  With comments like the following.

* No documentation for the overall purpose or the meanings of the
  parameters.
* Formatting so bad that it makes the code unreadable. [2]
* Use of magic numbers like 99 and -99. [3]
* Violates the abstraction barrier by printing error messages directly
  to the user, rather than to the calling procedure. [4]
* Bad design: Reveal the index of the top of the stack (and thereby
  the underlying implementation) to the client. [6]
* Bad design: 1-based indexing for the top even though C is a language
  with zero-based indexing. [7]
* Bad naming: The parameter that represents the top of the stack is 
  called `number`.
* Spelling error: "empty". [8]

Then there's that whole `number = number -1;` line.  I don't know what
to do with it.  It suggests to me that the programmer really doesn't
understand C.  I *think* they're trying to change the top of the stack.
But C is a call-by-value language, changing `number` only has an effect
in this procedure; it does not change whatever variable caller had. Since
they don't use `number` afterwards, the line is pointless.  We could give
it a point by making `number` (well, `top`, as it should be called),
a pointer.  Then the programmer would write `*top = *top - 1;` or,
better yet, `*top -= 1;`

If a student gave me this code on a final exam, I would have reservations
about passing them in the class, no matter how they had done the rest
of the semester.  I would not want to impose someone who writes code
like this on another faculty member, let alone a team of fellow
programmers.

I bet you can tell how I'm going to vote on how (or whether) we should
count this exam.

[1] I realize that they may have been given the documentation in a prompt.
As far as I can tell, that prompt was not made available ot me.  Even if
I gave students summary documentation in a prompt, I'd expect them to 
restate it in their answer.  Code needs documentation.

[2] Beginning students screw up formatting.  By the end a course, they
should not.  And this formatting is really atrocious.  It took me a minute
or more to figure out that the right brace before the final `else`
did not match the left brace that started the procedure.

[3] Magic numbers are one of the most basic of "code smells".  They make
code harder to read and harder to maintain.  It's really easy to define
constants.

[4] Not everyone understands this principle; perhaps I should be generous.
But I really do believe that utility code should only communicate with
its client and not with the user.  How would you feel if every time a
library routine failed, it printed something on the screen?  [5]

[5] Oh, wait, Windows used to do that.

[6] Ideally, we'd 

[7] Either you assume a client who understands the details or you don't.
This code mixes the two assumptions poorly.

[8] I wouldn't really take off for that issue.

Potential forthcoming musings
=============================

_This is my online "sketchbook" for the musings I hope to someday write.
It's not really intended for public consumption, but I won't object if
you find it and decide to read it._

Notes for the next end of month musing
--------------------------------------

* Fewer goals.  Rant a bit.  Maybe write about some Grinnellians.  Still
  have the long-standing goal of reading _Style_.  Added Ralph's book
  and Eric's book.  Plus _Friday Black_
* Fun coinkydink.  Both middle and I wrote about NaNoWriMo on the same
  day, although with different conclusions.
* Started a new sketchbook.  (Led to at least two musings.)
* Extra musings to clear out the backlog?
* Reached another milestone (800 musings).
* A few double days after a few missing days.  Did it balance?
* Misnumbered at least once.  Fixed later.
* A few images.  Pogo strip.  My odometer.  Way too many things from the
  pioneers.grinnell.edu Web site.

On particular dates
-------------------

* November 30, 2018: End-of-month musing. 
* Ground-hog's day, 2019: Ground hog's day.  How long has it been since
  we've had one of those parties?  Don't really serve ground hog.
* March 29, 2019: outliving my father.  (It's a facebook memory from
  that date in 2013.)
* Mother's day, 2019.  Kathy.
* Father's day, 2019.  Dad or Lloyd.
* November 1, 2019: NaNoWriMo (On writing.)  
* November 11, 2019: Veterans Day (the Tom Russell song)

Categorized musings
-------------------

_This section represents my attempt to categorize the musings a bit.
Musings may have multiple categories.  After the title, you'll find the
topics surrounded by parentheses._

_**Tags/form or meta**:`_ anyway (as in "things I was writing anyway"), article (based on an article I've read), delayed, draft, long, rambly (I've used that in released musings, but not in the sektchbook), request, revisit, short, sketch_

_**Tags/style**:`_ rants, talks, memos, oer_

_**Tags/content**:`_ accessibility, autobiographical, CSC 151, data science, delayed, digital humanities (or dighum), email, grinnell, joc, language, meta, obermann, overcommittment, packrat, Racket (or Scheme; I'm not consistent), technical (not the same as technology), technology (not the same as technical), writing_

1. Grinnellians: Henry Haven Windsor _`:grinnellians:`_

1. Revising the FunDHum schedule. _`:csc151:draft:`_ (`fundhum-schedule-01`)

1. Obermann: Fantasy vs. Reality.  _`:autobiographical:sketch:`_ (`obermann-fantasy-vs-reality`)

1. Glenn Leggett's first article in _Teacher to Teacher_.  _`:writing:grinnell:rambly:`_

1. A proposal for that Mozilla ethics thing.  _`:department:compsci:anyway:`_
(Probably too late.)

1. Something about the evaluation reading.  _`:writing:csc151:sketch:`_
Unstuck, but slow.  (Probably expected it in this case.)  Combining two
readings.  New approach. Previously combined parser and evaluator.
That was probably a bad idea, so I'm mostly rewriting from scratch.
Still frustrated by Scribble.  How do I customize the LaTeX easily?
(How do I get output in .tex but not .html?  Hack: .css hides it.).
Why did I choose to use it?  How much did I write in one eight-hour day?
From about 1.5 pages, 108 lines, 551 words, to about 10 pages, 590 lines,
3651 words.  A very hard reading to write.

1. Understanding the HSSC.  _`:rants:rant retractions:short:`_
At some point last year, I complained about the size and cost of the
HSSC.  But I'm coming ot understand its implicit value.  At a time
in which many schools are de-emphasizing the humanities, Grinnell is
explicitly doubling down on the humanities "We value these areas enough to
build a ginormous complex devoted to them."

1. The Pyramid.  _`:autobiographical:technical:request:short:`_
When I started College in 1982 I had two primary computing options:
terminal to our TOPS-20 system and a terminal to our Amdahl, which I
used to refer to as "the world's largest IBM clone".  There were probably
PC's around, too, but ....  Pyramid issues: Gosling Emacs.  Pascal compiler.
Joan's class.

1. Valuing the MathLAN Web server. _`:rants:technology:draft:`_ (`mathlan-web-servers`)

1. Broken record.  _`:language:short:sketch:`_
Recently, I was drafting yet another musing about the state of
the Web at Grinnell.   

1. Phishing scams.  _misc:technology:short_ (`sextortion`)

1. Recording faculty legislation.  _`:grinnell:academia:`_ The faculty
regularly votes on things at faculty meetings.  I gave some sasmples in
[my history of end-of-course evaluations](eoce-history).  Some votes
get recorded as changes to the faculty handbook.  Those votes are usually
explicit votes to update the handbook.  What about the other policy
votes?  I guess I had assumed that the Dean's office kept a running
list.  But it turns out that that's not the case.  As far as I can tell,
the [faculty meeting minutes](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Faculty_Meetings/Forms/Mtg_Materials.aspx) and faculty memories are our main
way of keeping track of such decision.  That may have worked when we had
a Dean who came from the faculty (and, typically, had served leadership
roles on the faculty).  But Deans hired from the outside [lack both
historical and contextual knowledge](mastering-grinnell).  It's probably
time to put infrastructure in place to record decisions and make them
easy to find.  Hmmm ... that could be a project for a future section
of FunDHum.

1. Mourn what you lost or celebrate what you had.  _`:autobiographical:sketches:`_ (`mourn-or-celebrate`)

1. Ranking candidates.  _`:academia:sketch:`_ (`candidate-criteria`)
We've been told by the Dean's office that only do we have to have a fixed set of criteria for evaluating candidates, we also need to "rank" those criteria.  I think the idea of ranking criteria is absurd.  What happened to the idea of "holistic review", which we seem to be expected to do in so many other situations?  How do we compare someone who is strong on the top criterion but weak on the next two to someone who is weak on the top criterion but strong on the next two?

1. Refusing to recommend.  _`:recommendations:academia:sketch:`_ (`recommendation-bds`)

1. Outrage amplification.  _`:misc:language:short:sketch:`_
As I was writing a musing about [a faculty member's refusal to recommend someone because they were applying for an internship in Israel](recommendation-bds), I decided to come up with an acronym to describe what happens on the InterWeb.  It seemed that a variant of LASER (Light Amplification) that focused on Outrage Amplification seemed like the right way to go.  I started with
Outrage Amplification by Internet Expansion of Umbrage (OAIEU).  Then
I started to ask myself whether I should try to get the vowels in the
right order (AEIOU).  But I failed.  So I went back to thinking about something
closer to LASER.  Let's see ... if I want the third letter to be "S", that
could be "Stupid".  I do want to include "Internet", so I'll use an I rather
than E.  What about the "R"?  It could be reification (the way the InterWeb
makes things "real") or "reflection".  Yeah, that's better.  So Outrage
Amplification by Stupid Internet Reflection, or OASIR.  And no, that
was not intentional [1].
[1] OASIR is also Grinnell's Office of Analytic Support and Institutiona
Research.

1. Liberal arts at Ursinus.  _`:misc:academia:liberal arts:`_
<https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/10/15/college-doubles-down-its-residential-liberal-arts-mission-new-core-curriculum>

1. Beautiful Racket.  _`:joc:scheme:`_

1. A space to study.  _`:autobiographical:sketch:`_
Looking back from Obermann and ahead to my sabbatical.  What worked well
about the Obermann space and what will help me be more productive in my
next sabbatical?  (I have some notes sketched in the Google notebook.)

1. Early grad requirements. _`:grinnell:rants:draft:`_ (`early-grad-language`)

1. Going beyond text in the digital humanities _`:csc151:teaching:dighum:`_
When I posted my draft introduction to the new "digital humanities" CSC
151, some of the first responses I got were that the plans seemed a bit
text-centric.  As I get started, I should think about those isseus.
This is a tool building class more than a tool use class.  Easier to
get students quickly up to speed on algorithms in the context of text
than the context of, say, visualizations or animations.  Those take much
more time to develop and, frequently, require or reveal less sophisticated
algorithmic thinking.  Also issues of accessibility.  Text is generally
accessible to a broader range.  Most computers can read text aloud.
(Their ability to read program code aloud varies.)  Intracting with
text does not require a sophisticated interface or even a particular interface.
At the same time, I should be helping students think more broadly about
the digital humanities.

1. Jekyll or Scribble or ...?  _`:dighum:sketch:teaching:`_ (`jekyll-scribble-or.md`)

1. Revising the MediaScheme 151.  _`:teaching:csc151:mediascheme:sketch:`_ (`revising-mediascheme-151`)

1. My bookshelf at the Obermann center.  _`:autobiographical:obermann:rambly:sketch:dighum:`_ (`obermann-bookshelves`)

1. From Markdown.pl to pandoc.  _`:meta:joc:sketch:`_  (`markdown-pandoc.md`)
Switching the way in which I generate these musings.

1. The Academic Job Search.  _`:academia:articles:`_
<http://academicjobs.wikia.com/wiki/Academic_Jobs_Wiki>
<https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Way-We-Hire-Now/244467>

1. Playing with Google maps in Racket. _`:dighum:racket:`_

1. Creating a syllabus.  _`:dighum:academia:articles:`_
<https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/advice-syllabus>

1. The joy of code: Finding files.  _`:joc:sketch:`_
Recently, I've found a need to look for files somewhere in a subdirectory
using regular expressions.  I'm not sure why, but I found that `find`
did not work as I was expecting, probably because it uses bash regular
expressions rather than the regular expressions common in most other
languages.  (E.g., `a*` means "zero or more copies of 'a'" in most
regexp languages, but "a followed by any number of other characters"
in bash regexp.  Rather than figuring out the right way to express the
patterns to bash, I decideed to write my own utility.

1. The joy of code: Building syllabi tables.  _`:joc:dighum:teaching:`_
Recently, I found myself needed to explore the ordering of topics
in the schedule of a class.  Blah blah blah.

1. The joy of code: Inserting commands into markdown.  _`:joc:sketch:`_
I use Markdown for way too much of my work.  The other day, as I was
inserting the output of some shell command into my markdown file
(I think it was a command to build an HTML table that represents
a class schedule from an easier-to-manipulate text file), I realized
that it would make much more sense to insert that output programmatically,
rather than manually.  That way, if I change the way the command works,
I don't have to manually re-run the command.  Here's the core of
my solution, in Perl: `$contents =~ s/^!!(.*)$/process($1)/me;` Basically,
I replace any line that starts with two bangs (`!!`) with the result
of the command that appears after the two bangs.  `process` is just a
subroutine that evaluates the command and combines the output.  I love
writing code.  You can find the complete program at
<https://github.com/rebelsky/samr-utils/blob/master/mdexec>
Does Pandoc have a way to do that?  Potentially.  But it was more fun
to write my own solution.

1. The value of "things".  _`:authobiographical:sketch:packrat:`_
(The start of a new series on being a packrat.)
Michelle and I argue about stuff.  A lot.
Anyone who knows me knows that I accumulate.  I accumulate for a
variety of reasons.  But one reason that I accumulate is that I
assign meaning to things.  That Willa Cather book?  I bought it for
my mother.  And, even though mom eventually learned enough about Cather's
anti-semitism that she could no longer stomach reading Cather, I still
think about the shelf of Willa Cather books on the landing at home and
about the joy of finding a new one for her.  That Willa Cather book that
mom never even owned, but wasn't in her collection?  Same thing.  The
object ties me to my mother [1].  That old issue of _Scientific American_
that I'll probably never read.  It's one of the huge collection that
Salva Luria gave to me.  I needed to get rid of them when mom left
her house, I kept one issue [2] to remember the gift.
But the number of things I accumulate, particularly things
that I accumulate for other reasons, means that the special things also
get lost.  And so I'm always reluctant to throw something away, because
a special thing may be there, even if I'm not sure what the special
thing is.  Michelle says "Take a picture".  But a picture is not the
same as the item.
[1] Amazingly, even thinking about that issue makes me cry.
[2] Well, probably a half dozen issues.

1. Addication to accumulation. _`:autobiographical:sketches:`_ (`accumulation.md`)

1. Organization _`:autobiographical:organization:`_  (`organization.md`)
No one who sees my office and laba may believe this, but I really like
organization. Why aren't they neat? Addication to accumulation and
inability to get rid of things. 

1. Advising complexities _`:rants:grinnell:academia:`_
We have a new advising handbook.  I really appreciate the effort that
went into what should be a "one stop shop" for academic advisers
(or advisors).  And there are lots of great things.  Nonetheless,
as I read the handbook, I get reminded about frustrations as an
advisor and as a computer scientist. 
...
If the folks who are in charge can't get it right, how do they expect
the rest of us to?
Communication on campus.
DRY.  (Oh, yeah, that's why I'm frustated as a coputer scientist.)

1. Down yet another rabbithole.  _`:misc:art:draft:`_ (`rabbithole-fulgate-wilcox`)

1. "faculty" - singular or plural verb forms? _`:writing:sketch:short:`_
http://www.dictionary.com/e/collective-nouns/.  When I write things
like "faculty have chosen", Grammarly always tells me to use "faculty
*has* chosen".  But that feels wrong to me.  So I change my text
to "faculty *members* have chosen", which makes both of us happy.
But do I really have to change?  Let's see what the InterWeb tells me.

1. Bridging/interdisciplinary courses.  _`:academia:overcommitment:`_
Which ones would I like to teach?
Something on digital humanities with Erik or Sarah.  Someting on
digital art with Jeremy, Andrew, and/or Justin.  History of computers
with Mike Guenther.  Technology policy as part of policy studies.
Piracy _`:-).  But more than any of those, I'd like to teach Tutorial
again.

1. Flying from Grinnell.  _`:short:sketch:grinnell:`_ (`flying-from-grinnell`)

1. A procedure is worth 1000 pictures.  _`:csc151:art:teaching:`_
Useful to think about as I consider the project for the new CSC 151.
Do I still need to write this one?  Yeah, it will still be fun.

1. Goldenberg's Peanut Chews.  _`:autobiographical:short:`_
My favorite candy.  (Which I don't eat any more.)   Love the somewhat
stale peanut taste, the consistency, etc.  Also brings back memories.
My grandmother used to keep a dish of them in her front hallway.

1. Tracing citations.  _`:sketch:joc:short:`_ (`binary-search-citations`)  

1. Synchronizing my systems. _`:joc:sketch:`_  (`joc-synchronizing-stuff`)

1. Making breakfast.  _`:authobiographical:short:sketch:`_
Write about making french toast and thinking back to mom.  Perhaps also
the other breakfast foods in our house:`_ Omelettes and my dad's omelette
pan and baked eggs.  Maybe grandma's baked apples.  I should make those!
These days, bagels are part of the family repoirtoire.

1. Organizing my music.  _`:autobiographical:draft:`_ (`organizing-my-mp3s`)

1. Odd Bodkins.  _`:reviews:autobiographical:strips:`_
If I made it a Tutorial topic, perhaps we could go visit the archives.
http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/berkeley/bancroft/p2013_022_cubanc_aspace.pdf

1. I'm an introvert.  _`:autobiographical:short:`_
When I was first accepted as an Obermann Digital Bridges fellow at UIowa,
I was hopeful that I would have someone to commute with.  But the other
Grinnell fellow lives in or near Iowa City.  So I'm driving on my own.  And
I'm realizing that that's a good thing.  I'm an introvert.  I appreciate time
to myself.  Sometimes I forget how much I appreciate that time.

1. Font choices.  _`:teaching:technology:accessibility:`_
Grinnell's insistence on using a display font for running text, as well
as some comments of the effects of Futura on students with reading issues,
has gotten me thinking more about ways to use fonts for messaging.  I was
considering using a dyslexic-friendly font, such as OpenDyslexic.  Then
I found a study.
<https://blog.dyslexia.com/good-fonts-for-dyslexia-an-experimental-study/>

1. "Wicked Neat"  <https://owlcation.com/humanities/Wicked-Slang-Origin> _`:language:short:`_

1. Knowing courses vs. Knowing the Invisible _`:academia:rambly:short:`_
<https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Crowdsourced-Tool-Helps/244036>

1. Cowboys, revisited.  _`:misc:revisit:short:`_

1. Becoming an icon (no, the other kind).  _`:misc:short:`_

1. Becoming a celebrity (before or after Scarlet and Give Back day).  _`:grinnell:short:delayed:`_
   I'm still not sure why I was designated a celebrity.

1. I love Grinnell.  _`:grinnell:short:sketch:delayed:`_
(Reflections from meeting with Ologie.  I love our
students.  I love my thoughtful colleagues.  I love the College's
ability to support many of our students.  Whenever I get frustrated
with the institution, I have to remember those things.)

1. Writing daily.  _`:writing:short:`_  (`writing-daily`)

1. Becoming an icon.  _`:misc:short:sketch:`_
While I was playing around with various issues related to the College
Web site, I decided to think about icons.  There's a Web editor.
http://www.xiconeditor.com/.

1. The Montreal Trip.  _`:grinnell:short:sketch:`_
Rachel ILM.  Vivek a new job.  Kumail Famous.  Erin Slate.  Isabela.
Not sure.  Sarah.  Just moved on from Cloudera.  Damn.  Who else
was there?  Did Ellie go?  She's a famous physics educator with a new
last name.

1. Summer funding absurdities.  _`:rant:academia:short:sketch:`_ (`summer-funding-absurdities`)

1. Porting callisto.  _`:callisto:short:`_  An introduction to this topic.

1. Preserving digital evidence.  _`:callisto:complicated:draft:`_ (`preserving-digital-evidence`)

1. Abusing software.  _`:misc:callisto:technology:draft:`_ (`abusing-callisto`)

1. Branching.  _`:rants:code:teaching:callisto:`_ (`branching-2018-07-nn`)

1. Really bad C code. _`:rants:short:code:`_
<https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/Massacring-C-Pointers/index.html>

1. About EOCEs.  _`:rants:draft:long:teaching:rewrites:`_
(Based on <http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/about-eoc.html>)
(Now at `grinnell-eoce`.)

1. Portable cellos.  _`:short:sketch:music:`_ (`portable-cellos.md`)

1. Upgrading my class for the new Java. _`:joc:csed:sketch:long:teaching:`_  (`csc207-new-java`)

1. The CS Commons.  _`:grinnell:short:`_ (`cs-commons`)  

1. Are almonds tree nuts?  _`:misc:short:`_
In writing about [my allergy to tree nuts](nut-allergies), I noted that
I'm not allergic to almonds.  I thought it would be useful to add a bit
more background on that issue. Vince Eckhart.  Michelle and I have different
memories of what happened next.  Here's what the Smithsonian says:`_
<https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/tree-nut-allergies-may-be-massively-overdiagnosed-180962927/>

1. The joy of code camps.  _`:code-camps:teaching:long:`_
Agreed to do it because it seemed like a good thing.  And it's something
our community really wants.  There's also a joy in knowing that we're
encouraging some kids who might not otherwise think about higher education
to start thining about it.  (And some kids who might not otherwise think
about CS to start thinking about it.)  But boy, does it sap my energy.
And it's not really in my wheelhouse.  What does it do for the undergraduates?

1. Buying books.  _`:autobiographical:sketch:short:`_
I enjoy buying books.  I also enjoy reading books.  But sometimes it seems like
I spend more time buying the books than reading them. I need to find a way
to turn that habit around.  Maybe when things are quieter I'll find more time
to read.  Will things ever be quieter?

1. More fun with HTML and xexp _`:rant:Racket:code-camps:draft:`_

1. Notes from Students/Moral modeling. _`:teaching:short:sketch:`_
Before I started musing, I would occasionally post short notes to Facebook.
(Yes, I realize that's what people use Facebook for.)  Facebook is fond
of reminding me of those onld notes.  (Yes, I realize that's something
Facebook does for everyone.)  Here's a note from 23 June 2013 that
sruck home. 
> One of those things that makes the job worth it: I got a
note from a graduating senior that says "Thank you for being such an
inspiring mentor during the past 3 years that I have known you. Your
classes - aside from teaching the actual subject - incorporated many
important life lessons from me - that it is important to say goodbye,
that every student brings something unique to the whole class, and that
caring about others matters more than grades. I think these lessons were
so powerful because you actually live by these principles."  Of course,
the first two lessons come from the last day of class speech that I stole
from mom. But it's nice to see that I model behavior for the students.
(I can then add a bunch of followups.)

1. Redirects.  _`:misc:short:rants:`_
The other day, I was reading my daily email message from Book Bub.  For
those who don't know, Book Bub recommends books that are currently on sale
on Amazon.  Book Bub also has some advertisements for books.  I clicked
on one of the advertisements [It doesn't really matter what the advertisement
was for] and was surprised to see the number of redirects.  I *think* this
is all of them.  The link led to `outbound.bookbub.com`.  That redirected
to `n.bookbub.com/l/nk/`.  That, in turn, redirected to `amzn.to`.
From there to `bit.ly`.  And, finally, that redirected to `amazon.com`.
Boy, that's a lot of redirects.  Wait!  Why wasn't there a urldefense
link at the start of the chain?  Isn't Proofpoint supposed to rewrite
every URL to go to a urldefense site first.  Have we turned off
urldefense?  Let's see ... Oh, it appears that urldefense is not used
for really long links.  Wow, that makes me feel secure.

1. The list ADT.  _`:teaching:oer:joc:sketch:`_  (`list-adt`)

1. Dynamic programming _`:teaching:oer:joc:sketch:`_  (`dynamic-programming.md`)

1. Loop invariants.  _`:teaching:oer:joc:sketch:`_
Not something I learned as a student.  A useful analysis techniue,
but also a useful design technique.  Experience of different faculty
teaching from Gries.  Watching other folks teach loop invariants,
and reading a variety instructions materials, it's clear that
folks think of loop invariants somewhat differently.  Since I get to
corrupt students with my view, I thought I'd also share it with you.
(Lots of places in the curriculum.

1. How do I approach that problem?  _`:teaching:sketch:`_
In our recent debrief of exit interviews, one particular comment from
a graduating senior generated a lot of discussion.  Approximately, "While
most students develop a strategy for the problem solving process in CSC 151,
there are students who do not and would benefit from a more explicit
process."  My feeling is that I illustrate a process every time we do
large-group recitation-based problem solving.  But I accept that that's
implicit, rather than explicit.  I also accept a colleague's comment that
few students take careful notes on the broader problem issue.

1. Why complain?  _`:rants:short:sketch:`_  (`why-complain`)

1. Color problems _`:misc:art:short:sketch:`_ (`color-problems`)

1. Arts and computing.  _`:teaching:sketch:`_ (`arts-and-computing`)

1. vi  _`:technical:misc:`_
<https://thenewstack.io/a-look-at-vim-a-text-editor-for-the-ages/>

1. Down a (programming) language rabbithole.  _`:misc:sketch:`_ (`pharo.md`)

1. Take-home exams.  (Why I give them, etc.)  _`:teaching:`_

1. Friday the 13th.  _`:misc:pogo:short:`_  Three in 2026!  (I've done
it once already, so I need to think of other things to write about it.)
I make it a habit of saying things like "Be careful; Friday the 13th
falls on a Friday this month".  That habit comes from too much time
reading Walt Kelly's _Pogo_.  One of the Kelly's main characters,
Churchy La Famme [n], regularly reflects on the danger of Friday the 13th,
no matter what day of the week it falls on.  I've already written
[very a short musing on the topic](friday-the-thirteenth-2018-04-13),
so I'm not sure that another one is necessary, except to tell the
back story.  I was clearly distractable when recording this potential
topic.  I see that I determined that Friday the Thirteenth would occur
on three separate Fridays in 2026.
[n] I wonder how that name would be received these days if the strip
were new.


1. Double majors, revisited.  _`:grinnell:draft:`_ (`double-majors-2018-05-xx`)

1. Woody Guthrie Jesus Christ and Jesse James _`:misc:draft:`_ (`getting-it-backwards`)  

1. Eboards.  _`:teaching:sketch:`_ (`sketches/eboards.md`) 

1. Assessment.  _`:teaching:draft:rant:`_ (`assesment-revisited.md`) 
Two musings for the price of one?  Experience assessing courses.
Mistrusting assessment.  Split 'em.  `assessment-revisited.md` "What's
sad is that I really do believe in "closing the loop":`_ Reflect on what
you've seen in your classes.  Think about what that means you should
change.  Make the change.  Consider the impact.  Repeat."  But you don't
need formalized assessment practices for that loop.  You just need to pay
attention, introspect, and discuss. (_Needs rewriting.  Should probably
focus on just the mistrust issue._)

1. Losing weight.  _`:autobiographical:draft:`_ (`losing-weight`) 

1. Peoples' names.  _`:rant:draft:`_ (`misnaming.md`) 

1. A Grinnell Growth Mindset _`:grinnell:draft:`_ (`grinnell-growth-mindset`)

1. Supporting admissions.  _`:grinnell:sketch:`_ (`supporting-admissions`)

1. Playing with mail.app rules  _`:joc:mac:email:short:`_
Started setting up a number of rules  Then asked myself: "How do I easily
move them to another laptop?"  The answer is that they are in
`~/Library/Mail/V4/MailData/SyncedRules.plist`.  That means I can also
do things like take my filter of too-many advertisements and rearrange
them so that they are in alphabetical order.  At least I think it does.

1. Cary Nelson's piece on "The Economic Challenges of Anthologies" in _On Anthologies_.  _`:sketch:academia:short:`_
Really fascinating.  I picked it up after
reading [an article about the challenges of creating an anthology
of Gene Kelly inteviews](rhetorical-gestures-kelly-tolkien).  ...
And look!  There's an article by my now-SFS colleague, Alan Schrift,
immediately after Nelson's piece.  Nelson's comment on an Elizabeth
Bishop poem.  Then I realize that's the same Elizabeth Bishop whose
"[One Art](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47536/one-art)" we turned to again and again in _Lighting the Page_.    New edition mentioned at
<http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/>.  Says that the suggested
list price is $79.95.  But when I look at the Oxford site,
[Volume 1](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/anthology-of-modern-american-poetry-9780199920723?lang=en&cc=us) is $72.95 and
[Volume 2](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/anthology-of-contemporary-american-poetry-9780199920730?cc=us&lang=en&) is also $72.95.  That's a lot
higher than the claimed list price.  I guess the economic realities of
the new edition were also troubling.

1. One Art.  _`:miscellaenous:writing:short:sketch:`_
(see previous notes, too)  And then Sam returns to his normal search for where it was originally published.  Finds [article on drafts](http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/bishop/drafts.htm) and [better article on drafts](https://bluedragonfly10.wordpress.com/2009/06/12/one-art-the-writing-of-loss-in-elizabeth-bishop%E2%80%99s-poetry/).  Finally found the original publication. 
[_The New Yorker_, 26 April 1976, p. 40](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1976/04/26/one-art).  Why was that so hard to find?  Not what I thought.  I thought  the partner had died.  They hadn't. 

1. git sack _`:miscellaneous:technical:git:short:`_
What to do if someone pushes non-working code to the main branch.
Wow!  The original title (git lynch) was offensive.  Sometimes I'm
much too clueless.  (Will I include that note.)

1. The classroom goes public.  _`:academia:teaching:reaction:`_
<https://www.chronicle.com/article/What-Happens-in-the-Classroom/243974>

1. Code style  _`:joc:teaching:sketch:`_  (`code-style`)

1. More introduction.  _`:meta:sketch:rambly:`_ (`intro-musing-topics-v0`)

1. Requiring a cultural competency course.  _`:grinnell:sketch:`_
What would it do to an open curriculum?  Is it necessary?  It may be.
Do we really want to graduate a student who has not thought carefully
about these issues?  (Of course, do we really want to graduate a
student who cannot read graphs, charts, and data in a newspaper?
At what point does "Do we really want to graduate _this student_
become an exercise in adding requirements?)  What would it be like
to teach that course?  (Some portion of the students would clearly
object to being there.)  I did have a debate about this with the
legendary Karla Erickson.  I'm not sure what side I took.

1. Tagging the musings. _`:meta:short:sketch:`_
See notes above.

1. Why I complain about software.  _`:rants:software:`_ I complain a lot
about bad software.  And I think a lot of software is bad.  Here I
reflect more deeply about these issues.

1. On representing dates and times.  _`:rants:short:`_
Why I hate things like "12:00 p.m." or "6/12/64".

1. Why Grinnell staff with Ph.D's should be allowed to teach.  _`:rants:old:`_
I thought we allowed our Ph.D.-level staff to teach the occasional course.
Then I learned that it's only in very specific situations.  These are
my attempts to think through the matter.  [Or maybe they've fixed this.]

1. Using mail signatures as templates.  _`:short:tips:joc:`_

1. Strange student requests.  _`:rants:teaching:short:sketch:`_
About once per week, a student either comes to office hours or sends me
a question of the form "I have a great idea for an app/startup.  Can
you give me advice/hook me up with a developer/etc."  But, well, these
aren't my area of expertise.  Do faculty in other disciplines get these
kinds of requests?  "I have an idea for a great Russian novel."  "I'm
going to synthesize a new chemical compound."  Now that I think about
it, it is possible that it's potentially a relatively common thing, at
least in some disciplines.  "I care about this social issue; help me
design a study.  I wrote a short story; please read it.  I have an art
project I want to do, can I use your resources."

1. Topic modeling.  _`:dighum:teaching:`_
<http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-and-digital-humanities-by-david-m-blei/> is a good introduction.

1. Scratch 3.0.  _`:scratch:teaching:technology:`_
<https://beta.scratch.mit.edu/>

1. Nonsequiters anonymous.  _`:short:sketch:`_  (`nonsequiters-anonymous`)

1. personal-professional harmony.  _`:long:revisit:academia:`_
Rewrite/revise sections from work-life balance.

1. Forgetting what we read. _`:miscellaneous:articles:`_
<https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/551603/>

1. Spaces after sentences.  _`:writing:articles:short:`_
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/05/04/one-space-between-each-sentence-they-said-science-just-proved-them-wrong-2/>

1. Beanworld.  _`:reviews:comics:`_

1. Orphan Black.  _`:reviews:rambly:tv:`_
When a friend was visiting recently, they convinced the Rebelsky family
to start streaming _Orphan Black_ on TV.  For those of you not familiar
with the show ....  In spite of my friends' claims to the contrary, it's
a fairly dark show; we generally find that we have to watch something
funny afterwards (e.g., _The Big Bang Theory_ or _The Good Place_).  At
one point, I was thinking it would make a good topic for my next Tutorial;
the show raises themes of intellectual property, genetics, feminism,
and more.  But, well, I still think I'd prefer to do something relating
to comic strips [possibilities include Pogo and Walt Kelly, Dan O'Neill
and Odd Bodkins, the American comic strip, comic strips and the Web
(aka Webcomics)], hypertext, or board games.

1. The legendary yearbook (Grinnell).  _`:grinnell:photography:`_

1. Jonathan Richman.  _`:reviews:music:`_
One of my favorite musicians.

1. Jon Svetkey and the Loomers.  _`:reviews:music:`_
More of my favorite musicians.

1. Yacht Race.  _`:reviews;board games:`_
One of my favorite board games.

1. Astral Weeks.  _`:reviews:music:`_
One of my all-time favorite albums.

1. Van Morrison (or at least Astral Weeks).  _`:reviews:music:`_
Another of my favorite musicians.

1. Physimusicomedy.  _`:autobiograpical:film:short:`_
My favorite essay topic for my collegiate film
classes.  (Also, perhaps the best essay I wrote for Gerald Mast.
I wonder if I'll every find that essay again.)

1. Sam Hurt's _Eyebeam_.  _`:reviews:strips:`_
One of my favorite comic strips.

1. Ethics in the CS curriculum.  _`:department:CS:ethics:sketch:`_
One of the many things I appreciate about Grinnell's CS department is that
all of the faculty find it essential that we help our students consider the
ethical implications of the work that we do.  Strangely enough, even though
we all prioritize this issue, we do not require a partiuclar ethics course.
Rather, we try to incorporate it throughout the CS curriculum.

1. "As We May Think"  _`:articles:CS:`_
A great paper to read and assign. 

1. MLK Day _`:grinnell:`_

1. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  _`:music:rambly:`_
How did the Cars get in?  Did they influence anyone?  I'm pretty sure
that David Robinson (drummer for the Cars, not the basketball player
nor the Grinnell CIO) thinks DMZ (one of his other bands).  Why is
that Muddy Waters is in as a Performer (the primary award), but Howlin'
Wolf is in as an influence?  What other women belong?  (Dionne Warwick,
Marianne Faithful - Broken English is a masterpiece, at least in my
world.)  And where are the bands of my late teenage years?  Why no
Husker Du, Minutemen, the Replacements, X?  It's clear that the first two influenced
lots of bands.  Green Day are and Nirvana are in, and it's pretty clear
that they wouldn't have existed if it hadn't been for the Huskers, the
'Mats.  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_inductees>  And where are Richard Thompson and Fairport convention, one of
Rock's most important guitarists and a key English folk-rock band?
Pere Ubu should be there.  It's Cleveland, after all.

1. A family-friendly college _`:grinnell:academia:short:requests:`_
Jennifer Weinman's request: "I think a good future musing (add it to your list...) would be something about kid-friendly faculty environments, or having kids pre-tenure. It's something I've talked about with many, but don't see publicly discussed in print all that often."  I could start with the old Faculty House Faculty Fridays.  It could be in the musing for prospective faculty.

Dear Grinnell student
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

Dear PO'd Grinnell Student,

It appears that you know who I am.  However, since you signed the note
you left on my windshield only as "PO'd Grinnell Student" (using the
longer form of PO'd), I do not know who you are.  Hence, I have chosen
to respond to you through my 'blog.

I am sorry that you were bothered by my choice to park in a "student"
spot on a Sunday afternoon when I had work to do on campus.  It was my
understanding that parking was effectively open on campus on weekends.
Many students seem to feel free to park in the Staff/Faculty spots;
I believe I counted at least a half dozen in the Noyce parking lot when
I was looking for parking.  It's also the case that the spot I used was,
until recently, a Faculty/Staff parking spot.

Since you put my name on the note, you know who I am.  You should,
therefore, know that I do not use profanity in my classes and ask my
students to follow a similar form of polite discourse.  Hence, I am
disappointed that you felt it necessary to use profanity, not only in the
signature, but also in your note.  I do not appreciate being addressed
with a four-letter word.  As you prepare for your life after Grinnell,
please remember that using such language will not endear you to your
coworkers or supervisors.

I will admit that I am also concerned about how upset you seem to be about
the matter.  While I realize that parking can be frustrating, the loss of
a parking spot should not lead to this level of hostility.  Compared to the
many frustrating things happening in our country and on our campus, a parking
spot is a relatively minor issue.

I hope that, in the future, you will consider leaving more polite
messages.  I also hope that you will take the time to leave similar
notes on the student vehicles in the Faculty/Staff spots.  I would
suggest something like, "Dear fellow student, I realize that it's the
weekend.  But many staff and faculty work on weekends.  Please don't
take the Faculty/Staff spots so that they can more easily get to their
workplaces."

If you feel the need to include profanity on notes on windshields,
I would suggest you do that for the student vehicles that clog that
loading zones for hours on end.

Regards,

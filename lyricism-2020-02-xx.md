Much of the work we are reading in _The Craft of Creative Nonfiction_
is lyrical in some way or other.  Some is explicitly lyrical; the lyrical
essay is a genre in of itself.  Some weaves lyricism in at select pieces,
injecting a bit of extra wonder or thoughtfulness.

While I enjoy playing with language, I find myself struggling to be lyrical,
to employ associations, metaphors, analogies, similes.  In many ways, I
am a concrete thinker, trapped in a morass of stone, clay, and sediment.
See?

It doesn't help that some works scale heights I can never imagine
reaching.  I think, in particular, of to the privilege we have to
read Tito Rajarshi Mukhopadhyay's [_Plankton
Dreams_](http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/books/titles/plankton-dreams/).
Is "read" the right verb?  We experience it, embrace it, puzzle
over it, learn from it.  The ways in which he reframes the world
and his experience of it have beauty and humor, make me think about
things differently.  But you don't have to take my word for it.
Experience it yourself.  Tito [1] has graciously released his book
through the [Open Humanities
Press](http://www.openhumanitiespress.org/books/titles/plankton-dreams/).
That means you can download a free PDF.  You might also be able to order
a printed version, like I did.  But, like me, you'd be forced to wait until
Amazon decides to reprint it.  Maybe you should start with the PDF.

Reading Mukhopadhyay also reminds me of why so many parents are reluctant
to have someone "cure" their children's autism.  This gift of writing
seems fragile.  As a parent, I would not want to lose it.  More
importantly, it's why many autists are likely reluctant to be "cured".  I
am reminded of the comment that appears at the end of my instructor's email.

> Dr. Sanjay Gupta: "DJ, should autism be treated?"

> DJ Savarese: "Yes, treated with respect."

> --CNN Interview

Lyrical.

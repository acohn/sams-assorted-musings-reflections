One of the many great things about Grinnell is that we offer a wide
variety of summer workshops for faculty and staff [1].  The mechanism
for determining which summer workshops will be offered involves multiple
stages.  First, people who are interested in hosting workshops submit
workshop proposals.  Next, the workshops are advertised and those
that garner an appropriate deal of interest are offered, provided
there is enough funding.  It used to be that the Instructional
Support Committee (ISC) selected from among the workshop proposals,
but I think we moved on to a popularity model.  I could be wrong
[2].  Some workshops are funded through the Center for Teaching,
Learning, and Assessment (CTLA) budget.  Some are funded through
external grants or other internal budgets.  For example, there is
often money in an Innovation Fund project to support workshops.

I have one "individual" Innovation Fund Planning Project and one
group Innovation Fund Planning Project.  Both will involve summer
workshops.  I had hoped to offer two-day workshops, but it looks
like the fewest number of days one can offer is three.  That may
be worth revisiting with the CTLA.  Three-day workshops count toward
the cap of two paid workshops per faculty member [3].  I was hoping
that two-day workshops would not.  Oh well, I'll revisit that question
with the director of the CTLA.

Let's see.  What information do we have to provide?

> Workshop Leader and Email.

> Co-leader Name and Email (if applicable).

> Type of workshop (select one): (3-day, 4-day, or 4-day).

> Proposed workshop title.

> Brief description of workshop.

> Target audience for the workshop (provide more detailed information in the text field): Faculty, Staff.

> Departments or concentrations to which knowledge gained in the workshop will contribute.

> Expected outcomes of the workshop.

> Select a week that the workshop may be held (select up to 3).
(If you have a top choice, please note this in the text field. Final
scheduling will be determined in March.)

> Your estimated budget for extra expenses if applicable (e.g. books, presenters, etc.).  Don't include catering costs or stipends which are assumed for 3-5 day workshops.

> If you have special funding available to support the workshop, describe here.

> Do you have any special scheduling or technical needs for this workshop?  Do you want shared intranet space on GrinnellShare (e.g. document library)?  Do you have a location request?  If so, please describe here:

Wow.  That doesn't seem nearly as bad as I thought.  Here goes.

> Type of workshop (select one): (3-day, 4-day, or 4-day). _3-day._

> Proposed workshop title.  _A more humanistic approach to assessing Grinnell students' individual curricula_

> Brief description of workshop. _We will explore alternative approaches to supporting and assessing the success of Grinnellâ€™s Individually Advised Curriculum (IAC) in ways more closely tied to our goals for the IAC than those used for the last reaccreditation, which focused primarily on counting courses taken in each division. We will likely consider mechanisms that explicitly require students to articulate their understanding of the liberal arts in writing and to argue for the corresponding design of their four-year plans, perhaps with a form of public "curriculum defense"._

> Target audience for the workshop (provide more detailed information in the text field): Faculty, Staff.  _This workshop is open to any faculty and staff with an interest in the IAC._

> Departments or concentrations to which knowledge gained in the workshop will contribute.  _[Blank]_

> Expected outcomes of the workshop.  _The workshop will produce a proposal
for a pilot project that asks students to articulate their understanding
of the liberal arts and their rationale for their four-year plans.

> Select a week that the workshop may be held (select up to 3).
(If you have a top choice, please note this in the text field. Final
scheduling will be determined in March.)  _May 26, June 1, or _June 22_.

> Your estimated budget for extra expenses if applicable (e.g. books, presenters, etc.).  Don't include catering costs or stipends which are assumed for 3-5 day workshops. _Nothing additional is needed._

> If you have special funding available to support the workshop, describe here.  _This workshop will be supported with our Innovation Fund Planning Grant._

> Do you have any special scheduling or technical needs for this workshop?  Do you want shared intranet space on GrinnellShare (e.g. document library)?  Do you have a location request?  If so, please describe here: _We would like a shared intranet space on GrinnellShare_.

It appears that I was much too anxious about this.  Now that I have a
draft, I should run it by my co-lead.  I've sent [my notes on the 
Convocation proposal] to my co-leads there.

[1] One of the less good things about Grinnell is that while most
faculty are compensated for participating in the workshops, staff
and library faculty are not.

[2] It appears that I am wrong.  The form says "Summer workshops
proposals will be reviewed by the CTLA and the ISC."

[3] I assume some faculty who see that there are multiple workshops
of interest will prioritize the five-day workshops.  On the other hand, 
I know from my own experience that when I see more than two workshops
in which I want to participate, I offer to go to the three-day workshops
without compensation.

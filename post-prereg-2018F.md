Updates on preregistration for fall 2018
========================================

_Topics/tags: [Registration](index-registration), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), rambly, long_

I recently wrote about [preregistration for fall 2018](prereg-2018F),
identifying courses that were over-enrolled.  At the time,
I suggested that I might come back to the classes and see what
departments did.  Here goes.  You can still look at the [current
registration data](https://itwebapps.grinnell.edu/DotNet/CourseOffering/)
if you'd like.  I'm looking at the data as of Friday, 4 May 2018.

I'm not sure that this musing will be quite as interesting to you, but
I'd like to go through the exercise anyway.

* AMS-305, _Cultural Politics of Fashion_ was capped at
  15 students and had 18.  It now has 17.  I expect that one student
  decided to take another class and Katya decided to allow the rest
  to stay.
* Tess Kulstad's Anthropology Special Topic on _Health, Inequality, and
  Social Justice_ was over-enrolled by 9.  It is now cut to its cap of 20.
* One section of ART-111 was over-enrolled by six.  It appears that
  those students got cut.  I was worried that there would be no slots
  open for first-year students, but it appears that they were able to
  add another section of intro.
* ART-134, _Drawing_, was over-enrolled by twenty-two students for a
  course that has a cap of 15 (and needs a cap of 15).  Strangely,
  it is now down to ten students.  I wonder if they made the decision
  to over-cut so that students could argue their way back in.    But
  between the regular over-enrollments in _Drawing_ and _Introduction to
  the Studio_, it feels like Studio Art needs a new position.  I do see
  that a Mellon Postdoc (I think) allows them to add a new 100-level
  Film/Video Production course in the fall.  I expect that will draw
  some of the students who were taking 111 or 134.
* It looks like they were able to balance the two labs for _Intro to
  Biological Chemistry_.
* It also looks like they were able to balance the five (!!) sections
  of BIO-251, _Molecules, Cells, and Organisms_.  About 120 students
  are taking one of those five sections.
* BIO-380, _Molecular Biology_ was over-enrolled by eight students.
  That's a class that's almost impossible to expand.  It looks like
  they had to cut the eight students; Bio has enough experience with
  cutting that class that I'm sure they figured out to minimize the
  damage to students.
* The four sections of CHM-221, _Organic Chemistry I_, were over-enrolled
  by 28 students, with one section over-enrolled by 20 and one by
  17.  As seems to be the norm for Chemistry, they've balanced the
  over-enrolled courses, but have not dropped any students.  They did add
  another lab section and it looks like all of those are at a reasonable
  size.  But between the four sections, we appear to have 123 students
  taking Organic.  How much overlap is there with BIO-251?  I'm not sure.
* The one section of Physical Chemistry I was over-enrolled by nine
  students and is now over-enrolled by seven, putting it at 31 students.
  Given that they stayed over-enrolled, I'm assuming that some students
  decided to take another course.  As I expected, they were able to add
  a third lab section so that those are at a reasonable size.
* Monessa Cummins' Classics/History 257, _The Roman Republic_, had 37
  students.  That's usually where Monessa's classes stand at the end of
  preregistration.  She cut it down to 25.  I still don't see how she
  gives the amount of attention to students that she does with a class
  of 25.
* Our two sections of CSC-207, _Object-Oriented Problem Solving,
  Data Structures, and Algorithms_ were unbalanced, with one over-enrolled
  by 11 and the other with 9 slots available.  I recall the registrar
  telling us that those would be hard to balance, but it appears they
  succeeded.  Henry Walker's section remains over-enrolled by 2 (26
  students), but I've never known Henry to turn a student away.
* We had a similar imbalance in CSC-211, _Computer Organization and
  Architecture_ [1].  We also balanced those sections.  The two section are
  now full.  I'm glad we are able to serve all interested students.
  I remain worried about what will happen with CSC-213, _Operating
  Systems_, in the spring.
* CSC 324, _Software Design and Development_ was over-enrolled by six
  students.  That was too many for a projects-based course with a new
  faculty member.  We cut the ones who had another CS course, which isn't
  ideal, but which seems fair in terms of distributing limited resources.
  Fortunately, we're scheduled to have two sections in the spring.
* Economics/Policy Studies 220, _Foundations of Policy Analysis_ was
  over-enrolled by five.  It is now slightly below cap.  I expect that
  those departments are following the strategy that I attributed to
  _Drawing_: cut a few extra and let students petition to get back in.
* ECN-240, _Resource and Environmental Economics_, remains
  over-enrolled by fourteen students.  I'm not sure how Mark will teach
  all 39 students, but it seems like he's going to try.
* Section 2 of ECN-282, Macroeconomic Analysis_ was over-enrolled
  by five students with twelve slots available in section 1.
  I'm surprised to see that they only shifted five students, giving 18
  in section 1 and 25 in section 2; CS would normally balance the two
  sections in that situation.
* Unsurprisingly, ECN-327, _Corporate Finance_ was over-enrolled
  by twelve students.  I mentioned a lot of reasons in the prior musing.
  I forgot to mention that students also love Eric Orhn, who teaches
  the course.  Eric left the course over-enrolled by 4, making it a
  large 300-level Econ course.
* While I know that Ralph Savarese was thrilled at the number of students
  who wanted to learn to write poetry, he seems to have found a way to
  cut it down to the cap of 15, which is about all you can really teach
  when you pay close attention to writing.  I hope some of the poetry
  students find a place in _Craft of Creative Nonfiction_, which is
  equally exciting.
* English 224, _Traditions of English Literature II_ was over-enrolled by
  four students.  It's now at capacity.
* English 310, _Studies in Shakespeare_, was over-enrolled by eight
  students.  That's a challenge to deal with since it's an upper-level
  seminar that students likely need and it's not something that others
  can teach.  I talked to John Garrison, who is teaching that seminar,
  and I know that his primary plan was to keep all seniors and let
  the juniors know that they'd have another opportunity next year.
  I assume that some of the students who were cut can take ENG_360,
  _Seminar  in Postcolonial Literature_.
* GDS-320, _Applied Policy Analysis_ remained over-enrolled by three.
  Nineteen seems a bit big for that kind of project-based class, but
  Monty is also experienced at the class and can likely find a way to
  handle it.
* I know that my newly-tenured colleague, Carolyn Herbst Lewis [2],
  agonized about cutting students.  But I also know that there's she
  should not have to deal with two over-enrolled 200-level courses.
  So both HIS-222, _Women in American History_, and HIS-223, _Health
  and Medicine in American History_, are at their cap of 25 [3].
* It appears that Jennifer Paulhus was able to cut the two sections of
  Linear Algebra to their cap of 28 each.  I know that Jen worked hard
  on that problem, contacting individual advisors to determine how the
  course fit in students' plans [4].
* It appears that they had to cut four students from MAT-321, _Foundations
  of Abstract Algebra_.  I assume those students will generally move to
  _Foundations of Analysis_, which has room.
* Music 120-01, _Performance: Violin_, remains over-enrolled by four
  students.  In contrast, a number of students in Lisa Henderson's 120-02,
  _Performance: Voice_, seems to have been shifted to another section
  of Voice.  What about the music performance classes?  I was told that
  if you didn't preregister, you might not get in.  But I see that many
  of them are listed as open [5]
* Johanna Meehan cut her Philosophy / Political Science special topics
  course on _Reading Arendt_ to its cap of 20.  I wonder how she chose
  who to cut.
* POL-257, _Nationalism_, is now at its cap of 25 [7].  I assume the
  students who were cut will switch to another Political Science class,
  but POL-251, _International Political Economy_, appears to be the only
  other 200-level class that's still open.  It may be that PoliSci, as
  another department with a high student-to-faculty ratio, makes similar
  resource decisions that we make in CS [8].  makes similar decisions
  to CS.  Science classes.
* PST-320, _Applied Policy Analysis_, remains over-enrolled by three.
  I was going to say "Doug probably needs to let all the Policy Studies
  concentrators stay in."  Then I realized that it has the same title as
  GDS-320.  Then I realized that Doug and Monty are co-teaching the course
  [9].   But 19 is still a lot for an upper-level, project-based course.
* SOC-265, _Sociology of Health and Illness_, is now over-enrolled
  by only two, rather than fifteen.  I'm not sure how Susan makes the
  decisions on who to cut.  At least there are a few really awesome
  200-level Soc courses still available, including Ross Heanfler's
  _Deviance and Social Control_, Kesho Scott's _Race and Ethnicity in
  America_, and a special topic on _Environmental Sociology_ [10].
* The Sociology special topics on _Mass Media and
  Society_ is now at capacity.  As I mentioned, there are a variety of cool
  Soc courses available.
* In my prior musing, I had missed that Chris Hunter's SOC-350, _NGOs:
  Organizing to Do Good_ [11], was over-enrolled by two.  It's nice to
  see that Chris left everyone in that seminar.
* SPN-312, _Women and Gender in Spanish Literature_, was over-enrolled
  by fifteen students.  There are now two sections.  I'm surprised to see
  that they cut the five-person _Culture of the Spanish-Speaking World_
  for that to happen.  I don't know the Spanish department pressures
  well enough, but it strikes me that I'd look to compress at the 100
  level in this case [12].
* The two sections of SST-125, _Introduction to Geographic Information
  Systems_, are now balanced.
* The two sections of STA-310, _Statistical Modeling_, are now balanced.
  So the afternoon issue was not as much of a problem as I predicted.
  It appears that a few students were cut along the way.

Is this all that happened in the week since preregistration ended?
No.  I'm pretty sure that a few low-enrollment courses got cut completely.
I don't know what got added in their stead [14].  There are courses
that were not over-enrolled that were nonetheless balanced.  Amazingly,
it's better for everyone, both faculty and students, if there are two
moderate-sized sections rather than one small and one large.  And I
know that some students got cut from classes to ensure that there's room
for incoming first-year students.  We certainly cut a few from CSC-151.
I know other departments that cut students from 100-level classes, too.
And then there are the disciplines, like GWSS and Linguistics, that
don't even allow 3rd-years and seniors into their 100-level classes
until after first-years register.  I keep wondering whether we should
have more uniform approaches to reserving spots for first-year students.
Is it better to allow students in and then cut them, or not to allow
them in the first place?  That seems worthy of a more general discussion.

As I reflect on the cuts that were made, I find myself wondering how
departments make decisions on cutting.  I wonder whether we'd find
it useful to have a discussion as faculty about how you make the hard
decisions as to who to cut from a course.  What factors go into play?
I expect that we could learn a bit from each other.  The question of when
you decide to allow courses to over-enroll would be a more difficult one.
Why is it, for example, that Chemistry is regularly willing to allow
courses to significantly over-enroll [15]?  And do we have common
mechanisms for determining the "normal" cap on courses?  If we don't,
should we?

That's getting a bit controversial, so let's switch back to the data.
I see that the Registrar's office has marked classes with only one or
two remaining slots as "Closed".  Such classes aren't really closed,
per se, but require an instructor's signature to add.  When classes are
close to capacity, we need a little bit of control as to who we add.
For example, if a student has been cut from another class in the
department, we probably want to give them priority to add a course.
Closing it gives us that option.

Speaking of "Closed", it may be useful to consider how our classes
stand right now.  Let's see ... 148 courses are marked as "Closed".
That includes a bunch of music lessons that I'm too lazy to count.
35 courses are marked as "Balanced".  Those are courses that students
can still add, but need an instructor's permission to do so [16].  And
there are 390 courses that are marked as "Open".  Of course, that
includes music lessons and PE courses.  There are 121 performance 
courses and 23 PE courses.  I'm not sure how many of those are open
or closed.  I need the data in a better form to do a more careful
analysis.

I do this analysis, in part, so that I can better support my students
[17].  What do I need to do for my advisees?  Unfortunately, our
system does not send out automatic messages when students are dropped
from courses or switched to other sections or otherwise have their
schedules changed.  I expect that most of them will let me know if
they observe problems.  So far, I've heard from three: One was dropped
from a 100-level class.  I told them to contact the department chair.
Two were switched to a different section of the same course.  I told
them that I supported the idea of balancing courses but would advocate
for them if they had a good reason that they needed the other section.

I'm still waiting to hear whether my students who want Linguistics will
be able to take Linguistics and whether my students who want to take
GWSS will be able to take GWSS.  Unfortunately, we'll probably have to
wait until fall to resolve that.

If I were teaching Tutorial in the fall, I might count open slots in
introductory courses.  But I'm not.  And it's late.  Perhaps that will
be a topic for another musing [18].

---

[1] At some point, I wrote "Computing Organization and Architecture".  You
think that I'd get the name of courses in our department correct!

[2] Congratulations Carolyn!

[3] I'm never sure why people choose a cap of 25 rather than 24.  I really
like 24 as a class size, since you can break it into so many different
combinations: twelve groups of two, six groups of four, eight groups of
three, and so on and so forth.

[4] Thanks, Jen, for going over and above the call of duty.

[5] I'm really interested to see how our new "everyone gets one
performance course [6] per semester without additional charge" policy
affects enrollment in these performance courses.  I hope that we'll see
most students choosing to take lessons each semester.

[6] That is, music lessons.

[7] There's another one of those 25-people class.  I don't get it.

[8] That is, because we have limited resources, people who enroll in
high-demand courses may get cut if they are in another course in the
department.

[9] From my experience, co-teaching a course does not significantly
decrease the workload, and sometimes increases it.  Now, in addition
to designing assignments and teaching class, you must also find time to
meet with your co-instructor and you must often learn a new subject area
along the way.  Few co-taught classes seem to split grading; instead,
students tend to get more feedback.

[10] There are other cool 200-level SOC courses open; those are just some
that stood out.

[11] Back when I was a graduate student, it took me a long time to figure
out that "NGO" stood for Non-Governmental Organization.

[12] Of course, I also know that it's hard to argue that you should
offer a course with under six students.  Most of the 200- and 300-level
courses with fewer than six students get cut.

[14] If I were Dean, what would I do?  That's a hard call.  If there weren't
over-enrolled courses elsewhere in the department, I'd probably ask the
instructors of cut courses to consider Tutorial in the fall. That seems
to be the most sensible "common currency".  I have less of a sense as
to what I'd do in the spring.

[15] I also used to allow my CS courses to over-enroll.  Then I had
a full semester that felt like week 14.

[16] If we didn't have that policy, students who had been "balanced"
would just switch back to the other section, eliminating the benefits
of balancing the sections.

[17] Okay, most of it is that I enjoy looking at the numbers.  But it's
also to help my advisees.

[18] "That" refers to the number of slots in introductory courses, not
the lateness of the evening.

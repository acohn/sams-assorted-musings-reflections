Closing in on one-hundred essays
================================

It's hard to believe that I'm nearly at one-hundred essays.  I guess
that there is some value to sustained effort.  Of course, it's not
all that clear why one hundred is such a milestone.  Sure, it's the
smallest positive three-digit base-ten number, but does that make it
all that special?  Oh well, I should probably embrace social norms.

What does it mean to reach one-hundred essays?  [Megan
Goering](megan-goering.html) tells me that Neil Gaiman says that you
need to get about one million words out of your system before you are
a competent writer.  If I average one-thousand words per essay [1],
I still have nine hundred more essays to write [4].  Alternately, if
you believe the adage that "It takes 10,000 hours of practice to become
good at something", and we assume it takes me about an hour per essay,
then I still have nine thousand, nine hundred hours to go [5,6].

Wow!  It feels like this essay is going down hill fast.  Okay, let's
embrace the achievement of one-hundred essays (or get ready to embrace the
achievement of one-hundred essays, since I'm not there yet).  I know,
let's turn things around a bit.  How about if you, my readers [7], send
me a short comment on your favorite essay and why it's your favorite,
and I'll compile them together?  Those comments might also help guide
those folks who have just discovered these essays and want to figure out
where to start [8].

Here are some examples.

> RS says "My favorite is [the essay on thinking the best of
  others](thinking-the-best.html) because that's where I first make an
  appearance as John Silber."

> CJ says "My favorite is [the essay on changes at
  Grinnell](grinnell-changes.html) because it's long enough to help me fall
  asleep at night.  I don't think I've made it through the whole essay yet."

> ES says "My favorite is [the one on sleep](sleep.html) because
  it contains the fewest grammatical errors."

> DR says "My favorite is [dad jokes](dad-jokes.html) because it helps
  others understand what I have to put up with each day.

> JR says "My favorite is [the one on the Web](grinnells-web-presence.html)
  because the only time you write half-decently is when you are ranting
  about something.  Well, maybe not in the case of your essay on
  [best-practices](best-practices.html), but most of the time."

> SR says "My favorite is [essay 100](essay-100.html) because I got others
  to write it for me."

> MR and HR say "Papa says that everyone should read [If you ask a prof
  a question](if-you-ask-a-prof.html) because 'the original essay [9]
  reflects curiosity, empathy and an appreciation for the human condition.
  The fact that Sam has continued to reflect on and question what he wrote
  years ago comes as no surprise and simply reinforces my perspective.'"

> AS says "I recommend that others read [all of the profiles of
  Grinnellians you should know (or know about)](index-grinnellians.html)
  because it introduced me to some really cool people."

> ?? says "I am fond of [the essay on microaggressions](microaggressions.html)
  because it reminds me that computer science is the red-headed stepchild [10]
  of the liberal arts."

> AK says "As a curmudgeon, I appreciated [the essay on the same 
  subject](curmudgeon.html).  I only wish that Rebelsky would have
  picked some aspect of campus he wanted to improve, and used the phrase
  'Fixing that is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.'"

> ?? says "You should read Sam's [incredibly misguided essay about changes at 
  Grinnnell](grinnell-changes.html), in which he completely misses how
  corporate Grinnell has become."

> MR says "If you are an administrator at Grinnell College, you really
  shouldn't read any of these essays because I'd really like Sam to keep
  his job."

> ?? says "You should note that Sam deleted his essay on Posse once he
  learned the whole story. I think that's a sign that you really don't
  need to read anything else he writes."

> AV says "The S&amp;B should publish [the Friday PSA](friday-psa.html)
  because it says things that students should hear."

> TB says "I'm amused by [the first "nibbled to death
  by ducks"](ndd-01.html) essay because it's clear that Sam doesn't
  realize that his experience is typical of both Grinnell students and
  Grinnell faculty."

> ?? says "I'm no longer reading these essays because Sam didn't bother
  to invent a quote from me [12]."

> The other RS says: "I'm not particularly fond of any of Rebelsky's
  essays, since I care deeply about good writing, or even competent
  writing.  However, if I had to pick one, it's probably [the one about
  the bookstore](bookstore.html) because it's clear he cared enough
  about it to write slightly less muddled text than normal. [14]"

> JLND [15] says "I'm fond of [the essay on MathLAN](mathlan.html) because it
  will help inform the design of my own department.  I look forward to 
  seeing another essay on [the CS commons](cs-commons.html)."

> SR also says "I also like [this essay](closing-in-on-100.html) because
  it gave me the opportunities to reflect on what I'd written so far,
  because I got to make snarky comments [16], because I think it's one
  of my funnier essays [17], because it has more endnotes than normal,
  and because this entry makes it recursive.

Of course, I'd much prefer that you wrote more than one sentence.  But
even one sentence (including how you'd like me to refer to you) would
be great.

There's only a few days left until essay one hundred.  **Get your comments
in now** [18], or you'll have to wait until another hundred essays have passed
[19].

---

[1] It feels like I write about one thousand words per essay, but I'm too lazy
to do the statistics right now [2].  

[2] In an early draft, this one was about 940 words.  But then I added
that sentence, so it became 950.  And, hey, that sentence made it
960 words or so.  With that sentence, we are now at 970 total words.
Aren't ten-word sentences an awesome idea for padding essays? [3]

[3] The preceding statistics were computed with an early version of
the essay.  It has since grown to approximately fourteen-hundred
words.

[4] Yes, I realize that I've written things before begininng these essays.
But it feels right to limit my counting to what I write in this form.

[5] Okay, that's probably not fair, since I've written a lot (and even
thought about writing) for most of my life.  

[6] Let's see ... 9,900 hours is about 1237.5 eight hour days, about
247.5 five-day work weeks, or almost five years of full-time work.  I
don't think I have that many sabbaticals remaining, even under Grinnells
new and more generous sabbatical policy.

[7] Yes, I assume that I still have readers.  I do tend to get at least two
Facebook "likes" for each essays, so I have at least two.

[8] Or even just whether there is anything worth reading.

[9] I'm not sure that the original [If you ask a prof a
question](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/AskProf) is really an
"essay".  But I guess I should aloow my readers to classify things as
they wish.

[10] I love when comments on microaggressions are themselves 
microaggressions [11].

[11] And ??: I do really appreciate your readership and your comments on
my essays when we chat.

[12] That's my attempt to say "I'm sorry if I didn't use you as one of
the examples.  Please do take the time to send in a comment."

[13] There is no endnote number 13.

[14] The other RS also says "It's sad that Rebelsky is not competent
enough of a writer to be able to be able to reproduce my tone effectively."

[15] I'm pretty sure I got the letters in the right order.  JNLD looks
wrong.  But then so does DJLN

[16] Hmmm ... were those examples too snarky?  Probably.  But I'm not sure if
I'm being snarky to my readers or snarky to myself, so I think I'll leave
them as is.

[17] Yes, I know that we established long ago that my sense of humor
bears almost no resemblance to a normal sense of humor.

[18] What?  You think *I* should be responsible for the reflections in
the one hundredth essay?  Nah.  I reflect on my writing at the end of
each month, and often multiple times in between.  I'm reserving this
one for you.

[19] And, as we saw last summer, there's no guarantee that I'll keep up 
my pace.

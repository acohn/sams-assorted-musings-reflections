_The Last Days of Jack Sparks_
==============================

*Topics/tags: [Reviews](index-reviews), short*

While I was on vacation, I read a few books.  One of the first books
I read was _The Last Days of Jack Sparks_ by Jason Arnopp.  I'm not
sure why I bought the book.  Okay, that's not quite true.  I know why
I bought the book.  It was on sale for $2.99 on Kindle and it had been
on my want list.  So what I'm not quite sure about is why it was on my
want list.  In particular, it's a horror novel, which is not generally
a genre I read [1].

My guess is that it ended up on my list of potential things to read
because it's a style of fiction I enjoy; something that claims to be a
"found" manuscript with additional annotations.  I like the concept
of books with additional "meta stories", as it were [2].  How did I
learn about it?  I must have read a review somewhere [3].  Ah!  I found
the likely culprit; [a _New York Times_ collection of reviews of recent 
fantasy and science fiction](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/books/review/the-latest-in-science-fiction-and-fantasy.html) [4].  The review notes that,

> this story is hyperbolic, a hypertextual mingling of narrative
with epistolary text messages and emails, transcribed interviews,
fourth-wall-breaking "notes" and other interruptions involving the
hapless editors, agents and roommates who have to put up with Jack.

Yeah, that sounds like something I'd add to my "to read" list.  I think
the reviews also commented on the humor, which is something I appreciate
in my meta-fiction.

The story is about Jack Sparks, a somewhat Hunter Thompson-esque
literary who gets way too involved in what he writes about.  His last
book was about drug cultures.  And yes, he seems to have tried them all.
This manuscript is about his explorations of the occult, explorations
that primarily come from his stance as a non-believer.  But we encouter
scene after scene after scene in which it seems like the occult may
be real.

I did not find the majority of the book all that scary; perhaps I've just
been desensitized by modern society.  But it was engaging and a fun read.
Then came the epilogue, written as a commentary on the primary manuscript
by the author's estranged brother.  It provided enough back story about
some unexplained things earlier in the book that, if taken at face value,
made it much more terrifying, at least to me.  Reading the postscript
almost makes me want to read the whole thing, just to encounter the book
with that additional context in mind.  We'll see if I find the time.

All in all, I found that _The Last Days of Jack Sparks_ was a successful
version of a form of story I enjoy.  There was less of the "meta writing"
than I'd like, but what was there worked well, particularly at the end.
And, throughout, the story kept me engaged.  It wasn't as funny as I'd
expected, but there were some bits of humor.

I'd recommend it as a light read, at least if you like horror.

Postscript: You know those reviews that are less about the work
being reviewed and more about the reviewer?  Yeah, I think this
is one of those.  That's okay.  You can read the review in [_The New York
Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/books/review/the-latest-in-science-fiction-and-fantasy.html).  Perhaps my notes provide some useful information.
Perhaps not.

[1] Back when Michelle lived in Maine and I lived in New Hampshire,
I'd listen to Steven King novels during the long drives back and forth.
But I've read few horror novels since then.

[2] I wanted to say "I like books with additional 'meta stories'".
However, my experience with such books is mixed.  While I like the
concept in the abstract, there are certainly times in which I find
that it does not work out well in practice.

[3] I don't read all that many reviews.  I try to keep up with the
Charles de Lint column in _Fantasy and Science Fiction_, although I
must admit that I've fallen behind on that.  I sometimes read the "Books"
section of _The New York Times_.

[4] The review also explains why Peter S. Beagle's _Summerlong_ is on
my "books to look for list"; I thought Amazon was just confused about
the Dean Bakopoulos book I'd added to my list [5].

[5] Which reminds me ....

Letters to colleagues
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short, things I was writing anyway*

Somewhat recently, I was [musing about courses I'd like to take
next semester](choosing-courses-2019-11-18).  Today, I decided to
follow up on that musing and ask two colleagues whether I could
audit their courses [1].

The first message went to Justin Thomas, in Theatre and Dance [2].

> Dear Professor Thomas,

> I am a faculty member at Grinnell College.  As you may know, I am interested in the intersection of computing technology and the arts and address that intersection in my scholarship and my teaching, both in computer science and in technology studies.  Hence, I appreciate seeing that you are offering a special topics course, THD-295-02, in Digital Media Design.  I note that there are still spaces available in the course.   Having attended some of your lectures in the past, I am confident that being in your course would help me expand my ways of thinking about technology.  If spaces remain at the start of spring semester, would you permit me to audit the course?

> I will do as much of the work as you suggest and will attend regularly, except on those occasions when external forces require me to be elsewhere (e.g., I have a conference, a review at Oberlin, and a parents' weekend scheduled).  I can either participate actively or try to stay quiet, as you prefer.

> You may be concerned about adding a faculty member to the mix of students in the class.  I will note that I have successfully taken or audited courses in the past, including Jeremy Chen's Introduction to the Studio and Sculpture, and the students seem to have been happy to see a faculty member struggle along with them.

> While I have not taken THD-115, I do have the equivalent of at least second-year standing, which I understand to be the alternate prerequisite for the course.

> I would be happy to address any other questions or concerns you may have.

> Thank you for your consideration.

> -- SamR

I'm an idiot, so I neither proof-read the message nor consulted
Grammarly about the content.  Still, I think it's okay as it is.
But what really makes me an idiot is that I got the course number
wrong in the subject line of the message, "Permission to Audit
THD-205-02".  I hope Justin will understand.

My next message went to Ralph Savarese in our Department of English.
I didn't proof-read that message, nor did I use Grammarly.  I did,
however, expand some of the sections that I'd included in the message
to Justin.  And I got the subject line right.

> Dear Professor Savarese,

> I am a faculty member at Grinnell College.  I would like to work on my writing skills, particularly for creative nonfiction.  Hence, I am interested in auditing ENG-207, The Craft of Creative Nonfiction.  I notice, with some surprise, that there are still spaces available in the course.  I know that your thoughtful approach and careful critiques would improve my writing.  If spaces remain at the start of spring semester, would you permit me to audit the course?

> I will do as much of the work as you suggest and will attend regularly, except on those occasions when external forces require me to be elsewhere (e.g., I have a professional meeting, a review at Oberlin, and a parents' weekend scheduled).  I can either participate actively in class sessions or try to stay quiet, as you prefer.

> You may be concerned about adding a faculty member to the mix of students in the class.  I'll admit that I have concerns, too, but likely different concerns than you do.  (E.g., I'm concerned that I will write less well than the other students.) I will note that I have successfully taken or audited courses in the past, including Jeremy Chen's Introduction to the Studio and Sculpture, and in both courses the students seem to have been happy to see a faculty member work alongside them.

> I must admit that have taken neither ENG-205, The Craft of Fiction nor ENG-206, The Craft of Poetry, which I understand are the preferred prerequisites for the course.  However, I have been writing for some time and I teach writing as part of Grinnell's Tutorial.  I also took "Little Red Schoolhouse" at the University of Chicago as well as five or so courses in Chicago's English Department.  I would hope that background will prepare me for the rigors of your course.

> I would be happy to address any other questions or concerns you may have.

> Thank you for your consideration.

Is auditing a good idea?  It will certainly take some time, time
to attend the courses and to do the work.  But it will be time that
is not only productive, but also good for my well being.  As I said
to Justin, thinking about computing and technology is core to my
current work.  MIST, the Mediascheme version of CSC 151, and the
Craft of Code Camps all fall at the boundary of computing and
technology.  As you, my readers, know well, I also need to work on
my creative writing skills.  I know that I would benefit from someone
who is as thoughtfully critical as Ralph.  Plus, he's chosen a set
of readings about disability for the course, which I expect will
enhance my understanding of that important area.

While both courses will take time away from my primary projects,
both will also contribute to the quality of those projects.  The
trade-off seems worth it.

Um ... I said "not only productive, but also good for my well being".
I'm pretty sure that what I just wrote only indicated why the classes
will be productive.  Why will it be good for my well being?  Learning
is always good for my well being.  Plus, it sounds like both courses
will involve creativity, and Michelle tells me that I'm rarely as
happy as when I'm being creative.

So, that's where we stand.  I've asked to be in both courses.  I'm not
sure if either or both will say yes.

[1] Traditionally, we might "sit in" on each others' courses.  But I
understand that the College now asks that anyone who regularly attends
a course register as an auditor.  I know there's some underlying rationale,
but I don't recall what it is.

[2] The College uses THD as an abbreviation for Theatre and Dance.
I must admit that my brain normally goes to "Theatrical Design"
when I see the abbreviation, even though I am a huge fan of Grinnell's
Dance Program.  But now I'm wondering whether people pronounce it "Thud".

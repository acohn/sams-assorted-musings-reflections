Writer's block
==============

*Topics/tags: [Writing](index-on-writing), [autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

Yesterday, I wrote [a draft of a potential project description for the
new CSC 151](fundhum-project-00).  That draft, although very rough,
was still remarkably hard to write.  I had trouble getting text down.
I rewrote many parts multiple times.  I threw away and rearranged things.
And, in the end, it's nothing special.

I'm not entirely sure why it was so hard to write.  It may be that I'm
planning on sharing it in the Obermann discussion group in a few days,
and so I'm worried about the reception of the material.  It may be
that I still don't feel like I have a deep enough sense of the course.
It may be that I'm finding writing hard in general.

As I've said in my recent musings on writer's block, the experience feels
new.  While I sometimes struggle when writing research papers, I've generally
been able to "churn out" instructional material at a pretty good pace.
Right now, it's much harder to write instructional text now than it
used to be.  But it's not all of my writing; I'm still able to muse with
some frequency.  Are the musings at fault?  Perhaps they have caused me
to set a higher bar for my regular writing [1,2].  Perhaps I'm spending
too much time writing less formally, and that affects my ability to write
more formally.  I'm not sure.

I had thought that one of my main obstacles was that I was spending too
much time on code, either sample Racket code or additional code for the
formatting system I'm using.  But I wrote the draft project description in
Markdown, and it involves no code.  So, while the coding may be getting
a bit in the way, it's not the primary factor [3].

Or perhaps I'm struggling with the same thing I regularly see students
struggle with: When you don't understand a subject well, it's harder to
write (well) about it.  I've always written instructional materials with
a sense that I'm learning while writing.  But maybe a combination of an
internal change in standards and less familiarity with the material is
causing some difficulty.  However, I'm even struggling to write about
Scheme concepts that I've taught for more than twenty years.

At the same time, I've realized that I'm ignoring one of the principles
of agile programming: _Write for the problem at hand, not the problem
you anticipate in the future.  You can always generalize later._  I find
that I'm regularly asking myself how I should make the textbook appropriate
for more than just Grinnell students.  And that takes time.  I need to
get the Grinnell-specific version done first and then go back and generalize
it later.  I should also apply that attitude more generally.  That is, I
should get something reasonable done and then go back and make the other
changes I'm anticipating, such as rearranging topics or refining examples.

I'm getting older [4], so it may be that I am not able to work as
efficiently.  Certainly, I've never been as productive as I was early
in my career.  I still don't understand how I got so much done.  But I
worked reasonably efficiently on the data science materials two years
ago, and my productivity should not have fallen off that much in those
two years.

It may be that my anxiety about the state of the world, the state of
the College, the state of the department, and the state of my family
are all affecting my writing.  Each day seems to raise another 
depressing or troublesome issue.

I've always claimed that I work best under pressure, so it may be that
I'm missing the tight deadlines that often accompany my writing.  If it's
Sunday night, students need to read something for Wednesday's class,
and a colleague needs a chance to review them before the students read
them, then I have no option other than to write (something*.  If
it's not due until next semester, there's less urgency.  However,
the project description should have led to a similar sense of urgency.
I need it ready by Monday morning for Wednesday's Obermann discussion,
so there is actual time pressure.

There are, of course, way too many distractions.  I am, as we all know,
[overcommitted](index-overcommitment).  Hence, I'm not able to focus as
much on writing as I'd like.  And I've found too many days when
I sit down to work on my writing only to discover an "urgent" task that
distracts me for a few hours.  That uses up mental energy.  And, in some
cases, those tasks also affect my mood.  But I struggle on days in which
tasks don't interfere, too.

How do I move forward?  I'm not sure.  It may be time to start
experimenting with free writing.  Or maybe I'll just keep plugging along
and hope that things start to click.

Postscript: I apologize for so many musings about writer's block.  But
writer's block is my primary experience these days [5] and I remain
hopeful that by writing about my writer's block, I'll unblock myself.
At the very least, it means that I've written *something*.

Postscript: I started this musing last night after finishing the draft
project description.  I wrote most of the musing this morning as I tried
to figure out how to deal with the frustrations I was still finding.
Then I wrote [an alternate project description](fundhum-project-01),
took a nap, and spent about six hours writing.  In that time, I completed
one reading and set up some apparatus for about four more.  In contrast,
I used to be able to write a reading and a lab in about three or four
hours.  Nonetheless, I've found a way to make forward progress.  It's just
slow forward progress.  Let's hope that I can continue to make some
progress by "just plugging along".  And let's hope that my pace can
accelerate.  We shall see.

[1] Given how much editing Janet had to do when I wrote the original
CSC 151 materials, that may be the case.

[2] It's kind of scary to think of my musings as setting a "high bar".
But the issue may be that, subconsciously, I know that my other writing
should be better than my musings.

[3] Upon further reflection, the issue with coding may be that it gives
me an out when I can't write.  If I can't write, I have things that I can
still do and feel productive.

[4] Aren't we all?

[5] There are also feelings of anxiety and sadness relating to the state
of our country.

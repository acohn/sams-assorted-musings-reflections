Writer's block

*Topics/tags: *

Yesterday, I wrote [a draft of a potential project description for the new
CSC 151].  That draft, although very rough, was remarkably hard to write.
I had trouble getting text down.  I rewrote many parts multiple times.
I'm not completely sure why it was so hard.  It may be that I'm planning
on sharing it in the Obermann discussion group in a few days.  It may be
that I still don't feel like I have a deep enough sense of the course.
It may be that I'm finding writing hard in general.

In any case, it's harder to write instructional text now than it used
to be.  I'm also finding it harder to write instructional text than
to muse.  Perhaps the musings have caused me to set a higher bar for my
regular writing.  Perhaps I'm spending too much time writing less
formerly.  I'm not sure.

I had thought that one of my main obstacles was that I was spending too
much time on code, either sample Racket code or additional code for the
formatting system I'm using.  But I wrote the draft project description in
Markdown, and it involves no code.  So, while the coding may be getting
a bit in the way, it's not the primary factor.

How do I move forward?  I'm not sure.  It may be time to start
experimenting with free writing.  I'll keep thinking.

Writer's block
==============

*Topics/tags: [Writing](index-on-writing), [Autobiographical](index-autobiograpical)*

Yesterday, I wrote [a draft of a potential project description for the
new CSC 151].  That draft, although very rough, was still remarkably
hard to write.  I had trouble getting text down.  I rewrote many parts
multiple times.  I threw away and rearranged things.  And, in the end,
it's nothing special.

I'm not completely sure why it was so hard to write.  It may be that I'm
planning on sharing it in the Obermann discussion group in a few days,
and so I'm worrying about the reception of the material.  It may be
that I still don't feel like I have a deep enough sense of the course.
It may be that I'm finding writing hard in general.

As I've said in my recent musings on writer's block, the experience feels
new.  While I sometimes struggle when writing research papers, I've generally
been able to "churn out" instructional material at a pretty good pace.
Right now, it's much harder to write instructional text now than it
used to be.  But it's not all of my writing; I'm still able to muse with
some frequency.  Are the musings at fault?  Perhaps they have caused me
to set a higher bar for my regular writing [1,2].  Perhaps I'm spending
too much time writing less formally and that affects my ability to do
more formal kinds of writing.  I'm not sure.

I had thought that one of my main obstacles was that I was spending too
much time on code, either sample Racket code or additional code for the
formatting system I'm using.  But I wrote the draft project description in
Markdown, and it involves no code.  So, while the coding may be getting
a bit in the way, it's not the primary factor [3].

Or perhaps I'm struggling with the same thing I regularly see students
struggle with: When you don't understand a subject well, it's harder to
write (well) about it.  I've always written instructional materials with
a sense that I'm learning while writing.  But maybe a combination of an
internal change in standards and less familiarity with the material is
causing some difficulty.  However, I'm even struggling to write about
Scheme concepts that I've taught for more than twenty years.

It may be that I'm older and therefore work less efficiently.  Certainly,
I've never been as productive as I was early in my career.  I still don't
understand how I got so much done.  But I worked fairly efficiently on
the data science materials two years ago, and I my productivity should
not have fallen off that much in those two years.

It may be that my anxiety about the state of the world, the state of
the College, the state of the department, and the state of my family
are all affecting my writing.

It may be that I'm missing the tight deadlines that often accompany my
writing.  If it's Sunday night, students need to read something for
Wednesday's class, and a colleague needs a chance to review them before
the students read them, then I have no option other than to write 
(something*.  But if I just need to write something for next semester,
there's less urgency.  

However, the project description should have led to a similar sense
of urgency.  I need it ready for Wednesday's Obermann discussion, so
there is a real time pressure.

How do I move forward?  I'm not sure.  It may be time to start
experimenting with free writing.  I'll keep thinking.

[1] Given how much editing Janet had to do when I wrote the original
CSC 151 materials, that may be the case.

[2] It's kind of scary to think of my musings as setting a "high bar".
But the issue may be that, subconsciously, I know that my other writing
should be better than my musings.

[3] Upon further reflection, the issue with coding may be that it gives
me an out when I can't write.  If I can't write, I have things that I can
still do and feel productive.

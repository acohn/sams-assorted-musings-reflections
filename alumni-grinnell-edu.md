Bad Software Choices #3128: alumni.grinnell.edu
===============================================

Every day at work, I deal with someone else's bad software choice in
some situation or another.  And I don't really understand it.  I respect
the people who choose much of our software.  But they make some very
interesting decisions about software.  Is it that people don't know what
software should be like?  Is it just that we move from really mediocre
software to less mediocare software?  I don't know.  But I still have
to deal with it.  And it frustrates me.  (I think it frustrates other
people, too.)

So, let's look at one of our newest Web sites, alumni.grinnell.edu.  It
replaces forum.grinnell.edu, which replaced loggia.grinnell.edu.  (Yes,
I also find it strange that we feel we have to regularly upgrade our
alumni site, and hire a different vendor to build it from scratch.)  I
love my colleagues in Development and Alumni Relations.  I've served on
committees with their lead tech person, and their lead tech person is
smart and thoughtful.

But then there's alumni.grinnell.edu.  What's wrong with it?  Almost
everything, from the design to the software logic and beyond.

*Hmmm ... maybe this essay is a bad idea.*

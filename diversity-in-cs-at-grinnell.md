Our [1] general focus in developing diversity has been to provide a 
welcoming department, one that considers and values diversity.  Across the
years, we've adopted techniques shown to be more inclusive (e.g., we've
been using active learning strategies since before I came to Grinnell; we
adapted the Georgia Tech "Media Computation" approach for our introductory
course); we've worked to have a diverse and excellent group of peer
educators (and to convince the College to support our peer educator
program); we've supported students in activities that build confidence
and a sense of belonging, supporting both student groups and trips to
the Grace Hopper Celebration and the Tapia Celebration; and we've shown
that we value diversity in our actions and in the topics we choose for
CS table, our weekly discussion group.

In some ways, we've been relatively successful.  Grinnell currently has
about 40% women majors [2], and we've grown our number of women majors at
the same time that we've grown our overall number of majors, so we can be
pretty sure that the growth of women has not been at the expense of men.
But you know what?  I don't think it's any one thing the faculty has
done that led to this growth, and it's not even every thing the faculty
has done.  Rather, we built a small cadre of majors who cared about these
issues (both men and women), and they worked hard to encourage others to
consider CS and to include others in the department.  In some ways, I think
we reached a form of "critical mass".  This achievement doesn't mean that
we no longer need to worry about these matters; too often, 

we've revamped our curriculum to incorporate research findings
on s
the years

[1] I say "Our" because the members of my department have collaborated
on these issues.

[2] Nationally, it's under 20%.

Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Rachel Heck Rose '01
==================================================================

There are a whole host of reasons that Rachel Rose '01 is both cool
and awesome [1]. As an undergraduate, she lived in Pirate House. She
married a druid [2]. She developed the first online version of
[Plans](grinnell-plans.html).  She gave an SRO [4] talk at an
international conference while still an undergraduate.  She was on
an SRO panel at GHC 2016.  She's made a promotional video for Day of
Code or Girls Who Code or Code.org, or some combination thereof [5].
Her name appears in the credits of _Rogue One: A Star Wars Story_,
and many other movies.  She's married to a vintner [6].  She's raising
awesomely cute kids [7].  And oh, so much more.

So let me tell you a bit more about Rachel.

---

[1] Or perhaps awesomely cool.

[2] Jack the Druid, to be precise [3].

[3] Or imprecise. My mind tends to distort things.

[4] "Standing Room Only", not "Sam Rebelsky's Opinion".

[5] Sorry Rachel.  As I said, my mind tends to distort things.

[6] No, she didn't marry twice. The Druid is now a vintner.

[7] Yes, I'd say that about a man, too.

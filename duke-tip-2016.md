A speech to Duke TIP award winners
==================================

*For some reason, Grinnell invited me to give a speech to Duke
TIP scholars on Tuesday, 3 May 2016.  Duke TIP recognizes strong
seventh grade students, often basing its recognition on performance on
standardized tests.  I didn't get a lot of instructions, but I'm told
that I'm supposed to give an "inspirational" speech.*

Good afternoon.  As Joe said, my name is Sam Rebelsky and I teach
computer science (and many other things) at Grinnell.  Congratulations
to you and your parents for your academic successes!  You should be very
proud of your achievements.

I must admit that it's a bit weird to be up here in front of this
audience.  All three of my sons were Duke TIP scholars, and so I'm much
more accustomed to being on the other side of the podium.  Lecturing is
also not my normal mechanism for teaching, since I think students learn
better by doing.  I'm also not sure that I've ever read my speech before.
But I've been asked to lecture, and so I will.  I'll do my best to use
your time well.

I have a few recommendations for you. I'll do my best to explain
each in turn.

I think Grinnell asked me to be up here because I represent a certain
kind of success.  I have an awesome job.  I get to make a difference
in the lives of my students.  I get to work on interesting projects,
projects that I often design.  I get paid well.  And I get to watch my
students go off to do incredible things, from helping design parts of
Twitter to writing the code that lets Disney and Industrial Light and
Magic create awesome animations, to making people laugh on the *Silicon
Valley* TV show, to working on medical softare, and more.

My own occupation and that list of occupations lead to  my first
recommendation for you: *Pursue your passions*.  Each of my students has
found something different that is important to him, her, or zir.  Most of
them are privileged enough to make a good living do what is important.
(Others do what they are good at, and use their income to make it
possible for them to spend time on what they value.)  I can tell you
that while all of my three sons were Duke TIP scholars, each is looking
in a different direction.  My eldest is likely to be a "Quant", someone
who applies mathematics to solving a wide variety of applied problems.
But he's also thinking about teaching.  My youngest son, who is ninth
grade, already programs better than many of my students.  But he thinks
he wants to pursue music, since it calls to him.

My middle son, who is just starting college, has no idea what he wants
to do.  He's talked about being a priest, a human rights lawyer, and
a fireworks manufacturer, among other things.  Of course, he's also
talked about being a "trophy husband".  So he really doesn't know,
and it's okay that he's still exploring.  I'll tell you that my oldest
son originally thought he'd be a chemist, and I thought I'd be an
archaeologist.  Part of young adulthood is figuring out your passions.
And that's my second recommendation for you: *Take the time to figure
out what you are passionate about.*  You may not know that until midway
through college, or beyond.

And that leads to my third recommendation, *Don't focus on just one thing.*
No matter what your primary passion is, you will do it better if you can
draw on other skills, knowledge, and approaches.  As a computer scientist,
it's still important that I write well.  I also draw upon things I learned
in studio art as I do work.  I'm a bit envious as I watch my children
draw upon the cooperative skills they learned in team sports.  Each thing
you do can contribute to your success, so try a lot of different things.

Many of you worked very hard to get here.  And I very much congratulate
you on that; knowing how to work hard is an incredibly important skill.
However, for others, it likely came easy.  And for you, I will share my
own story.  Like you, I as a smart kid, and things came easily to me.
Things came easily in grade school.  Things came easily in high school.
Things even came relatively easy to me in College, and I attended the
University of Chicago, one of the most challenging schools in the nation.
My wife was envious that I always seemed to have time to go book shopping,
to work as a Calculus tutor, to work for our film society and attend or
run daily film showings, to work late nights in the computing center,
and more.  I'll tell you it was great.  And then I hit graduate school.
And I realized that I could no longer get along on just intellect, and
didn't have the skills I needed to succeed.  I didn't know how to buckle
down and get work done; I was too used to just dashing off an answer.
And it therefore took me about two years longer than it should have to
finish graduate school.  I wish I had learned good work habits earlier.
And so these are particularly personal recommendations: *Learn how to
organize yourself.*  *Figure out how to buckle down and get work done,
even if it's not always pleasant work.*  And to do those things, you may
need to *challenge yourself, even if others do not challenge you.*  I
wish I'd done all of those things, and I strongly encourage you to do so.

My previous recommendations have been primarily about you, and how you
might succeed.  My next recommendation is therefore somewhat different.
*Take responsibility for others.*  As some of our brightest citizens, you
will take on leadership roles.  You may develop ideas and products that
can change the world.  Take your successes and use them to help others -
serve as a mentor, a tutor, a guide.  I know that I find helping others
to be one of the most rewarding things I do, and I hope that you'll find
the same.

We have almost reached the end of my remarks.  It's therefore time for my
penultimate recommendation.  (I know all of you know what "penultimate"
means, but let me explain to your parents.  Penultimate means "next to
last".  We use the more confusing term to make ourselves sound smarter.)
I think Joe might try to fire me if I didn't say "*When you're looking at
colleges in a few years, consider Grinnell.*"  Grinnell permits you to
explore a wide variety of interests, exposes you to new and challenging
ideas, provides you with committed faculty and other resources, and
gives you a set of interesting and talented peers to work with.  (Joe,
did I do okay?)

My final recommendation is to *be proud of yourselves*.  Few students
achieve your level of academic achievement, and you should take the
time to congratulate yourselves.

Thank you for taking the time to listen.  I look forward to seeing you
receive your awards,  I also hope you enjoy the rest of your visit.

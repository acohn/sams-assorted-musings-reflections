A semester of a coat and a tie
==============================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), rambly [1]*

Today was the last day of classes of the semester.  As best I recall,
I wore a coat and a tie every work day of the semester [2].  But it's
almost certainly time to stop.  It's one thing to wear a coat and a tie
[3] when it's winter or early spring.  It's another when my classroom
is generally at or above 75 degrees Fahrenheit and I generally have an
exothermic metabolism.

Why did I wear a coat and tie each day?  I recall making the decision to
wear a coat and tie at the beginning of the semester, but I can't recall
the rationale.

One reason might have been so that I could more regularly make one of
my favorite "dad jokes": "Why are you wearing a tie?"  "I find the world
much more pleasant when I decrease the flow of oxygen to my brain."  But
I have a large enough repertoire of dad jokes that I don't really need
an excuse to add another one.

Another might have been that I wanted to provide a contrast to my hair,
which is now over a foot long, curly, and sometimes slightly matted,
and to my beard, which makes my hair look neat.  My subconscious might
have suggested to me that people treat someone with wild hair differently
when they are in a coat and tie.  I don't recall making that decision
consciously.  But, hey, I forget things.

Or perhaps it was in reaction to my decision to move forward about my
blue coat.  What about my blue coat?  I used to have a blue coat that I
loved.  But in my rush to leave the AP grading on my birthday last summer
I managed to leave it and some shirts behind.  The hotel promised to send 
them to me, but
but never did.  By the time it came back to mind, it seemed too late to
check again.  I didn't mind losing the coat so much; it's relatively
easy to replace a coat.  But I minded losing my ties.  I'd brought my
"college calculus course" tie, the tie that goes with my double-breasted
suit [4], and a few others.  It took me awhile to accept giving those
ties up for lost.  Eventually, I said to myself "That's okay, you can
find other interesting ties."  And so I went bargain tie shopping [5].
So perhaps I was wearing those new ties as a followup.  Or perhaps I
was wearing ties as an excuse to get more ties.

The good news is that midway through spring semester, I found a packet
of ties on top of my dresser.  It appears that I did bring some of my
ties back from the AP reading, including the calculus tie and the one
that goes with the suit.  I may have lost others, but it's unlikely that
they matter as much [6].

Somewhere through this musing, I said to myself "It's okay that you don't
remember exactly why you chose to wear a coat and a tie each day; you
[mused about this topic](coat-and-tie) at the start of the semester.
That will tell you why."  Let's see ... what did I write?

> Every five or so years, I decide to wear a sport coat and tie to work
each day.  There's usually no particular motivating factor; something
in my brain says "You should wear a coat and a tie."  I like ties; I can
wear bright and flashy things and I get to cut off the flow of oxygen
to my brain.  I find life more pleasant that way.

> I'm always interested to hear how people react.  "_Are you meeting with
someone?_" "Nope, I just decided to wear a coat and tie."  "_Why are you
wearing a suit?_"  "I'm not.  It's a sport coat." "_What's the special
occasion?_" "There isn't one."

Um ... I guess there wasn't a reason.  My subconscious was just telling
me to do so.

I'm still interested to hear how people react.  I wore the coat and tie
every day I was at work this semester [8].  But as recently as last week,
people asked me whether I had a special meeting [9] and someone else
called me dapper.  I have trouble thinking of myself as dapper.  I much
prefer the comment that someone made yesterday: "Sam, you look kempt."
That, I'll accept.

Will I repeat this practice?  Almost certainly.  I'm debating whether I'll
wear a coat and a tie when I'm doing my fellowship at UIowa.  It strikes
me that having that style would be appropriate there.  I'm not sure
whether or not I'll have the energy to continue the practice next spring.
We shall see.

Postscript: In addition to being the last day of the semester, today is
the 39th anniversary of my father's death.  My father had the kind of
job that normally expects ties [10]; I'm pretty sure that he did not
wear them regularly.  Male faculty rarely wear ties [11].  I've been
wearing one every day.  I don't know what to make of that.

[1] I had orignally tagged this as "short, rambly".  I then asked "Can a 
musing be both short and rambly?"  I also answered "We shall see."  In
the end, the musing wasn't as short as I planned.  But it remained about
as rambly as I expected.  It still remains to be seen whether I can write
a short and rambly musing.

[2] There was one week day that I spent home in bed.  I didn't put on
a coat and a tie.  But I don't count a sick day as a work day.

[3] And a button down shirt and an undershirt.

[4] I don't currently fit in my double-breasted suit.  But when I do,
I have a tie that works perfectly.  I use it for other reasons, too.

[5] Most of my favorite ties came from a sale rack that I visited whenever
I went to DC to review grants for the NSF.  I think they were something
like 3 for $30.  But the program no longer uses that hotel and I don't
review grants as much.  These days, I find the ties that I like at 
Goodwill; given my penchant for strange patterns, I assume that I save
most of my ties from the "we've had it for more than three months; it's
time to discard it" bin.

[6] Hopefully, I won't now realize that I'm missing another special tie.
The tie I care most about is a tie of my father's that is black except
for one rainbow-colored line; I call it his "Pink Floyd tie" because it
looks like the right side of _Dark Side of the Moon_.  The tie is a 
little small for me, but it's special to me.  Of course, I currently
have no idea where that tie is [7], but I'm pretty sure that it didn't
go with me to the reading.

[7] The kids sometimes borrow it.  Ties also seem to migrate around our
closet.

[8] I also wore the coat and tie at SIGCSE.  I'm not sure whether or
not that counts as "at work".  I tried wearing them during the first
day of spring break, when we visited Harvey Mudd.  The coat and tie
were a bit warm for California weather.

[9] One of my thoughtful colleagues suggested a response: "Yes, I"m meeting
a lot of special people; I'm teaching today." or "Yes, I'm meeting my
students."

[10] Toward the end of his life, he was a VP at Polaroid.

[11] I'd say that less than one in ten of my male colleagues in the
sciences seems to wear a tie each day.

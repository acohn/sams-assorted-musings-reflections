The other day, I attended a Q&A period with Stanford's president.  At
some point, possibly when discussing alcohol use, he said something like,
"We've pulled a lot of levers, but it hasn't made a difference."  I thought,
"Mike spent a lot of time talking about levers."

This past Friday, we received the agenda for Monday's Faculty Meeting.
In it was a section on the metrics that the Trustee Academic Affairs
Committee received [1].  At one time, we would have called that a
"Dashboard".  My brain even suggested that's how it appeared in the
agenda; however, when I went back to the agenda, I discovered that my 
brain was wrong.

It may not surprise you to hear that I dislike both metaphors,
particularly the "levers" metaphor, especially when it is applied
to ways in which we encourage students to behave differently.
Perhaps it's just me, but I find the overall mechanistic approach
troubling.  People are not machines and you shouldn't treat them
as such or think about them as such.  I worry that these metaphors,
like the bean counting I often decry, makes us sound like what one
of my colleagues once referred to as "a sausage-making machine".  That
metaphor came from the time in which NCA/HLC asked us to talk about
our inputs and outputs, but it's the same general approach.

But we're talking about people, not machines.  Amazingly, people
do not behave like machines [2].  Pulling the same "lever" on two
different people will likely have different effects.  Consider, for
example, one of my personality traits that too often leaks into my
teaching, sarcasm.  For some students, my painful sarcasm is one
of the reasons they love taking classes from me.  For a few, it's
terrifying, a reason to consider avoiding CS.  In recent years, I've 
worked hard to restrain my sarcasm in class, but have not always been
successful.

Whoops.  Time to return from that detour.  In any case, thinking
about my sarcasm as a "lever" I can use to increase or decrease the
number of CS majors seems wrong.  Given that the ratio of "like"
to "dislike" for that trait seems to be high, dialing it up [3]
might increase the number of folks who take more classes in CS or
take my classes or some such.  But it will lose me some people who
I would likely appreciate having in my classes and in the major.
If we just think about it as a lever, we won't think about who
they are.  And we won't really think about them as individuals.

Particularly since Grinnell promotes the individually advised
curriculum and "individually advised education" [4], using a metaphor
and approach that treats folks as a group, rather than individuals,
is wrong.  It would be wrong even if we did not emphasize these
things.

I do, of course, realize that most folks on campus understand that
a mechanistic approach is wrong.  Most of our recent student studies
involve a significant qualitiative component [5].  And, when folks
were talking about dashboards, they did note that the dashboard was
not intended to provide complete information; rather, it was to
guide folks toward areas that seemed to need further exploration.
I must also admit that I find these kinds of data useful to initiate
a series of questions: Why is this happening?  What else can we
find out about it?  How do we address underlying or related issues?

Nonetheless, language has power.  Metaphors shape the way we think.
If we use metaphors like "lever" and "dashboard", we subtly encourage
ourselves and others to move away from a humanistic understanding
toward a much more mechanistic model.

I'm glad the Trustees are using "metrics".  I'm glad that I have
not yet heard the term "lever" from Dean Harris.  Her fondness for
Towers of Babel and rhizomes strikes me as much more promising.

[1] Someone probably should have warned AIR that this was being released,
since people like me often send out questions when they see data.

[2] Machines also do not behave like people.

[3] How's that for mixing metaphors.

[4] The sign at the Des Moines airport says "A guided, individualized
experience for the intellectually engaged".

[5] Thanks to the awesome folks in AIR for that, particularly the one
most often tasked with handling interviews.

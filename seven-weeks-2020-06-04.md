The pandemic has led to many schools considering a wide variety of
options for Fall 2020.  Many small liberal arts colleges, including
many members of our peer group, and likely including Grinnell, are
looking at splitting our fourteen-week semesters into two seven-week
units.  Students will take approximately two courses each of these
units.  As far as I can tell, no one has quite settled on a name.
They aren't "blocks", like those used at Colorado College and Cornell
College [1]; blocks are usually 3.5 weeks.  They aren't quarters,
like those used at the University of Chicago, Dartmouth, and Stanford.
Quarters are traditionally nine or ten weeks long.  "Unit" is too
vague.  "Term", which I heard someone use yesterday, is often
interchangeable with "semester".  So I'm calling a seven-week course
unit a "semisemester" (half semester, which is arguable a quarter)
or "septiseptem" (seven weeks, or seven sevens).  But the name isn't
all that important.  What's the saying?  "A rose's thorn, by any
other name, would also draw blood."  Something like that.  In any
case, it's going to hurt.

The issue I'm hearing from most of my colleagues at Grinnell and
elsewhere is how we are to convert our fourteen-week classes to
seven-week classes.  Many administrators seem to think that it's
not going to be that big a deal [2].  In some cases, that may be
true.  But I'm struggling to understand how to do the conversion,
particularly if our goal is to provide online or socially distanced
classes that are as close to as good as standard Grinnell classes
as we can get.  A lot of things change when you cut down to seven
weeks.

There's less time for students to pause and reflect.  I know that
for hard CS and math problems (and many others), you need to work
on the problem for a while and then take some time away to let your
subconscious work on ideas.  Pushing ahead is a waste of time.  But
if your time between classes is cut down, and due dates are
accelerated, when do you get to pause?  And when do you get to pause
for wellness?  Most semesters have some ebb and flow.  I'm pretty
sure that we'll be moving at a fast pace for the full seven weeks.

One of my offspring noted that this pace will be particularly
problematic for students in these two-course septisepta.  Why?
Even though each four-credit Grinnell course is nominally 180 hours
of work across the semester, you can usually identify one course
that will take you a bit less work; perhaps you read more quickly
than other students, so one of your classes is reading intensive;
perhaps you seem faster at math, so one of your classes involves a
lot of mathematical manipulation.  You balance your three harder
courses with that one less-time-consuming course.  But that won't
work when you're only taking two courses.  And yes, I do think
that's a consideration when we convert our classes; at least for
the time being, we need to be thinking about the 180 hours as an
upper-bound, and not so much as an average.  Can we do that?  It
will be hard, particularly since we won't have a good sense of
workload.

Faculty will need to provide feedback much more quickly, particularly
for scaffolded assignments.  If, say, I had a draft due on one
Tuesday and the revision due the following Tuesday, I'd be pretty
comfortable getting comments back to the student on Thursday or
Friday.  Now that we're cutting the timetable in half, a draft due
on Tuesday would likely have the revision due on Friday, which means
that the student probably needs comments by Wednesday.  I suppose
we could have the draft due on Wednesday, provide the comments by
Friday, and expect the revision by Monday, but that assumes that
the student can work over the weekend, and considerations of equity
suggest that we should not assume that students have all of their
weekends free.

More broadly, we will have to figure out new rhythms for our classes
and our assignments.  I know that getting rhythms right can be hard;
often what you think will work right doesn't.  Rhythms will also
be different for students who are online.  It's complex.  I expect
most of us will need to make significant changes to what my assignments
look like and how they build on each other.

Then there's the question of how often we meet.  At least at Grinnell,
we haven't been told.  One of my colleagues suggested that the
natural thing would be to "double up" each class, offering it in
both morning and afternoon.  For example, a class that meets at 8 am
MWF in the fall would now meet at 8 am and 1 pm in the first fall
block.  A class that meets 10 am TuTh would meet at 10 am and 3 pm on
TuTh.  A class that meets at 1 pm every day would now meet at 8 am and
1 pm in the second fall block.  And so on and so forth.  There are
some problems with this model; students won't have much time between
their two same-day sessions, so we won't be able to expect them to
get much work done.  And it probably won't work with labs.  The
other suggestion is that we will have most classes meet five days
per week, possibly for a bit more time.

I worry about the math for the second model.  Most of my classes
meet three days per week [3].  Most of my introductory classes meet
three days per week for eighty minutes each day.  Fourteen weeks
of three classes per week totals forty-two classes.  Seven weeks of
five classes per week totals thirty-five classes.  What happens to the
content of the missing seven classes?  I don't think I should teach
about 17% less material; subsequent classes count on material from
prerequisite classes.  Rearranging the topics from forty-two
workshop-style classes is a non-trivial task; I suppose rearranging
materials from forty-two classes two thirty-five is a non-trivial
task in most situations.  I suppose I could teach on Saturdays (ugh)
or assign the equivalent of a class as weekend homework (also ugh,
and probably inequitable).  I wonder what the "best practices" 
recommendations will be.

I also wonder about language courses.  Latin, for example, meets five
days per week.  I don't think they will want to cram seventy classes
worth of material into thirty-five classes.  I also expect that human
brains need some time to process language.  On the other hand, it may be
that language becomes much more of an immersion-style experience.  I
don't envy my colleagues who have to figure that out.

I've been told that we should talk to people who already teach in
compressed periods, such as the folks at Colorado and Cornell
Colleges.  I'm not sure that it's all that helpful to talk to the
people who teach in block programs.  In general, they own their
students for the block.  If they want to meet at 9 am and 4 pm each
day, and give the students time in-between to work on problems,
they can.  If they want to hold the students from 9 am to noon and
give them the afternoons off, they can.  Or at least that's how I
understand block programs.  Maybe they have some restrictions.  In
any case, our students will probably be taking two or so classes
[4], so we will have to share them with others.  And what I've heard
from folks in block programs, at least those in some languages, is
that the amount they could teach online in a block was significantly
less than they could teach in person; in many cases, moving our
semester-long classes online for half a semester had only a minor
effect on the material we could cover.

Speaking of moving online, there's the whole issue of the software
needed to teach online.  I don't know what issues my colleagues in
other disciplines are considering, but I'm worrying about collaboration,
particularly collaboration for software development.  Pair programming
is a core part of what I do in my introductory classes and small-group
work is core to most of my upper-level classes.  I'm not as worried
about small-group work; it looks like Microsoft Teams or the
Blackboard Collaborate breakout feature will work.  It may be that
Microsoft VSCode will suffice for some situations; I've been told
that professional programmers partner while using it and appropriate
plugins.  That approach may work for CSC 161, which uses C, and CSC
207, which uses Java, but it won't work for CSC 151, which uses
Racket.  I *think* screen and keyboard sharing in Microsoft Teams
might work if we can work out the complexities.  I hear from colleagues
elsewhere that Repl.it is nice for quick discussions.  However,
Grinnell has imposed very restrictive policies on software.  We
need to go through a sometimes cumbersome process of an unknown
length [5].  I understand our desire for "technological minimalism",
but technology is integrated into my discipline, and I think we should
understand that it's appropriate to expect a bit more than minimalism
for computer science students.

I know my colleagues who teach CSC 161 are reflecting on the other
significant change for that course.  Thousands of hours have gone
into developing a curriculum centered around simple robots.  Some
of the time was on the software to support the robots and curriculum,
but a lot was also on the daily labs and readings.  Without the robots,
almost every bit of that curriculum has to change.  Would you want
to design a new framework for the class and write however-many labs
in a highly compressed time period?  I would not [6].

I also don't want to think of how my colleagues in the lab sciences
are going to adapt.  You learn things differently when you work
directly with your equipment and your subject matter; one of the
strengths of our science curriculum is how it provides such
opportunities.  I've been impressed to hear some of the things my
colleagues are considering for remote learning, ways they can send
lab materials home [7].  But teaching two labs per week, rather
than one?  That's intimidating, particularly if they are going to
happen in person.  Who is going to be able to get the lab spaces
and supplies reconfigured quickly enough for that turnaround?

The arts present another set of complex challenges, both in terms
of dealing with online learning and an accelerated time frame.  It
takes time to learn a technique, to experiment with the technique,
to create something, to create something better, to create something
good, to critique it, and so on and so forth.

I suppose everyone will face some challenges, or at least almost
everyone.

Let's return to the broader picture.  Folks in every discipline are
going to have to reconfigure their courses for septisepta [8].  It's
going to take a lot of effort.  You know what's especially frustrating?
It's effort that's unlikely to have long-term value.  In a half
year, or year, or two years, we'll return to semesters.  The time
spent restructuring courses?  It will have only been for this short
period.

When I've talked to colleagues about these issues, I've found that
everyone has these kinds of concerns.  But I've also been impressed
at how committed my Grinnell colleagues are to providing students
with the best classes they can, even though the preparation time
is, in effect, uncompensated labor [9,10].

I look forward to working together to figure out practices that we
can share and that will help us develop courses we can be proud of.

**_Postscript_**: I grew up in the quarter system.  That is, my
college used the quarter system, and the first institution I taught
at also used the quarter system.  With quarters, students usually
have between ten and twelve different courses each year and forty-two
over their undergraduate career. That makes Grinnell's eight courses
per year and thirty-two over four years seem a bit slim.  Part of
me wonders whether there might be some benefits to restructuring
Grinnell's curricula around septisepta, with perhaps three courses,
rather than two in each septiseptem.  We'd have to teach less, but
we might be able to bring more variety to students' experiences.

I was going to say that that approach would be an enormous amount
of work.  But it's not clear to me that redesigning classes to fit
a seven-week model with about two-thirds the work is any harder
than making them fit a seven-week model with the same work.  Of
course, we would also have to spend additional
effort to restructure majors and other expectations.

Perhaps the only one who would want to consider that approach.

[1] No, not Grinnell College.  Not Cornell University, either.

[2] That's not quite true.  There has been some discussion of providing
course releases to aid with the conversion.

[3] I believe the vast majority of Grinnell classes meet either three
days per week for fifty minutes or two days per week for either 80 or
110 minutes.

[4] Maybe an additional 2-credit class, or PE, or music lessons, or ....

[5] I've probably mentioned this policy before.  It is vague and comes
with too little ancillary information, such as which software is currently
approved.  I feel bad for my colleagues in ITS who must plow through the
many requests for software and the complaints from around campus; it 
does not feel like the policy stems from the folks who must implement it.
I've also found the folks I've dealt with in ITS quite cooperative.

[6] While I would not want to do that, I have, on occasion, put myself
in a situation in which I need to write large numbers of labs in a 
relatively short time frame.  But that time-frame was a semester, not
a semisemester.

[7] Only materials that they've determined students can work with safely
at home.

[8] If I'm calling a seven-week unit a "septiseptem", multiple units
become septisepta", right?

[9] Faculty have a nine-month contract that runs from the start of fall
classes to the end of spring classes.  We are not paid for this kind
of summer work.  That doesn't stop people from showing up for meetings
and discussions about teaching, or from spending time restructuring
their classes.

[10] Although they are doing class development and some additional
administrative work without compensation during the summer, many
faculty, at least many Grinnell faculty, are in significantly better
shape than those in other positions, particularly those in the host 
of essential, but poorly compensated, jobs in our area.

Plans for SIGCSE 2019
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Overcommitment](index-overcommitment), SIGCSE, things I wrote for other purposes*

The other day, I sent my Dean a type of email message that I send him once
or twice per year.  What type of message?  Read the first paragraph, and
you'll see the explanation.

> Dear Dean Latham,

> The Policy on Procedural Flexibility (p. 16 of the current [Faculty Handbook](http://web.grinnell.edu/dean/Handbook/FacultyHandbook.pdf)) indicates that "A faculty member should report to the Dean of the College any intention to leave the campus for any period which shall exceed two class days during the academic year."  I am writing to report my intention to leave the campus for two such periods.

> 1\. I will be attending the ACM FAT\* Conference on Fair, Accountable, and Transparent AI from Tuesday, 29 January 2019 to Thursday, 31 January 2019.  <https://fatconference.org/>.  My attendance at the conference is a followup to areas I've been exploring as a Digital Bridges Fellow.  For this trip, I will only miss one day of class (Wednesday, 30 January 2019) and I will arrange appropriate coverage for my classes.

> 2\. I will be attending the 50th Annual SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education from Tuesday, 27 February 2019 to Sunday, 2 March 2019.  <https://sigcse2019.sigcse.org/>.  I serve as one of the Student Volunteer Coordinators for that conference, helping manage the over 100 student volunteers that we rely upon.  I am also co-presenting a paper on Grinnell's CSC 321/22 courses and supporting my research students as they present [1] on their work.  (Traditionally, SIGCSE has about a 30% acceptance rate for papers, so my students' success in getting two papers accepted is quite good.)  I am participating in a panel on community outreach in computer science and a Birds-of-a-Feather session on computing for social good.  As Vice-Chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computers and Society (ACM SIGCAS), I expect to participate in yet-to-be-determined SIGCAS activities at the conference.  For this trip, I will miss two days of class (Wednesday and Friday).  I will arrange appropriate coverage for my classes.

What is the Policy on Procedural Flexibility?  It appears in Part One:
The Academic Organization of the College, Section IV. Faculty Duties
and Responsibilities, Subsection A. Teaching and reads as follows.

> 2\. Policy on Procedural Flexibility

> The number of credits a course receives at Grinnell College is not tied to the number of hours per week that the class meets. This arrangement permits variation in frequency and length of class meetings, depending upon the nature of the course and the level of the students in the course, and provisions for reading periods during which times classes may have irregular or no meetings, as well as flexibility in the use of texts and examinations. It does not mean, however, that the faculty member is not accessible to students in the course who may wish consultations on their reading and research projects for the course. A faculty member should report to the Dean of the College any intention to leave the campus for any period which shall exceed two class days during the academic year. The Dean has the right to refuse such leave when in the Deanâ€™s opinion, teaching will be unwarrantedly disrupted.

I'm not sure whether other faculty members follow the requirement that we 
report our anticipated absences; I expect that it falls in the fairly broad
category of "things that are in the handbook but don't seem to be common
practice" [2].  Nonetheless, I've tried to follow this practice.  

But that's not the topic of this musing.

As I was finishing the paragraph about SIGCSE, I said to myself "*What
were you thinking?*"  I've committed to a surprisingly large number of
activities at SIGCSE.  Given my experiences as SV co-chair last year, any
time I'm not at sessions in which I'm presenting, I'll need to be in the
SV coordinators office.  As I've said, I didn't expect all three papers
to be accepted.  I'd also put together a panel; I'm somewhat glad that it
was not accepted [4].  I can't back out of any of these responsibilities,
and, in the end, I'm happy to participate in all these activities.
But it will be an especially busy SIGCSE.

Maybe I'll make saner choices next year.

Postscript: I also need to find a way to get to Gloria Childress Townsend
and Mark Guzdial's keynotes.  Both have been great inspirations.

---

Postscript: Although I've committed to a lot at SIGCSE, I know that
it's less than Dan Garcia normally does and I expect it will be far
less than Colleen Lewis does.  They, and so many others, do so much
for our conference in a variety of ways, but particularly through great
presentations [5].  I don't know how they do it.

---

Postscript: This musing reminds me that I have to get cracking on the
SIGCSE Student Volunteers database.  The last time I tried to do anything,
it didn't work.  I'm a bit worried.

---

[1] I meant to write "as they present two papers on their work".  Oh well.
That issue is clarified.

[2] There's some evidence that our policy that faculty members share their
syllabi with the Department Chair was not followed regularly until the past
year or two.  I also know that whenever I mention my practice as Department
Chair of gathering feedback on teaching from the Student Educational Policy 
Committee (SEPC), people are surprised by that practice.  But the Handbook
does say that

> The Chair of the Department shall meet regularly with the departmental
Student Educational Policy Committee to obtain its impressions of the
department's programs and the performance of the department's
faculty members.  Such impressions should be reported, when appropriate,
to the faculty member concerned and to the Dean of the College. (p. 12
of the 4-18-2018 version of the handbook [3])

[3] There's a newer version of the handbook posted.  However, my
conversations with FOC members suggest that that handbook contains
incorrect text.  That may be a story for another day.

[4] I think it was a good panel, and the reviews were strong.  But that's
how things go sometimes.

[5] No, I'm not trying to suck up.   I don't gain anything from 
complementing Colleen and Dan.

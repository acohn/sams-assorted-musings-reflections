For some reason I don't quite understand, every month or two I get
a request to add a link to one of the pages I manage.  Here's a sample.

I got a followup a few days later

This pair is actually better than most, since it references a page
I've updated within the past year.  Often, the requests are for
ancient course pages from a decade or more ago.

I assume that messages like this must be automated.  It's not hard
to scrape my email address off of a page [1] and it's only slightly
harder to figure out my name.  Still, I am interested in the algorithm
they use to do the latter.  How do they pick the page?  I assume
they look for pages that have comparatively high page ranks.  But
I wouldn't expect mine to have a high rank for "federated learning",
whatever that is [2].

These kinds of messages seem to play on our sense of politeness;
it's only reasonable to write back and say "I'm sorry, but I'm not
interested in linking" or even to add the link to the page.  But
these requests are generally spam, so I treat these messages much
like I treat spam phone calls; I discard them as soon as I realize
that they are spam [3].

You know what?  It may be time to set up an official policy about
link requests.  Let's see ...

> **On link requests**

> I regularly receive requests to add links to my pages.  I charge
  a fee of $100 to consider such requests.  If I consider the link
  appropriate, I will be happy to negotiate a fee for adding the
  page.  Most fees are a minimum of $100, which represents my effort
  at adding the link.

  nonprofits, such as EFF or Creative Commons.

I'm going to add that to my home page.  Next, I need to figure out how to
add a link to that to all of my pages [4].

[1] Or, I suppose, to figure out my email address from the URL.

[2] Nope, I'm not going to bother to look it upon the Interweb.  Nor am I
going to follow the link they sent me, since that may tell them that I
read their email.

[3] I recall an interview with a telemarketer on NPR a decade or
more ago, which went something like this: "We rely on people being
polite.  Until you hang up on me, I'm going to keep trying to
convince you to buy our product".  Since hearing that, I'm perfectly
comfortable hanging up on telemarketers; it's actually better for them.
If I were a less nice person, I'd set up an AI voice response system.

[4] That's actually a useful exercise, since I should be updating all
of my pages in multiple ways, particularly when I am forced onto a new
server.  Among other things, I should add links to the College's
accessibility statement for Web pages [5], our [DMCA contact](https://www.grinnell.edu/digital-millennium-copyright-act-1998), and other similar things.  I
might also update my CC licenses to the latest versions.

[5] I had difficulty finding that.  I found the broader [Digital Accessibility
Policy](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2018-09/Digital%20Accessibility%20Policy%208-1-2018.pdf), but that's not really the same thing.  Our
[Web accessibility page](https://www.grinnell.edu/web-accessibility) is 
only applicable to the primary site.

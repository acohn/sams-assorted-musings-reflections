I love books.  I like reading them.  I like looking at the pictures.
I like the way that fiction takes me to new places and helps me
understand others.  I also like the way that nonfiction takes me
to other kinds of new places and helps me change how I think about
the world.  I particularly like scholarly books, at least scholarly
books that relate to professional interests.  What kinds of professional
interests?  All sorts.  Computing.  Diversity in computing.  Teaching.
Functional programming.  Arts and computing.  Writing.  [Constructionist
thinking](constructionism-2020-06-03).  Stuff like that.

Unsurprisingly, MIT press is one of my favorite publishers.  They publish
many of the core texts on Scheme, including _Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs_ (SICP) and _How To Design Programs_ (HTDP).  They
published many of the core books on Logo and constructionism, including
my beloved _Visual Modeling with Logo_ [1].  Perhaps most importantly,
they are the hosts of Leonardo, the center of most of the best work on
computing and the arts, or the arts and computing.

Some years, MIT press has some kind of sale in the spring.  Last year,
I think it was 50% off all titles.  This year, it seemed to be much more
limited.

But then I discovered something of a secret sale on Amazon.  A
variety of MIT Press books had dropped to $9.99.  I noticed the
change on my wishlist with [_Color for the
Sciences_](https://www.amazon.com/Color-Sciences-MIT-Press-Koenderink-ebook-dp-B00MHAUYC0/dp/B00MHAUYC0/),
which I ordered.  One or two other titles on my wishlist were also
on sale, but I found myself asking why they had ended up on my
wishlist and decided not to order them.

I tried looking for information and failed.  I think it's just that there
are a bunch of MIT press books that are being cleared out.  I looked
randomly for a bit (e.g., by listing MIT press books by price), but
then realized that I could do a Web search.  I can't quite recall
what I used, but it was something like

> site:amazon.com "MIT Press" "$9.99"

In any case, I found way too many interesting books.  Not all were in
stock, but they've been showing up in dribs and drabs over the past
few weeks.  What did I order?  Here's a sampling.

* [_Inventing the Charles River_](https://www.amazon.com/Inventing-Charles-River-MIT-Press/dp/0262083078) by Karl Haglund.  I drove by the Charles so regularly when I lived in Newton.  Something about its history seems like a great opportunity.
* [_Karl Blossfeldt: Working Collages_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262025019/).  This one just caught my eye.  It seems to provide a peek into the way that an artist (sculptor) thinks about organizing his source images.
* [_The Science of Managing Our Digital Stuff_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262035170/).  I guess I could pretend that this relates to my research, but I got it more because I'm interested in  how best to deal with the massive amounts of things I accumulate in any world.  I also wonder about the gap between theory and (my) practice.
* [_Computer Games for Learning: An Evidence-Based Approach_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262027577/).  This one is more closely aligned with my research, even if I don't tend to use games.  I should probably share it with the StatsGames team.
* [_Makers of the Microchip: A Documentary History of Fairchild Semiconductor_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262027577/).  Noyce, Moore, and
  the rest of the traitorous eight.  Definitely worth reading.
* [_The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies_, 3rd edition](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262083647/).  I'm teaching our introductory Tech Studies course this spring [2].
* [_Sport 2.0: Transforming Sports for a Digital World_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262035472/).  I feel like I attended a symposium on related issues---or at least a talk on related issues--a year or two ago [6].
* [_Enfoldment and Infinity: An Islamic Genealogy of New Media Art_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262537362/).  I appreciate Islamic patterns and am interested to see how the author ties them to New Media.  I suppose that I could re-borrow the copy I'd borrowed from the library, but the last time I did so it got recalled.

I did manage to avoid purchasing books that, in days in which my
self control is less active, I might have added to the cart.  I
can't remember most of them, but let's see if I can identify a few.

* [_Forgetting the Art World_](https://www.amazon.com/Forgetting-Art-World-MIT-Press/dp/0262017733).  I like big art books.  But there are only so many you need.
* [_Foundations of 3D Computer Graphics_](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Computer-Graphics-MIT-Press/dp/0262017350).  I have too many 3D graphics books on my shelves.  I've already been weeding those out.
* [_Dolphin Communication and Cognition: Past, Present, and Future_](https://www.amazon.com/Dolphin-Communication-Cognition-Present-Future/dp/0262029677).  Sounds cool, doesn't it?  But I had to admit that I'd probably never end up reading it.
* [_Analytical Methods for Dynamic Modelers_](https://www.amazon.com/Analytical-Methods-Dynamic-Modelers-Press/dp/0262029499).  Seems like a useful text.  If I did a lot of modeling.  And understood math and statistics.  But those preconditions are not met.
* [_Rebel Genius: Warren S. McCulloch's Transdisciplinary Life in Science_](https://www.amazon.com/Rebel-Genius-McCullochs-Transdisciplinary-Science/dp/026203509X).  "Abraham uses McCulloch's life as a window on a past scientific age, showing the complex transformations that took place in American brain and mind science in the twentieth centuryâ€•particularly those surrounding the cybernetics movement."  Ties to CS and AI.  Sounds interesting.  And there are too many books on my shelf.

Now you know a bit more about my reading habits.  Or at least my planned
reading habits.  Or at least a subset of my planned reading habits; I've
left out fiction, teaching and learning, equity, higher ed, things like
that.  Oh well.

What about the books I did buy?  I'm calling all of them an early
birthday gift to myself.  Now I just have to gift myself time to
read.

**_Postscript_**: After the last MIT press sale, I spent a few hours
working on one of those rabbit-hole musings.  Then it fell to the side
before I finished it.  I wonder if I can find it again.

[1] Now available [free online](https://www.academia.edu/5203649/Visual_modeling_with_Logo_a_structured_approach_to_seeing?auto=download)!

[2] Well, I may be teaching that course this spring.  Plans are in a bit
of flux right now given the switch from fourteen-week semesters to
seven-week terms [3].

[3] Semesters also have a separate week for finals.  Terms have a pair
of days [4].

[4] Not a pair of dice.  Not paradise, either [5].

[5] That horrid joke is brought to you by the CSC 151 lab on random
number generation.

[6] KW probably remembers the exact date and speaker.

I love books.  I like reading them.  I like looking at the pictures.
I like the way that fiction takes me to new places and helps me
understand others.  I also like the way that nonfiction takes me
to other kinds of new places and helps me change how I think about
the world.  I particularly like scholarly books, or at least scholarly
books that relate to professional interests.  What kinds of professional
interests?  All sorts.  Computing.  Diversity in computing.  Teaching.
Functional programming.  Arts and computing.  Writing.  [Constructionist
thinking](constructionism-2020-06-03).  Stuff like that.

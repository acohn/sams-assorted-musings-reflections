Tornado weather
===============

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), Iowa, short*

Yesterday was an "interesting" day, or perhaps just a typical Iowa day.
I had planned to leave Iowa City at about 4:30 p.m. to return to Grinnell
by sixish.  But, well, Grinnell had a tornado warning [1] at about the
time I was planning to leave.  And, surprisingly, the sirens also started
going off in Iowa City.  I went downstairs to ask where they normally go
in the Obermann center.  It appears they were less worried than I was,
perhaps because the Iowa City sirens also go off for thunderstorms.
So we went outside to look at the sky.

Then I had a dilemma: What should I do about getting home?  If there
are tornado warnings in both the place I am and the place I plan to be,
is it really safe to drive for an hour between them?  There are certainly
options for staying in Iowa City: I have friends with spare bedrooms,
I have enough capital to rent a  hotel room, and, at worst, I keep
a blanket in my car and could probably sleep in the Obermann center.
I'd have to wear the same clothes the next day [2] and I'd have to do
without my CPAP [3], but it's a possibility.

But I like being home with my family.  Youngest also needed me to edit an
essay.  I needed to check our own basement, as well as the basement at
1211 Main Street.  And I sleep much better in my own bed.  Plus, I'm an
idiot.

So I checked the weather radar.  It looked like there was a gap between
5:00 p.m. and 6:15 p.m. when I-80 would be relatively calm.  So I decided
to brave the trip.  It seems to have been the right decision.  The roadway
was dry.  Winds were reasonable [4].  And it was good to be home.

You know what?  I'm sick of the weather this fall.  There's too much rain.
There are too many tornado-like situations.  And I have it relatively easy.
While the 1211 basement does flood [4], I don't have to worry about crops to
bring in, travel I *must* do, or ....

Pithy final statement.

---

[1] If I understand the terminology correctly, "watch" means that the
conditions are right for a weather event to happen and "warning" means
that the 

[2] or go clothes shopping

[3] not a very good option

[4] Our basement gets water, too, just not as much and not as often.

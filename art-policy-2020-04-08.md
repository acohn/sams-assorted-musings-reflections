Yesterday, Grinnell released a new set of policies governing the
use of software on campus.  I understand the reasons for these
policies: the College needs to protect itself; we are concerned
about student and faculty privacy; in a time in which not all
students have reliable or high-bandwidth access to the Internet,
we'd like to keep things managable; and we are concerned about the
burden that learning multiple software packages might put on students.

But expecting faculty to immediately discontinue software central
to a course, or to change the software to something supposedly
similar, but that requires retraining, or to put their current use
on hold until they receive permission from ITS [1,2], puts a huge
burden on faculty.  And the lack of clarity on what software is
permissible increases that burden.  I do not, for example, see LaTeX
or the MathLAN web server on those lists.  I think it is safe to
assume that both are permissible, but how can I be sure?

But my goal in this piece is not to provide an endless list of my
concerns about the new policy nor my prior experiences having to
shift software use nor discovering that supposedly "equivalent"
software lacks most of the features I rely on nor the new software
that regularly gets imposed on faculty [3,5].  Rather, I thought it
would be fun to rephrase the policy and the associated experiences
in terms of another domain.

*Note: Portions of this piece could be read as critical of ITS staff,
particularly the front-line ITS staff who have to deal with people like
me.  My experience over the past few years has been that the staff are
cooperative and do seriously want to make a positive difference, but are
burdened by a too-high workload, the vageries of technolgy, and the need
to support decisions that they had no influence over.  I hope that my
colleagues in ITS understand that I am not trying to critique them and
that I appreciate their hard work.*

> "For the protection and safety of our students we want to ensure that anything they view is not too challenging.  Hence, we have decided to limit what artworks may be used in classes."

"What artists can I use?"

> "The college has a very large portfolio of approved artists and artwork.  Current events have meant that our work on a catalog has been paused.  Our catalog of general-use artists includes Thomas Kinkade, painter of light."

"I've been using Bruegel's 'Tower of Babel' in my classes and research for the pat five years.  Can I keep using it.  Since students are already famliar with it, I spent the past two weeks restructuring the last six weeks of my course around that work."

> "It is not on our list of approved artwork.  Discontinue its use
immediately and fill out the form.  Please fill out a form.  As we
have said, you are not permitted to use any other work until your
selection has been approved.  Doing so puts the College at risk for
a copyright infringement suit or for repetitional damages associated
with the content of the work."

"I've filled out the form.  When can I expect a response?"

> [Silence]

> [More silence]

> "Thomas Kinkade has works entitled 'Chicago, Winter at the Water Tower' and 'Tower Bridge, London'.  We expect that they will serve your needs for a tower."

"Those pieces lack the depth, symbolic meaning, or religious context of 'Tower of Babel'.  I'd really like to use 'Tower of Babel'."

> [Silence]

> [More silence]

> "We have determined that Thomas Kinkade has also released a work entitled 'Tower of David'.  That provides appropriate religious imagery."

"That piece, while including a tower and referencing religion, is different.  I am having trouble figuring out how I could use it in place of 'Tower of Babel'."

> "Please note that resources (whether financial, support time, or otherwise) are not infinite.  If possible, consult with your ASAs or look for resources online."

"I have looked at Kinkade's 'Tower of David' and read the online analyses.  It does not provide the metaphorical imagery to ground the discussions."

> "Are you sure that students are able to process metaphoric imagery at this time?  Please bear in mind that artistic and conceptual simplicity are key tenets to keep in mind in this unprecedented time: the fewer artworks and artists that students need to learn and manage concurrently, the better."

"Yes, I am sure."

> "Please explain what steps you have made to ensure that the artwork is accessible to those with physical or cognitive differences."

"I already consider that issue for all of my classes.  It is, after all, the right thing to do.  Here's the statement from my syllabus."

> "Please provide the licensing terms for the artwork you intend to use, an address for the artist, an anticipated cost of using the artwork, a contact person at the artist's studio, the artist's FERPA policy, and operating system or systems on which one can view the artwork.  Please indicate whether the artwork will be used for legal compliance; a mandatory function other than legal compliance; business processes, information flows, reporting, or data analytics; cross-organizational unit functionality.  Will the artwork be available to all students and used by a majority of students?  Must we seek licensing permissions for all faculty and all staff?"

"Really?  Okay.  Done."

> "Please note that resources (whether financial, support time, or otherwise) are not infinite."

"Neither are mine."

[1] I know that ITS is severely overworked and overwhelmed.  I worry
what that means about how timely their responses will be.  I recall
hearing from colleagues that they waited multiple weeks when they
requested permission at the start of the planning for the switch
to online learning.

[2] The form for requesting software is fascinatingly long and detailed.
Perhaps I will share those details someday.  For now, note that I have

[3] *Cough* *Cough* *Sedona* *Cough* *Cough* [4].

[4] Come to think of it, I wonder if Sedona is FERPA-compliant.  I
don't see anything about FERPA in [their privacy
policy](https://sedonaweb.com/i/privacy.cfm).  I assume it's implicit.
Or maybe they are an officer of the College.

[5] Why did it seem like I had to agree to Microspam [6] in order to
approve declarations of majors?

[6] In particular, in order to use the service, it seemed like I
had to agree to the statement "Microsoft will send you promotions
and offers. You can unsubscribe at any time."  I've heard that
people who agreed have had difficulty unsubscribing.

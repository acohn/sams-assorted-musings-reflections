Gratitude
=========

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), belated*

On the day some folks call "Gratitude day" and others call "Turkey
day" [1], I like to step back and reflect on the many things I'm
grateful for.  I hope that everyone has something for which they
are grateful, but I also realize that I am particularly fortunate
in the way my life has turned out.

I am most grateful for my family.  I have three spectacular sons
of whom I am quite proud and a wonderful wife who is generous to
those around her and who puts up with me.  This year, I am particularly
grateful that my children were all able to make it home for the
holiday.  While I enjoy each of them individually, I also love
seeing how they interact and collaborate, whether in a game or in
a project [3].  Michelle's brother and sister-in-law braved the
wintry weather to join us; it's always great to have them around.
I will admit that I'm sad about the family members who are no longer
with us; it's hard to believe that we've been without any parents
for almost a decade.

I am also grateful that we have the resources to bring others into
our house for the shared meal.  Middle son invited a variety of
friends and teammates, including at least two students who often
feel like family.  While I also enjoy sharing the meal at our
friends' houses, it feels particularly nice to be able to bring
people here.  It also reminds both Michelle and me of our times
growing up, times when our parents were always happy to have others
join us for the meal.

I am grateful for a job, an institution, and a town that fit me well.
As I say frequently, I'm very lucky to have a job where I can make
a positive difference to amazing young adults and enjoy myself while
doing so.  I also have a lot of freedom, work with insightful and
intelligent people, and get compensated well for the work I do.
Although I do complain [4] regularly about Grinnell, it is a wonderful
institution at which to work.  Not only do we have the resources
to try curricular innovation and to support students who could
otherwise not afford a top-tier liberal arts education, but we also
have an engaged faculty and staff and a student-centered curriculum.
As I said, I'm fortunate to work with a wide variety of excellent
colleagues.  Whenever I visit another institution and ask myself
whether I'd be happier there, the answer is always "I'm happier at
Grinnell."  This year, I'm particularly grateful for our new Dean,
who, in my experiences so far, seems to be amazing.  I'm also
grateful that we have permission to hire for a new tenure-line
position.  As far as I can tell, that will put us at the number
necessary to support demand in CS.

I said "a job, an institution, and a *town*", didn't I?  Grinnell
(the town) was a wonderful place to raise my children; I'm thrilled
that they did not have to track themselves into only one characteristic,
and that each was able to be a strong scholar, an active athlete
(each in three sports), a mature musician, and a talented theatre
tech, among other things.  I like that I know a lot of people around
me and that it's easy to walk everywhere, including to work.  I do
wish that we had more restaurants and that we had more of the New
England terrain that makes me feel at home, but it's worth it for
the other benefits.  I know that others feel otherwise, that they
want more big-city resources, more anonymity, and more distance
from their work.   But I'm happy to be here.

I'm grateful that I have the skills to do the things that I do, whether
it's teaching, musing, or helping my children fix doors.  I'm also grateful
that I have readers for my musings and rants, many of whom respond
in thoughtful [5] ways.

Could things be better?  Certainly.  Could things be worse?  Definitely.
In any case, they are pretty wonderful.  I feel fortunate to be where
I am in life.

[1] There's another T-word for that day, but I understand the objections
some of my friends have to the historical implications of that name [2].

[2] Yes, I realize that other friends will likely consider this word choice
taking "political correctness" too far.

[4] Or rant.

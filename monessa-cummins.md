Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Monessa Cummins
=============================================================

*Forthcoming.*

---

Notes:

I'm not saying anything that anyone doesn't know when I say that MC
is one of the best teachers at Grinnell.

Monessa was here when I arrived.

Early memories: Panel on religion (with Katya).  What she did for Tony
Stubblebine.  Some long discussion on writing in which she talked about
her then practice (two spaces after periods, etc.).

The college took advantage of her.

At some point we became friends, or at least friendly.

Generous towards CS students.

Joy in sitting on Wilson with her.  Fun to pick apart sentence structure
and style.

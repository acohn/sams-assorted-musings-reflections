Today I was on Facebook and a message popped up.  It said something
like "[Jon Richardson](https://www.facebook.com/jonrichardsonmusic/)
is now performing live".  Jon's a former student [1] who did lots
of fantastic things at Grinnell, including helping with some major
searches.  If I recall correctly, Jon went on to work for a search
firm before deciding that his heart was really in music.  He's been
performing ever since.

In any case, I stopped whatever I was doing and started watching.
I've not had the chance to see Jon perform live before and it was
great to be able to see and hear him.  He was also clearly watching
the messages on the chat.  It was nice to get a personal shout out
and to hear others get shout outs.

I don't do much on Facebook, so I hadn't realized that Facebook
notifies you when a friend joins a live video.  I got a chance to
reconnect with one of my mother's good friends.  I got to connect
with a former Grinnell colleague.  I got to spend some time chatting
with a colleague I haven't seen in a while.  And I got to see a bunch
of comments from Trustees I know and respect [2].

I also enjoyed seeing the community that developed in the chat.
Different groups of people in the chat clearly know each other, but
cross-person chat developed, about song requests, singing along,
or how to leave a tip.  There was also some conversation about the
songs he sang.  (I got to ask who people associate with "Delta
Dawn".  Is it Tanya Tucker or Helen Reddy [3]?)

Michelle and I had a great time listening along.  In addition to the
googly-eyed performance of "Delta Dawn", I particularly enjoyed the
version of "Suddenly Seymour" [4].  And I loved the range of music.

I see from [Jon's professional Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/jonrichardsonmusic/) that he'll be
performing each day this week at 5 p.m. EDT. Today's performance was
on [Jon's personal page](https://www.facebook.com/jonjrichardson23).
I encourage you to visit some of his future concerts.  (And, if you
live in the Northeast, please visit his concerts in person once they
resume.)

**Thank you, Jon**, for building community, for your wonderful
performance, and for being you.  I hope I can keep tuning in for
the rest of this virtual residency [5].  And I hope to see many more
of my friends there.

[1] Or maybe just a former committee colleague.

[2] Yes, there are Trustees I know and respect.

[3] I realize that I've asked the question before.

[4] I loved the start; I'll admit that I could have done without
the alternative voices through the middle.

[5] Is that the right term?

Our better Grinnellian story
============================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), marketing, language*

Last week, I wrote about [my frustration with our new
marketing campaign](our-grinnellian-story-2018-05-10),
particularly _Our Grinnellian Story_, the internal guide
to our new marketing campaign, and our new [the marketing
page](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/communications/brand/promise).
I'm particularly frustrated to hear a rumor that we are using the
non-grammatical noun phrase on posters at the Des Moines airport.

As I've continued to explore our marketing, I've noted other things
that concerned me.  I may report on those in the future.  However, 
it's not all bad.  I have found something that gives
me hope that the underlying concept can be applied well
in practice.  What is that something?  [Our new Admissions
site](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission), particularly the [Why
Grinnell](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell) portion.
There, we see the concepts that were so poorly expressed in _Our
Grinnellian Story_ expanded upon and described with much more sensible
writing.  

Let's look at one example.  You may recall that _Our Grinnellian Story_
had the following piece of awkwardly written [1] text.

> **Academics**. Through our academics we support individually advised
learning for the intellectually engaged so they can navigate the world's
complexities and contribute with great responsibility. We do this by
offering: Liberal arts and mentored research that equips Grinnellians
to pursue ideas and knowledge with confidence.

In contrast, this is what we see at "Why Grinnell".

> **Academics**.  As Grinnellians, we believe in free inquiry and the
open exchange of ideas. So here, you'll think creatively and critically
about the world around you. You'll dive deep into theoretical and
scientific research. You'll work alongside world-class experts,
advisers, and mentors who are dedicated to your success.

That's a statement, I can more readily accept.

More broadly, I'm comfortable with the way they've added details to
the three facets that they've assigned to a Grinnell education.
The [Academics](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/academics)
section has pages for the [individually advised
curriculum](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/academics/individually-advised)
[2], the [first-year
tutorial](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/academics/tutorial),
and [mentored
research](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/academics/research).
[Commitment](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/commitment)
includes social [responsibility and
service](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/commitment/social-responsibility)
and [career
forward](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/commitment/career-forward)
[5].  Finally,
[Community](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/community)
includes [advisers at
Grinnell](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/community/advisers)
[6], [global understanding &
diversity](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/community/global-understanding),
and [campus
culture](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/community/campus-culture).
I might make slight changes, but that's a good approach.

Let's turn to the headings in the
[Academics](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/academics)
section.

* _Grinnellians map their own academic journeys._  Yup, that's a great
  way to summarize the individually advised curriculum.  The
  accompanying paragraph is good, too, particularly in how it speaks
  to the others who help them map those journeys.
* _Liberal arts foundation: An education that reflects on its own process._
  I don't recall where else we use "reflects on its own process", but it's
  a phrase I appreciate.
* _Off-campus study: Let your learning take you further._  We do have
  OCS implicitly under "global understanding", but I'm okay to see it 
  here, too [7].
* _World-class faculty: They purposefully choose Grinnell, just like you._
  The accompanying text doesn't really explain *why* we choose Grinnell.
  And not all of us had options.  But I do think it's a reasonable and
  attractive way to describe the College.
* _An evolving, engaging, empowering education._  Ooh!  Alliteration.
  I'm a sucker for alliteration.

However, I wouldn't be me if I didn't find something to complain about
[8,9].  So I'm not sure why the "off-campus study" section is immediately
under a picture of the Spencer Grill, taken through two out-of-focus
flags from other countries nor why the "world-class faculty" section is
immediately below a picture of someone other than a faculty member, or
why the "e-cubed education" is immediately under a picture of students
working in half-hexagon cubicles.  I'd also like to see better alt text
on these images [10].

Switching back to a more positive side, we turn to the [Mentored
research](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/academics/research)
page.  The most obvious thing I take from the page is that faculty
love mentoring research.  We have a grinning Paul Hutchison at the
top of the page and an incredibly happy and enthusiastic Gemma Sala at
the bottom.  Importantly, the page notes that "about 50% of Grinnell
students complete at least one MAP before graduating", which correctly
informs prospective students that not every student should expect a MAP. 
Perhaps most importantly, they list the topics of some individual MAPs,
which meets my goal of having examples for our stories.

There are, of course, some misstatements.  It wouldn't be marketing if
there weren't.  For example, "At the end of the MAP research opportunity,
all students present their results through a formal means".  While our
goal is that all students develop work that is appropriate for external
presentation, not all MAP projects end with such work.  It's research.
Sometimes projects don't turn out as planned.  Sometimes they go in
different directions than is expected.  Sometimes their primary success
is in setting the stage for the next project.  That's fine, and that's
been an expectation of the MAP process since day one.  I'd also like
to see them mention an equally important issue: When students do get a
chance to present their work "regionally, nationally, or internationally",
the College pays the cost of attending.

What to explore next?  Can I be uniformly positive about some portion of
this site?  Probably not.  It's not within my personality.  So I'll just
say that I'm unhappy with the return to the "drawers" of information
that used to be a problematic hallmark of the Grinnell site [11].
I'll note that I'm unhappy that they use the term "tutorial" for the
[global-learning program](https://www.grinnell.edu/global/institute/glp)
courses [15], but that's not the fault of admissions.  I'm not sure
why the menus use a font that is not any of the four basic ones that
Communications tells us we must use.  I'm not sure what to make of [a
quotation that begins with an ellipsis and that ends after the speaker's
name](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/community/global-understanding).
And I really don't understand why [information for the campus on our pay
categories](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/financial-aid/affording-grinnell/student-employment)
belongs on the admissions site, hidden away in a drawer [16].

Did I get the curmudgeon out of my system?  I hope so.

In the end, the new admissions site is a thoughtful piece of work that
represents Grinnell well.  And I really do mean that.  There are flaws,
but they are comparatively minor.    And the whole "affording Grinnell"
part does a reasonably nice job of making attending Grinnell seem possible.

So, *thank you* to those who worked on this aspect of the new campaign.
Let's hope that the rest of the campaign eventually achieves this quality.

Postscript: You know what's sad?  I started this musing intending it to
be exclusively positive.  And the site is nice.  But I couldn't just
be positive.  What's that they say?  "You can take the curmudgeon off
of the name tag, but ...."  No, that's not it.  "You can dress up a
curmudgeon but it's still a curmudgeon."  No, that's not it either.
"Sam, chill."  Yeah, that's probably it.

[1] Or, as one reader suggests, computer generated.

[2] Note: That's individually advised *curriculum*, not this individually
advised *learning* bullstuff [3].

[3] I'm still waiting for an explanation from Communications on what that
they mean by "individually advised learning".  But I'm also waiting for
a variety of responses from Communications [4].

[4] There's probably a joke in there about how Communications communicates.
I'll let you make it.

[5] I'll admit that I find "Career Forward" awkward.  I'd much prefer
something like "Careers, Life, and Service" or something else that emphasizes
our more holistic view of post-Grinnell life.

[6] As I hinted at [recently](changing-grinnell-01), they are highlighting
the three different advisers each student has.  There was a point in my
career in which I would have ranted a lot about this decision.  These
days, I accept that it's a good idea.

[7] Global engagement of some sort also appears under [campus
culture](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/community/campus-culture).
We are clearly pushing the concept of Global Grinnell.

[8] Or should that be "about which to complain"?

[9] The comment on alliteration was *not* a complaint.  I really do like
alliteration.

[10] Image 1: Two students working together on what looks like a wood
shop project.  The alt text?  "Liberal Arts".  I don't get it.  Image 2: A
student studying in the Spencer Grill, as seen through out-of-focus flags.
The alt text?  "Campus Study".  I guess that one isn't so bad.  Image 3:
A student working with a staff member on what seems to be a cool vacuum
chamber experiment.  The alt text?  "Faculty".  That one is fascinating,
since it doesn't show any faculty members.  (That's not to say that the
staff member isn't awesome; in fact, they are someone I respect highly
and who I know to play important roles in their department.)  Image 4:
Students working in computer cubicles.  The alt text?  "text".  Yeah,
that one's the worst of the four.

[11] What's a "drawer"?  It's a collapsible section of text on a page
that usually starts out in collapsed form.  See, for example,
[our page on diversity and global understanding](https://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/community/global-understanding) [12].  Why don't I
like drawers?  Because it makes it hard to find particular pieces of
text.  Suppose, for example, that I knew that "language immersion"
appeared somewhere on the page.  On a traditional Web page, I can just
use the browser's "Find".  One one of these pages, the normal behavior
of "Find" is to report that it can't be found.  So I have to manually
open each of the drawers and look inside [14].  That's not a convenient user
experience.  Worse, I might treat the inability to find a phrase as a
sign that the text isn't even there.

[12] Since *inclusion* is one of our key goals, shouldn't that also go
somewhere in our materials?

[14] Would you look for "language immersion" under "Diversity", "Off-Campus
Study", "Global Learning Program", or "Language Learning Center"?

[15] "Tutorial" has a specific meaning at Grinnell and we should not
undermine that meaning.  The use in multiple contexts might confuse
prospective students.  Why can't they just call it a course?

[16] I get that it's useful information for prospective students.
But it's not just a financial aid issue; putting it there seems strange.
Isn't pay an HR issue?

A speech to graduating CS majors in the class of 2018
=====================================================

*Topics/tags: [Speeches](index-talks-speeches), Grinnell, Grinnell CS*

*On Monday, 15 May 2018, we had our annual "Celebration of CS Seniors"
in Relish.  A few years ago, I realized after ad-libbing a speech that
it might be good to (a) [record what I had written](cs-seniors-2016)
and perhaps (b) try writing the future ones in advance.  I have no
memory of what I did last year.  But this year, I'm trying to write
things out.  It's unlikely that I'll read it exactly.*

Good afternoon.  Thank you so much for coming to this celebration and
for the four years you have shared with us (or the three years you've
shared with us, in some cases).  It is hard to see this group of CS 
majors graduate.  You are the last group of majors to have entered
Grinnell when we were a comparatively small major (we had twelve or
thirteen graduates in the class of 2015) and you are the largest group
of majors so far (37 in the class of 2016, 38 in the class of 2017,
42 in your class plus 5 mid-year graduates).  But don't worry; next
year's class will easily surpass yours.  They were at 58 when last
I checked (or 59, if you count the two entries for the SGA President
Elect in the campus directory).

You've also watched other parts of the department grow.  Both Charlie
and PM started while you were here.  You've had Titus for the two years
he was here and may have even participated in his search.  Many of you
contributed to the expansion search that brought us Anya.  That reminds
me: It's stupid survey time.  How many of you have taken a class from
all of the eight current CS faculty?  (That's Weinman, Walker, Vostinar,
Stone, Rebelsky, Osera, Klinge, Curtsinger.)  How many took a class from
at least six faculty, if we throw Janet into the mix?  

Speaking of faculty lines, I have something happy to tell you.  If you
haven't heard already, you'll be pleased to hear that we have been
approved to do another tenure-track search next year.

There's also one important non-faculty addition to the department.
You've seen us add an awesome peer education coordinator in Sarah.

You have contributed to this department in so many ways.  Many of you
have served as peer educators, helping your fellow students learn through
your work as mentors, evening tutors, individual tutors, and graders.
Some of you have served on the SEPC, building the social life of the
department and providing representation for student voices in various
departmental decisions.  Some of you started or built organizations, such
as AppDev and WGMC.  And all of you have contributed by your presence
and (often) your enthusiasm for the material.  I feel lucky to have such
excellent students in our department.  I know that my colleagues do, too.

I appreciate that so many of you are double majors and that you have
brought concepts from those other majors to our department.  Let's see
.... Your class includes double majors with Biological Chemistry, Classics,
Economics, GWSS, Mathematics, Music, Philosophy, Political Science,
Physics, Psychology, Studio Art, and Theatre and Dance.  I hope that most
of you have not made the same decision as Kumail Nanjiani '01, who said
"I majored in CS for my parents.  I majored in Philosophy for myself."
We also have a few folks here who are not quite CS majors.  I'm not sure
what to make of the fact that in at least two of the cases, the one class
they are missing is mine.

I used to give every student a "humorous" award.  (E.g., we had one
student get an Alan Funt award for always making me feel like I was on
candid camera; another got the "feather pillow" award for an apparent
ability to sleep anywhere and everywhere in the department.)  However,
I wasn't sure that I'd be able to come up with one for each of you; it's
much easier to do a dozen than three dozen.  My colleagues have suggested
that we would be better off without them.  (You know my sense of humor,
so you also know that they are probably right.)  I don't think I should
call you out individually, so I'll just say once again that each of you
has contributed to the department in your own special way and that
we very much appreciate those contributions.

But you don't have to walk away with nothing.  I do have a present
for you.  When I graduated college (more accurately, *The* College
at *The* University of Chicago), my favorite gift was a cookbook.
One of my mother's students gave me _The Enchanted Broccoli Forest_,
a vegetarian cookbook by Molly Katzen.  You are all special to me,
so I would like to give you a similar gift.  You can stop by my office
in the next few days to get a vegetarian cookbook from me.  I'll even
inscribe it if you'd like.  Why a vegetarian cookbook?  Two reasons:
Because that's what I got and because the odds are good that you are
either vegetarian or close friends with a vegetarian.

We wish you the best in the many careers you choose.  I'll remind you
that there are many things you can do with a CS degree.  While we have
many graduates in the computing industry, we also have graduates who are
helicopter pilots, physicians, fund raisers, and professional comedians.
Please do not feel constrained by your major.

Our office of Development and Alumni Relations, ("DAR" in Grinnell-speak,
even though "DAR" might also stand for "Daughters of the American
Revolution" or my third son), as well as [name elided], who serves would
consider me remiss if I did not talk to you about the ways in which you
can support the College and the department.  We are able to celebrate you
at this lunch because alums and faculty have donated to the department's
restricted fund.  We hope that as you go off to your awesome careers,
you will consider giving to the department, to the College, or to other
entities at the College that have special meaning to you.  You can also
give of your time.  The CLS externship program can always use more hosts.
And, at some point, we'll find a way for alums to help current students
with technical interviews.

As a special added bonus, if you donate to the department there is
a reasonably good chance that you will get a [signed thank you
letter](donor-thank-you.html) from Jerod if you donate to the department.
That's much better than the chance you had when I was chair.  As Rachel
will attest, I had lots of not-yet-signed letters get lost in my office.

I will also say once more that computing technology has great power,
power to change the world.  As technologists, you have responsibility
to think about the software you build or contribute to.  I hope that our
conversations at CS table, in our classes, and in the hallway have gotten
you to think more about the risks of computing and your own relationship
to those risks.

On that note, I will remind you that the department is hosting a [Pledge
of the Computing Professional[(http://www.computing-professional.org/)
ceremony on Sunday, after baccalaureate.  (The nice thing about speeches
is that I don't have to worry about spelling that word.)  I hope that
many of you will take that pledge, which I think reflects the Grinnell
CS department's perspective.  Your parents may certainly attend, too.
Everyone who takes the pledge gets a pin, a certificate, and a stole
to wear at graduation.  (The stoles were expensive, and our budget is
limited, so we'll need them back afterwards.  If, for some strange reason,
you really want one, talk to me and we can probably let you purchase one.)
I appreciate that Charlie reminded me that I should have brought one.
You can see one in my office or at the ceremony.

We also have a breakfast on Monday morning in JRC 101.  We had hoped to
have it on Noyce 3rd but, well, there are just too many of you.  At about
9am, we will take a group photo.

I've been rambling enough.  I'll let you get back to your conversations.
Know that we are proud of you, that we will enjoy seeing you march 
across the stage on Monday, and that we will miss you.

Postscript: I thought about working something in about the new
marketing campaign.  Then I decided it wasn't worth it.  Maybe next
year.  Maybe five years from now: "You are the first class that came
under the new 'noun phrase' campaign.  I'm glad to see it was a
success."

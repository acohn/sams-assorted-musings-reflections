In [a recent musing](annoying-link-requests-2020-01-02), I noted that I
have long-term plans to add links to the College's statements about
Web accessibility.  As long as I was mentioning those plans, I thought I'd
go looking for the current statement.

Before going on with my adventures related to that statement, I
should probably give you a bit of context.  A few years ago, I was
invited to serve on the College's sub-task-force on digital
accessibility.  That may be because I value accessibility in general
and do my best to carry that value into my work, particularly my
Web work.  For example, I generally make the effort to ensure that
my pages are accessible, whether that means including appropriate
markup, adding alt tags to text, or whatever.  I may also have been
invited because I'm a curmudgeon about such things, because I'm
technologically literate, or because Rachel Schnepper was on the team
and wanted me on board [1].  The team was successful at putting together
a set of recommendations; I see that most of them have been incorporated
into our official [digital accessibility policy](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2018-09/Digital%20Accessibility%20Policy%208-1-2018.pdf) [2].

Given my experience on that task force, I expected to see some text about
accessibility on each College page, along with links to further information
and to a contact person who could help.  Something along the lines of,

> Grinnell is committed to accessibility and do our best to make our
pages accessible.  If you have difficulty accessing the information on
this page, please contact <insertNameHere@grinnell.edu>.  Further details
are available in ours tatement on accessibility.

Upon reaching the [College's home page](https://www.grinnell.edu/), I
was surprised to see that no such text exists on the page.  In fact,
neither "accessibility" nor "disability" seems to appear anywhere on
the home page.  I was able to follow [the Policies link](https://www.grinnell.edu/policies) to find the broader policy on digital acessibility.  But
I could not find a way to get the kind of statement I expected by clicking
links.

With some searching, I was able to find our [Web accessibility stateemnt](https://www.grinnell.edu/web-accessibility).  It starts well.

> Grinnell College is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability.

> This website endeavors to comply with best practices and standards as defined by Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act and level AA of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities. Conformance with these guidelines will help make the web more user-friendly for all people.

[1] Or perhaps the other members of the board wanted someone to counter
Rachel.  WHo knows.

[2] Have I mentioned how much I hate file names that include the date
in MM-D-YY format?  I appreciate the inclusion of the date for clarity,
but YYYY-MM-DD is much better because (a) it's unambiguous and (b) it
ensures that a list of files appears in the right order.

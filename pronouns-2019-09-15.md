Pronouns
========

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), autobiographical, academia*

Over the past decade or so in academia, it's become common practice
to announce your pronouns when you meet a group for the first time.
The practice is designed, in part, to make it more comfortable for
those whose pronouns don't necessarily match their appearance to
explain how to address them appropriately.  And, as we all know,
addressing people appropriately shows respect [1].  For folks like
myself who present as the same gender as they identify, announcing
your gender pronouns can make it easier for others to announce their
pronouns.

My own practice with asking students to announce pronouns has evolved
over the years.  Like many, I used to require it.  But then I learned
that forcing people to announce their pronouns can make life difficult
for some people, such as those who may not want to "out" themselves in
classroom situations.  These days, I make it optional.

One complicating factor, at least from my perspective, is what to
do when you choose to address people by last name.  There are times
that I consider it more appropriate to use last names in class.  I
sometimes do it out of habit; when I came to Grinnell, last names
were *de rigueur* in some classes.  But I also like to subvert
notions of authority; if I have students call me by first name and
address them by last name, it helps identify them as authorities
[2,3].

Over the past few years, I've been surprised to discover that many
students are uncomfortable giving themselves a title, even though
I offer options with a menu like "Ms. Smith, Mr. Smith, Mx. Smith,
or whatever you consider appropriate."  Most frequently, students
say, "If you must address me by last name [4], please address me as
'Smith', with no title."

I self-identify as a culturally Jewish, cisgender, heterosexual,
overweight male.  At least three of those aspects give me cultural
capital.  So I generally say something like,

> I use he/him/his pronouns.  If you must address me by last name,
please call me "Mr. Rebelsky", "Professor Rebelsky", or "Dr.
Rebelsky" [5].  If you choose to address me in the generic, I am
likely to do the same in response.  That is, if you just call me
"Professor", I will just call you "Student".

I've been starting to rethink that statement, as well as my practices.
In particular, I've begun to wonder whether I should just switch
to a gender-neutral pronoun for everyone I discuss, or perhaps do
without pronouns altogether.  Would that make my classroom more
inclusive?  I'm not sure.  I must also admit that I consider it a
bit disingenuous to apply "they/them/theirs" to myself because those
pronouns are typically reserved for those who do not identify on
the gender binary, and, as I said, I identify as male.  Let's see,
what would my statement look like if I tried to incorporate these
ideas?

> I discourage the use of pronouns, particularly gendered pronouns.
If you use pronouns for me, I prefer that you use they/them/theirs,
even though I identify as male, because I consider those pronouns
more inclusive.  Nonetheless, "Sam/Sam/Sam's" is better.  If you
are worried that "they/them/theirs" are plural, one can find evidence
throughout the past few centuries of those pronouns as singular
gender-neutral forms [6].

I recall discussing this idea with one of my children and having that
child note something like, "That approach does not address the issue of 
students being misgendered by other members of the class."  They may
be right.

What to do?  What to do?  I had hoped [7] that musing about the issue
would help me reach a conclusion.  It hasn't.  Perhaps my musings will
influence others wiser than I to issue guidance to me and to others.
We shall see.

Postscript: As my students know, I don't always do a good job of getting
pronouns right.  Please know that I'm trying my best!

Postscript: I suppose if I were a more responsible person, I'd start
looking for the most recent scholarship on inclusion and pronoun use.
However, I'm not teaching this year, so I think I'll leave that deeper
exploration until closer to the time I next teach.

[1] How should I take it that I keep appearing in print as "Sam Rebelsky"
even though I regularly tell people that I prefer "Samuel A. Rebelsky".

[2] At least that's what I'd like to think.

[3] It also confuses them, which is likely one of my other goals.

[4] The "If you must address me by last name" is part of my standard
script for introducing yourself to the class.  I include it not only
because I want to address students by last name, but also because it
gets them to pronounce their last names for me.

[5] Yes, I realize that "Dr. Rebelsky" is how most people refer to
Michelle.  I have also earned the title.

[7] Or perhaps my muse had hoped.

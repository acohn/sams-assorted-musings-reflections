For some reason I don't quite understand, every month or two I get
a request to add a link to one of the pages I manage.  Here's a sample.

I got a followup message a few days later.

This pair of messages is better than most since it references a
page I've updated within the past year.  Often, the requests are
for ancient course pages from a decade or more ago.

I assume that messages like this must be automated.  It's not hard
to scrape my email address off of a page [1] and it's only slightly
harder to figure out my name.  Still, I am interested in the algorithm
they use to do the latter.  How do they pick the page?  I assume
they look for pages that have comparatively high page ranks.  But
I wouldn't expect mine to have a high rank for "federated learning",
whatever that is [2].

These kinds of messages seem to play on our sense of politeness;
it's only reasonable to write back and say "I'm sorry, but I'm not
interested in linking" or even to add the link to the page.  But
these requests are generally spam, so I treat these messages much
like I treat spam phone calls; I discard them as soon as I realize
that they are spam [3].

You know what?  It may be time to set up an official policy about
link requests.  Let's see ...

> **On link requests**

> I regularly receive requests to add links to my pages.  I charge
  a fee of $100 to consider such requests.  If I consider the link
  appropriate, I will be happy to negotiate a fee for adding the
  page.  Most fees are a minimum of $100, which represents my effort
  at adding the link.

> I may waive both fees for people in academia and those at select 
  nonprofits, such as EFF or Creative Commons.

Yeah, that seems reasonable.  I'm going to add that to my home page.
Next, I need to figure out how to add a link to that to all of my
pages [4].

Do other folks get these kinds of requests and, if so, what do you do
in response?  Are you interested in partnering in an LLC to regularize
the charge?

[1] Or, I suppose, to figure out my email address from the URL.

[2] Nope, I'm not going to bother to look it up on the Interweb.
Nor am I going to follow the link they sent me, since that may tell
them that I read their email.

[3] I recall an interview with a telemarketer on NPR a decade or
more ago, which went something like this: "We rely on people being
polite.  Until you hang up on me, I'm going to keep trying to
convince you to buy our product".  Since hearing that, I'm perfectly
comfortable hanging up on telemarketers; it's better for them.  If
I were a less nice person, I'd set up an AI voice response system.

[4] That's a useful exercise because I should be updating all of
my pages in multiple ways, particularly when I am forced onto a new
server.  Among other things, I should add links to the College's
accessibility statement for Web pages [5], our [DMCA
contact](https://www.grinnell.edu/digital-millennium-copyright-act-1998),
and other similar things.  I might also update my CC licenses to
the latest versions.

[5] I had a bit of difficulty finding that, but it's now linked from
our primary site.  It's at <https://www.grinnell.edu/web-accessibility>.
Unfortunately, much of the content deals with our primary site, making
it inapplicable to my site.

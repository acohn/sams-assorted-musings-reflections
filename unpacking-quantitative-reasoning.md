Unpacking "quantitative reasoning"
==================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), liberal arts, computational thinking*

A group on campus has recently been unpacking [1] one of Grinnell's six
elements of the liberal arts [2] or perhaps an element of a strong
education that is closely related to those six elements.  They did
a nice job and the faculty recently approved their proposal to formalize
the list.

I've been thinking a bit more about another one of those elements,
that of "quantitative reasoning".  Here's what we say about that topic.

> 4\. Quantitative reasoning, with emphasis on mathematical models and methods
above the secondary-school level, aids in the expression of hypotheses,
processes, and theoretical relations. A course in statistics can be
helpful for all students, and particularly for those who might work in
the social and behavioral sciences. Studies in computer science offer
valuable exposure to principles of logic and problem-solving paradigms. [4]

I've never liked that paragraph.  As far as I can tell, there's no real
connection between the three sentences, other than the tendency of people
outside of our departments to link CS, Statistics, and Computer Science.
I'm also not sure that mathematical models, hypotheses, and theoretical
relations have much to do with the study of quantities.  They can,
but they need not.

I've come to the conclusion that we really need to spend some time
unpacking what we expect when we say that students have mastered, or
at least encountered, the kinds of skills and concepts intended for
this element.  In the ideal world, we'd convene a group to study the
issue and come up with a clear, well-thought-out, description of the
issues [5].  I don't know when or if such a group will be formed.  For
the time being, I'll provide my own perspective [6].

When I hear the term "quantitative reasoning" used as one of our
core liberal arts values, I find myself identifying four different
kinds of reasoning that I would hope that all modern liberal arts
students [7] posses.

First, there's the literal meaning of "quantitative reasoning";
the ability to reason about quantities.  From my perspective, that
corresponds, in part, to the ability to do the kind of word problems that
are the bane of most middle-school students' existence but are also part
of everyday life.  "If my walls are _these sizes_ and one gallon of paint
covers _this many square feet_, how many gallons of paint do I need?"
The College-level version of this is "mathematical modeling"; the ability
to model complex systems using quantities and formal relationships
between those qualities.  But there's more than modeling; one should
also be able to reason about the size of numbers.  What does it mean,
for example, that someone has a billion dollars or that our national
deficit is in the trillions?

Second, there's the kind of reasoning that the accompanying text
describes, which I might term "formal reasoning".  Can a student work
in a formally described system and follow rules for reasoning and
deduction within that system?  Can a student examine a hypothesis in
such a system and demonstrate its correctness using formal mechanisms.
While we cover that kind of thinking in our proof-oriented courses in
mathematics, students might also get exposure to formal reasoning in a
course in Philosophy [8].

Third, there's the very different kind of reasoning which, for lack of a
better term, I'll call "statistical reasoning" or "reasoning in the face
of uncertainty".  Since Grinnell aims to graduate individuals who can
participate as citizens, they must be able to interpret the data that
they receive and ask the kinds of questions that a Statistician knows
to ask, such as how the data were gathered or processed.  They should
understand _p_ values and their use (and non-use).  They must also be
able to interpret graphs, charts, and the like.  I'd say that Grinnell's
Statistics classes do a particularly good job at helping students
think through these issues, particularly as students design and carry
out their own experiments.  But students can learn many of these skills
in some courses in the social sciences or the natural sciences.

Finally, modern citizens must have some sense of "algorithmic reasoning"
(or "computational thinking" as some term it).  That is, they should
know a bit about how you develop computational models of domains,
specify goals, write algorithms that meet those goals, and analyze
those algorithms.  With the power of computers to change the world,
everyone has an obligation to understand a bit about what we can and
cannot do with computers.

There are, of course, other reasons to study these four disciplines.
Long ago, when I applied to Grinnell, I'm pretty sure that part of
my application packet was an essay on how a core aspect of a liberal
arts education is the opportunity to think in many different ways [9].
Each of these four ways of reasoning provides a different model of
thinking about the world or about problems.

I realize that I'm biased, but I really do think that our students should
experience all four kinds of thinking as part of their undergraduate
careers.  And the four are really different ways of thinking.  Someone
who can model things mathematically or who can design algorithms can't
necessarily think statistically.  Someone who can model the world using
statistics may not be able to prove statements correct in a formal system.
And so on and so forth.

But I guess we accept the same compromises in other elements of the
liberal arts.  For example, there may be a large gap between being able
to create works and to analyze works; a student who has taken only an
art history course is unlikely to be well prepared to paint or sculpt.
Similarly, there's a gap between the artistic disciplines; that art
history student is also unlikely to be able to analyze musical or
theatrical works.  And we accept that a student might only choose one
of these modes of expression or understanding [10].

So what should we do about the "quantitative reasoning" element?  As I
said, I'd like to see a broader conversation in which we unpack that
element a bit.  I'd like to see us more explicitly state that these are
really four different ways of "quantitative reasoning".  And since the
reasoning is not necessarily about quantities, I'd like a better term.
Unfortunately, I can't come up with one right now.  "Reasoning in 
formal systems" is the best I can do [11].

But my perspective is not necessarily comprehensive or useful.  As I said,
I hope this issue is one we'll discuss more.

[5] I'm serious.  While I know that committees are not an ideal vehicle,
multiple voices and perspectives do tend to produce better understanding.
And I'd generally take the product of a committee over whatever a random 
administrator comes up with.

[6] I hope that my perspective ends up being better than that of a
random administrator.  But my worldview is also limited.

[7] And all citizens.

[8] Not just in the courses the specifically deal with abstract systems,
such as Symbolic Logic, but more generally in courses in which students
must reason within a set of constraints.

[9] "And computers certainly 'think' very differently than humans."

[10] Wouldn't it be cool if every Grinnell student had taken courses
in analyzing, understanding, and appreciating visual art, literature,
music (in multiple genres), film, theatre, dance, and more?  Wouldn't it
be equally cool if every student had the opportunity to learn each of
those creative areas in a more formal setting?

[11] Perhaps I should stop making comments about "random administrators".

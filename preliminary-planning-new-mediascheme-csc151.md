Preliminary planning for a new version of the "media scheme" CSC 151
====================================================================

CSC 151 is Grinnell's introductory course in computer science, intended
both as the first course for prospective majors and as a general
interest course for nonmajors [1].  For the past decade, we've made "media
computation" the theme of the course.  More precisely, students learn core
CS principles by writing algorithms that generate and manipulate images.

When we designed the course, our plan was that we would have multiple
versions of the introductory course and that students would choose the
version that best met their interests.  But it's a lot of work to create
a new workshop-style course, particularly when there's no textbook.  In 
particular, we need to write daily readings and daily labs.  In addition,
we found a lot of benefit in teaching parallel sections of the course
as a way to inculcate new faculty in the culture of the department.

Last year, we realized that we would have both faculty repeating the
course.  The College also has a data science initiative.  We also worried
that our old course was not accessible.  And so we proposed designing a
new version of CSC 151 that focuses on data science.  We are in our second
semester of teaching the course.  Parts of the course are going well.
For some students, applying computers to data sets is an interesting
and enjoyable problem.

This year, we instittued 
We have a new version of CSC 151,

* Here's an optional thing: I hear reports from students that they 
  already miss the old version of CSC 151, which focused on algorithms
  for image making.  We switched to the new version for a few reasons,
  one of which was ensuring that the course was accessible to students
  who had vision impairments.  We also thought the new version would be
  equally exciting.  And I think it is, for some students.  But our
  long-term goal is multiple versions.  One thing I've learned from
  the new version is that we're much better off without strange libraries
  I write in C to get DrRacket to communicate to Gimp.  So if we go
  "back" to the old version, we need to do so with something closer
  to DrRacket's built-in image libraries.  I'd like to spend a few
  hours playing with that idea.  This is more fun than work, but it is
  work related.  _[1/2 day]_

[1] We also hope that it will convince some nonmajors to become majors.

Why complain
============

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

Folks may have noticed that I'm prone to complaining, or, as I think of it,
identifying problems.  Some of my colleagues suggest that I should complain
less.  But here's the thing; if no one complains, no one knows that there's
a problem.  And we do have problems that can be fixed.  

For example, when we built the bathrooms for Noyce Phase II, we apparantly
ended up with a designer who does not understand higher education.
The bathrooms ended up with "shelves" that were about six inches deep
[1] and "hooks" that would collapse if you put more than two or three
pounds of weight on them.  I put up with it for awhile.  But I got fed
up with the bad design [2].  So I complained to the appropriate Associate
Dean [3], she checked out the situation, and, within a few weeks, FM had
built and installed shelving and hooks that actually worked.  Raising the
issue had an impact.  Staying silent would have meant additional years
of an inadequate system.

Here's a very different example.  A little more than a year ago,
Communications worked with some local merchants to set up a new online
ordering system for nametags, stationary, and some other things.
As department chair, I asked for and received an account.  Then I looked
at the prices.  I was stunned at how expensive things were.  So I did
the only sensible thing.  I wrote to Kate Walker, our Vice President
of Finance [5,6].  

> I note that the new stationary ordering system has a relatively high
price for envelopes.  If we order 500, which I am told is the typical
order, it's $208.32, which comes out to over 40 cents per envelope.
I'm all for supporting local businesses, but that seems really high!

Kate sensibly passed the question on to our Procurement Manager.  And our
Procurement Manager followed up on the matter.  It turns out that the
costs were supposed to be 500 envelopes for $142.26, 1000 envelopes for
$256.06, and 2500 envelopes for $550.  I know that saving $60 doesn't
seem like much, but when we multiply by the number of departments with
envelopes, it was certainly worth my time to raise the issue and her
time to investigate it.

Unfortunately, my complaints don't always go that smoothly.  I think of
an instance in which I believe the College engaged in unethical behavior,
using information about students in a way that it had promised not to use
that information.  I had to fight to get people to acknowledge that the
misuse had even happened.  I had to convince people that it was unethical
[7].  But I couldn't get anyone in authority to accept responsibility
or to say that they would put safeguards in place to ensure that it
wouldn't happen again.  That frustrates me [8].

I'd rather focus on the successes.

[1] No, that's not enough for, say, the typical textbook or 8.5x11 
notebook that most users of academic buildings tend to carry

[2] In case you didn't know, I care about design.  And, while I value
aesthetics, my primary concern is how well something accomplishes its
purpose.

[3] I miss Dean Sortor.  She was awesome.  She probably still is.  I hope
that she's continuing to do well at St. Olaf.  Maybe she'll apply for open
VPAA [4] position at Grinnell.  

[4] Vice President for Academic Affairs.

[5] I'm not very good at following chain of command.  I also found Kate
more willing than most others to have a thoughtful discussion or at least
to provide a rationale other than "it's that way because it's that way".

[6] I miss Kate Walker.  While I don't agree with everything she did,
she was thoughtful, willing to explain and discuss, and made a positive 
impact on this institution.  Plus, it was fun to see her sing in choir.

[7] Fortunately, the Associate Deans I discussed the matter with understood
my concerns.

[8] If you are an administrator or member of Council and want to know
more, I'm happy to share my concerns.  If you are anyone else, I will
not reveal the details.  I'm upset at the situation, I'm upset at the
way the College failed to deal with it, but I don't think explicit public
discussion will make a difference and may cause greater harm.

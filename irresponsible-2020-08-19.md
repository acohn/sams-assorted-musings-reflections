**This musing is in draft form.  Please do not read it unless I've
asked you to do so.**

It's late summer.  In late summer in the US, school typically begins.
President Harris tells me that it's because we're tied to an agrarian
calendar.  Perhaps that still makes sense, at least in states like
Iowa.

But there's a pandemic on.  That makes things complicated.  It makes
them even more complicated in a state like Iowa, in which the data
have been incorrectly recorded and reported [1].  Since I'm in
higher education, I'm going to consider some issues in higher ed,
although not necessarily in Iowa.

Some schools have been incredibly cautious, saying from early summer
that they would be online this fall.  Others have looked to
compromises, such as low-density campuses, with only one-quarter
to one-half of the students there at any one time, and a mix of
in-person and online classes.  And some, spearheaded by Mitchell
Elias Daniels Jr., who someone became president of Purdue immediately
after serving as governor of Indiana, have been pushing for full
residency and in-person classes.

I get it.  It's not a decision I would make, but I understand the
panic of "We can't afford to stay open unless we get students paying
tuition and room and board" and "Remote education is not equitable"
and "Our local businesses depend on us" and "Many of our students
will be safer on campus than in their homes" and "Impacts on young
people seem to be limited" and things like that.  Well, maybe not
the last explicit statement.  Some young people will still suffer
immediate serious effects and we still don't know the long-term
impact of Covid-19 and SARS-CoV-2.  These young people also interact
with non-young people.

But I get it.  People did a cost-benefit analysis.  They weighed
different issues, probably giving different weights than I would.
They considered scenarios.  At least I hope they did.  These are not
easy decisions.

Since there's some evidence that political leaders make off-the-cuff
decisions and refuse to back off from them, let's take another
Indiana institution as an example.  Notre Dame is a large, wealthy,
research institution.  When they made plans for a time-shifted,
in-person fall, I have to assume that there was a lot of hard
intellectual work at play [2].

You may have noted that I used the term "irresponsible" in the title
of this musing.  I don't consider the in-person, full-capacity plan
to be irresponsible, at least not the broad picture.  As I said, I
have confidence that people thought carefully about issues involved,
particularly since Notre Dame made some changes that suggested that
they were thinking through issues.  For example, the decision to
start in early August and finish by Thanksgiving appears to have taken
into account the dangers of allowing students to leave and return as
well as the likelihood that infection rates will rise in the winter.

Of course, there are many out there who think that full capacity is
irresponsible.  What is it they say?  "If a cruise ship is a petri dish,
a dorm is an incubator full of peetri dishes."  Something like that.

As you may have heard, Notre Dame's hope for a successful in-person
fall have shown to be a bit optimistic.  After passing 100 positive
tests on campus, they've moved to online classes for the next two weeks,
while keeping students on campus.  Let's hope that that keeps things
a bit safer.

One of [the first articles I read about Notre
Dame](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/19/michigan-state-scraps-person-undergraduate-classes-fall-notre-dame-suspends-2-weeks)
included a note that "the universityâ€™s COVID-19 dashboard has shown
a rising number of cases, with 147 confirmed cases since Aug. 3 out
of a total of 927 tests performed."  Only 927 tests out of 12,000
or so students?  That seems irresponsible.  It's also not quite
true.  I see from the aforementioned
[dashboard](https://here.nd.edu/our-approach/dashboard/) that they
required all enrolled students to undergo testing before coming to
campus.  If the dashboard is to be believed, 11,836 tests yielded
33 positive cases [3].  I also see that since the article was published,
the numbers from recent tests show 222 confirmed cases out of 1,287
tests.

So what's irresponsible?  Notre Dame, like the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill and other institutions, is considering sending
students home.  Here's a quotation from the article, which comes
from a [streamed video by the president](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vtKUv7xKGg&feature=youtu.be&t=1207) [4].

> Upon receiving recent results, we began to make plans to send you home and continue instruction online, as we did last spring.

Now that would be irresponsible.  They know that they've spread the disease
to a bunch of students.  They know that some are likely asymptomatic.  And
yet they are considering sending them home to spread the disease to their
home communities?  What are they thinking? 

As I said, it's not just Notre Dame.  [UNC-Chapel Hill is telling
students to go
come](https://www.unc.edu/posts/2020/08/17/shift-to-remote-cm/) [5].
I'm sure that other schools are, too.  If they are not testing each
student before sending them home, recommending that they quarantine
themselves for two weeks when they get home, and providing follow-up
testing, then they are not just irresponsible.  I'd even suggest that
they are responsible, responsible for any further spread.

**_Postscript_**: I had wanted to title this "Inconceivably
irresponsible" or "Irredeemably irresponsible" or something like that.
But those titles seemed excessive, even for this situation and even
for me.

[1] Here's [one example](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2020/08/17/iowa-coronavirus-numbers-skews-results-covid-19-data-glitch/3385665001/).  There are certainly others.  I may even muse on this particular example.

[2] As a non-Catholic, I'll admit that I know more about the intellectual
considerations of Jesuits and Dominicans than about members of the
Congregation of the Holy Cross.  Still, I assume the CSC's members are
also deeply studious.

[3] I assume none of those 33 were allowed to return to campus until they 
no longer tested positive (perhaps with multiple tests).

[4] Tiny little Grinnell can caption its videos.  Why can't Notre Dame?

[5] Arguably, it's telling them that they can return home.  But it 
sounds like it's encouraging them to do so.

On Monday, 18 May 2020, we had a bit of a different graduation
event than normal.

Traditionally, we conduct three separate events associated with
the end of our CS majors' Grinnell careers.  We have a celebration
of CS seniors at Relish [1]; we conduct [the Pledge of the Computing
Professional](http://pledge-of-the-computing-professional.org/) for
interested students (not only CS majors, but also those intending
careers in computing), most frequently immediately after Baccalaureate;
and we have a breakfast for our seniors and their families on the
morning of commencement.

This year, we crammed all of that [2] into a short thirty-minute
cermony.  As happens all too frequently, I got asked to be the
master of ceremonies.  Stuff related to social events often seems
to be my responsibility.

I'm not great at speaking off the cuff [3].  I always forget something
that I intended.  So I'm trying to put my words down in bits in advance,
in the hope that I'll remember, that I'll get things right.  Fortunately,
I have [a speech from 2018](cs-seniors-2018) available [4] as a starting
point.  I'm not sure what I'll keep, what I'll discard, what I'll
rework.  But I need to get something down [5].

Here goes.

**_Part one: Introductory remarks_**

Good morning, good day, good evening, or good whatever time of day
matches wherever you are.  Thank you all for joining us: 2020 grads,
2019.5 grads, parents, families, friends, faculty, zoombombers,
everyone.  I'm Sam Rebelsky, one of the faculty in Grinnell's CS
department, and I've been tasked with giving the opening and closing
remarks for this, our insufficient attempt at celebrating our
graduates.

I should let you know that there are approximately five parts to
our ceremonies.  As in many exams, you will find that the different
parts of this ceremony require different amounts of time and carry
different weights.

Part one: I will begin with some opening remaks.  (Oh, it appears I've begun
those already.)  

Part two: Professor Jerod Weinman, Chair of the Computer Science
Department, will announce the recipients of the department's two
awards Chair Weinman will also announce those graduates who, through
their demonstrated commitment to the discipline and the department
and their strong academic performance at Grinnell in the department,
have received honors in computer science.

Part three: We will conduct the Pledge of the Computing Professional
Ceremony.  Professor Weinman will lead us in that pledge.  We hope that
most of you will participate, but do not feel obligated to do so.

Part four: I will make a few announcements.  What good is a celebration
without a few announcements?

Part five: I wlil make some concluding remarks.  Why me?  I'm not 
sure.  I was the one who was volunteered.

We hope to get you out of here by about 9:30 a.m. Central Daylight
Time so that you have sufficient time to get ready for Grinnell's
Commencement.

Continuing with part the first, I have some remarks that I will address
remarks primarily to our graduates.

Thank you for much for joining us in this celebration.  But my real
thanks are for all that you have brought us in the time you've been
at Grinnell, both physically and remotely.  Individually and
collectively, you have done so much for Grinnell, for the department,
and for each other.  We appreciate the grading, the mentoring, the
tutoring you've done; the resources you've created; the phone and
Web apps you've developed; other software, too: libraries, scripts,
programs large and small; the papers and articles, poems and books
you've written; the outreach you've joined and led; the social
events you've developed or joined; the feedback you've given.  And
so much more.  If I tried to list all of your accomplishments, we'd
still be here tomorrow, and I still wouldn't be done..

I appreciate that so many of you are double majors and that you have
brought concepts from those other majors to our department.
If I count correctly, your class includes double majors with thirteen
other disciplines.  In alphabetical order, they are 
Anthropology,
Biology,
Biological Chemistry,
Chemistry,
Economics, 
German Studies,
GWSS,
Mathematics, 
Music,
Physics,
Political Science,
Sociology, and
Studio Art.
Not a bad set of subjects!  (And sorry if I missed any.)

I hope that most of you chose CS because you found something you
loved about the field, and not for the reasons we've heard from
Kumail Nanjiani '01, who said something like "I majored in CS for
my parents.  I majored in Philosophy for myself."  Flipping the
count, I don't know what to make of the fact that fully half of
this year's eight graduates in Music are also CS majors.  Clearly
the disciplines share something; a love of patterns or of creation,
perhaps?

I don't intend to prioritize our double majors.  We appreciate our
single-majors as much as we appreciate those double majors.  In many
cases, we've particularly valued the ways that the single major has
allowed you to do more in the department and to explore a wide variety
of other topics.

In any case, we are thankful for all of you.  We are very sorry that
your senior year has had to end remotely and that we could not be
together in person for the three events we have combined into today's
celebration.

Jerod Weinman will present the department awards and honors.

**_Part three: Pledge of the Computing Professional_**

Jerod Weinman will lead us in the Pledge of the Computing Professional
ceremony.

**_Part four: Announcements_**

Thank you, Prof. Weinman, for that excellent ceremony.

I am not sure whether or not everyone else is aware, but this year
marks the conclusion of Prof. Weinman's term as Chair of the Computer
Science department.  Next year, I will return as chair.  You can
consider yourselves fortunate to have avoided the chaos that will
once again reign in our department.  In any case, can we please
thank Prof. Weinman for his excellent service as chair in a time of
complexities and continued growth.

[Other announcements that should not be public have been elided.]

**_Part five: Final remarks_**

If you've been keeping track, we are now at part five, the final part
of the ceremony.

Let me begin with with a comment to the parents and families here.
Thank you so much for sharing your children and siblings with us.
I know that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that it has
been a true privilege to teach them and to watch them grow.  We
wish that we could have celebrated their achievements with you.

Let us now return to some more comments to the graduates.

We wish you the best in the many careers you choose.  I'll remind
you that there are many things you can do with a CS degree.  While
we have many graduates in the computing industry, we also have
graduates who are helicopter pilots, physicians, fund raisers, and
professional comedians.  Please do not feel constrained by your
major.

I must also say once again that computing technology has great
power, power to change the world.  As technologists, you have
responsibility to think about the technologies you build or contribute
to.  I hope that our conversations at CS table, in our classes, and
in the hallway have gotten you to think more about the risks of
computing and your own relationship to those risks.

While we are sorry to see you go, we also revel in knowing that you
are going on to new and exciting things.  Please drop us a note from
time to time to let us know how and what you are doing.

Take care and be well.

Now get out there and graduate!

[1] Since Relish is closing, this was to be our last year of having
the celebration there.  I'm not sure where else in town would hold 
all of our department and let us take over the place.

[2] Except the food.

[3] I'm not good at speaking in cuffs, either.

[4] I don't know what happened to 2019.

[5] More precisely, I needed to get something down.  I recorded my intent
in this musing, gave the speeches, and then posted the musing.

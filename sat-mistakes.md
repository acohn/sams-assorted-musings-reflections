SAT mistakes
============

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

We signed Youngest Son up for the SAT subject tests today.  One of the
things we hard to agree to read as follows.

> I understand that if I elect to make changes to my registration after submission, that a change fee may be charged. A change fee is charged for changing the test date, the test center, or when changing from the SAT or SAT with Essay to SAT Subject tests or visa versa.

You think that the College Board would know how to spell "vice versa".  Or
perhaps they are referring to a new kind of Visa card.

Postscript:  Youngest Son did find "visa versa" on
[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/visa_versa).  Wiktionary says,

> Misspelling of vice versa.

Grinnellians you should know (or know about): Rachel Swoap '19
==============================================================

*Part of an ongoing series about the strange creatures who inhabit
or have previously inhabited or should inhabit this strange bubble
in the middle of the Iowa plains.*

In this series, I've written about alumni I know, about alumni I don't
know, about current faculty, about current staff, about former staff,
and even about administrators.  But there are a few groups I've left out,
including emeritus faculty, former faculty, and individual students.
In this essay, I address someone from one of those groups.

I'd like to introduce you to Rachel Swoap '19, a second-year student
at Grinnell.  I don't know Rachel incredibly well, since she's only been
at Grinnell a little more than a year and I've only had her in one class.
Nonetheless, she's the kind of student I'm thrilled to have at Grinnell.

I was going to write that "I'm not quite sure what led Rachel to take CSC
151", but then I remembered: [Katya](katya-gibel-mevorach.html) was her
advisor, and Katya (a) likes to encourage her students to take classes
that will challenge them and (b) seems to think highly of my classes
(probably because we're the two faculty on campus who most encourage our
students to attend [Scholars' Convocation](convocation.html).  Anyway,
for whatever reason, Rachel ended up in my class.  

I think I can summarize Rachel's response to CS with two adjectives
and one repeated adverb: really hard and really fun.  Now, Rachel is
not alone in finding CS really fun, nor is she alone in finding CS
really hard.  But she handled those two reactions a bit differently
than most students.  First, she was openly enthusiastic.  I can easily
recall Rachel's exclamations of "This is so cool!"  More importantly,
she knew that when she found things challenging, she should rely on
our various resources.  Other students do that, too.  However, what
really set Rachel apart from her peers is that she made it her
responsibility to make sure that others took advantage of resources.
Students would regularly tell me that they showed up for my review
sessions or evening mentor sessions because "Rachel said these were
so great that I had to come."

Beyond those characteristics, what made (and makes) Rachel a student
I appreciate was her great enthusiasm for the activities I encouraged
students to participate in outside of class.  She was a regular attendee
at convocation (well, she did have Katya as a Tutorial prof), and also
regularly raved about the cool things she learned at convo.  I could
also count on Rachel to attend her peer's events and support them.
Then she'd come back to class and talk to other students about the
opportunity they missed.  I wish all students were even half as excited
about these kinds of co-curricular opportunities!

It's been almost a year since Rachel finished CSC 151, and I'm thrilled
to see that she retains her enthusiam for CS, her enthusiam for learning,
and her enthusiam for encouraging other students to share in these things.
The other day, I watched her gently encourage a friend to remain in CS,
and I know that she's been trying to get other students to more regularly
attend convo.  From what I can tell, she's also been a really good
PCPOP mentor.

Rachel has also found another enthusiam that seems almost equal to her
enthusiasm for CS (or perhaps greater than that enthusiasm): studio art.
I expect that she finds the same joy of creation in studio art that
I find.  I also see her approaching art much the same way she approaches
CS: with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of effort.  For a recent project,
she must have sorted, peeled, melted, and recast a few thousand crayons.
It's an amazingly ambitious undertaking (and probably one I would have
tried if I ever had free time again).

I'm always amazed at what dual CS/Studio Art majors come up with.  I
understand the combination: Both disciplines are about disciplined
creativity.  But the two clearly build upon each other, and dual majors
often create really unique works.

Stay tuned for when Rachel graduates in a few years, and I report on
the rest of her career.

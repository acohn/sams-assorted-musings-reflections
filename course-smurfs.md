Course SMURFs
=============

*Topics/tags: [Teaching](index-teaching), assessment, silly, short*

The other day, our department was
divvying up [the various tasks for members of our
department](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/drupal6/departmental-tasks-2018-2019).
We got to the position of "evaluation coordinator" and started discussing
the tasks associated with that role.  I suggested that our coordinator
might encourage the faculty in the department to develop a list of
goals or outcomes for each class.  As I was saying that, I realized I
had forgotten what term is currently in vogue [1] , so I said something
like "goals, outcomes, SMURFs, whatever we call them these days" [2].
Unfortunately, one of my colleagues asked me to explain the acronym.
I admitted that it was made up, but I also attempted to come up with
an explanation for the acronym.  I'm not quite sure what I said at the
time, but I've decided that a SMURF is a "Specific, Measurable, Useful,
Relevant Factor" for the class.  That is,

SMURFs are *Specific*.  When writing a SMURF, you should focus on the
details of the class, rather than general issue.  Not "I will teach
my students how to think algorithmically", which is a broad concept,
but "My students will learn how to use conditionals, loops, and
sequencing to develop and express algorithms formally".  Not "I will
teach my students to write better" but "My students will learn how
to use the twenty basic sentence patterns [3] to vary their writing
and therefore write more clearly and compellingly [4].

SMURFs are *Measurable*.  What's the point of a student learning something
that you can't measure? [5]

SMURFs are *Useful*.  NEEDS MORE

Finally, SMURFs are *Relevant*.  That could mean relevant to the particular
class that you're teaching, it could mean that it's relevant to the student,
or it could mean that it's relevant to society.  I'll let you choose your
own interpretation.

And there you have it.  A brand new tool for reflecting on your classes.
Don't forget to include your course SMURFs before submitting that syllabus
to the Dean's office.

Postscript: While I did not spend deep thought on the five letters of
the acronym, I did come up with other possibilities.  "S" could stand for
"Significant" rather than "Specific".  "S" could also stand for
a different sense of "specific", specific to the class, rather than
applicable to other classes.  "M" could stand for "Meaningful".  We would,
of course, like our students to find meaning in what they learn and our
faculty to find meaning in what they teach.  But measurement seems to
be at the heart of requirements to list goals and outcomes [6].  Hence,
I wanted to include it in the acronym.    "U" could stand for "Unique".
Like the second sense of "specific", "Unique" suggests that the SURF is
tied to the particular course.  Finally, "R" could stand for "Required".
That is, we should focus on the learning factors we expect for every
student, not just for some.

Postscript: While Smurf is undoubtedly a registered trademark, SMURF is
not.  Trademarks only apply to particular domains (trades).  I don't think 
learning factors interfere with children's toys or the animated films
that advertise those toys.

[1] Yes, I realize that there's a difference between learning goals
and learning outcomes; part of my question was which we are currently
expected to emphasize .

[2] No, I can't always explain the things that my brain comes up with
in the spur of the momement.

[3] A few of my colleagues use _The Art of Styling Sentences_, which
describes twenty basic sentence patterns.

[4] I would not really recommend the latter.  In every class that I've
taught, I've found that the students exhibit different levels of writing
ability; what I help one student with might be different than what I"d
help another with.  In point of fact, I think that "My students will learn
to write better" is a perfectly fine goal.

[5] Note that I believe that we do and should teach things that we
cannot easily measure.  I'm just echoing the repeated calls from our
Dean's office for "measurable outcomes".  Too many of the things that
I care about don't have natural measures and, in any case, the measures
are different for different students.  I've already mentioned writing.
How do you easily quantify the growth in writing we see in students
over the semester?  We should not measure sentence length or rely on
computational "readability" metrics that typically ignore issues we
care about, like style.  How do I measure the transformation I see in a
student who begins the semester asking, "I don't what other students to
slow me down, can I just do everything on my own?" and ends the semester
as a fierce advocate of pair programming?

[6] And SMURFs.

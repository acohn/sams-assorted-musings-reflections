The start of my day was, well, interesting.  And yes, I know that
"interesting" is a word that I shouldn't use.  Perhaps "erroneous".
Or "difficult".  Or just "not as I intended".  How did my day start?
Let's see.

About two weeks ago, I wrote to ask permission to visit my research lab.
You see, my students and I are reviving a project from six years ago and
some of the key data for that project are on a computer in my lab that is
supposed to be on the Internet but wasn't.  It never rebooted after one
of the many power failures of the past few years and, well, turning it
back on wasn't a high priority [1].

I didn't hear a response for about a week and a half, so I wrote again.
It turns out that I *did* get a response, but not from the person who
receives requests.  The response had been lost in my mailbox for that
time.  I kept searching for "mail from this-person" and didn't see any.
But once we'd worked things out, I was able to get permission to visit
the building on Monday morning from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., using
my normal entrance.

This morning, I rushed through lots of tasks as I got ready to go.  I
tried to send email to a bunch of faculty; Word Online wouldn't let
me save.  I tried to log in to check my responsibilities for AP CSP
grading.  Parts of responses wouldn't show up.  Have I mentioned how
much I hate computers?

Now, along with picking up the server, I also wanted to drop off a
computer.  In late March, someone doing their spring cleaning found
an old Mac or two that they wanted to donate to the CS department
museum.  I picked them up.  And they've been sitting in my trunk ever
since.  Maybe "sitting in" is an understatement.  Since one of them
was one of those ginormous cathode-ray-tube monitors from the good
old days, they more or less filled the trunk.

So I did what I normally do.  I unloaded the minivan at the loading
dock, drove over to what I think of as the Noyce Parking Lot [3],
parked, and walked back to the loading-zone entrance.  Then I called
Safety to let me in.  Unfortunately, it turns out that the loading-zone
entrance is now only an exit, so they couldn't let me in.  That meant
I got to lug the ginormous monitor, the smaller computer, and the
paper cutter over to one of the other doors.  Did I not mention the
paper cutter?  Oh, it's been sitting in my minivan for even longer
than the computer.  I'm not sure how it ended up there, but it belongs
in my lab.

Can you guess what happened next?

No, I did not manage to cut myself on the paper cutter.  However, given
how the morning was going, it seemed like a strong possibility.  Rather,
I discovered that the combination of (a) being out of shape and (b)
wearing a mask with a filter that reduces my oxygen flow, results in
(c) Sam rapidly getting out of breath.  Nonetheless, I made it to the
door and they buzzed me in.  Then I got to haul everything back by
the loading dock to the elevator.

Is that it?  Let's see.  What are the errors?  Miscommunication
resulting in a delay.  Check.  Closed street requiring windy path.
Check.  Storing a computer in my trunk for two-and-a-half months.
Check.  Assuming that the loading zone entrance is to be used for
loading.  Check.  Neglecting to maintain my health.  Check.  It
feels like there's one more.

Oh, yeah.  I woke up at 2 a.m. last night and said to myself "Sam, when
you evacuated your office to move to 1127, didn't you ask ITS to take
away all of your old computers?"  Damn.  I recall putting at least to
on the "to take away pile".  I think that's all I had.

As you may guess, while I was enthusiastic about my chance to visit
the lab, I was a bit reluctant to go because I was worried about what
I would find or, more precisely, what I wouldn't find.

Now, you may not know about my lab.  My lab puts my office to shame.
On good days, it is barely navigable.  And that's before I moved about
half the stuff that was in my office into my lab for sabbatical.  So
the first tasks were to find some floor space for the computers [4].
In doing so, I discovered something important that Middle Son had left
in my office.  Where was it?  In one of those cheap plastic grocery
bags, under a box, looking like trash.  The box was other stuff he'd
left in my lab, so I moved it and the plastic grocery bag stuff to
the hallway to take home later.

I didn't want to face up to the possibility that the server was
gone so I did the only rational thing: I started straightening.  Of
course, I also had to straighten to attempt to find the server;
there was a pile of stuff in front of the table I thought it was
under.  I also needed to clear off the top of that table so that I
had a workspace.  At least that's what I told myself.  What did I
end up picking up?  Books.  Lots of books.  Lots of distracting
books.  Or is that redundant?  I identified a dozen or so to take
home [6] on the off chance that I'll find time to read.  I also
found something I'd been looking for for a while.  My lab eats things.
I'd been meaning to clean it up during spring break but, well, I
was banned from campus for spring break.

I was wishing I had time to work on the lab [7].  Then I remembered
that I had intended to grab some books from my former office [8].
I'm teaching a Tutorial on liberal education this fall [9].  I have
a bookshelf full of books on higher education and related issues.
It seemed appropriate to pull out some that might be relevant.  I
also wanted to dig through my too-many books on writing and teaching
writing.  I ended up with a larger stack than I had intended [10].

At that point, I realized that my time was starting to run out.  So
I looked on the floor where the server used to be, identified a
similar-looking computer, and started the next process.  I found a
monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse, attached them to the machine I
thought was the server, and turned it on.  Or maybe I first worried
that there was nothing attached to it.  That seems like a bad sign.
It booted.  Into Xubuntu.  Why Xubuntu?  I'm not sure.  And the
login screen was for Youngest Son.  My first inclination was to say
"Oh, it's one of those old computers that he was playing around
with.  I guess I'll need to look some more."  But I checked, and
there were other logins, including one for Glimmer, my research
lab.  I surprised myself by remembering a six-year-old password
that I haven't used for six years.  And, lo and behold, it *was*
the server I was looking for.  

Unfortunately, even though it was plugged into a network port, it
did not seem connected to the network.  And I'm not sure ITS would
want a server with a six-year-old OS plugged into the Grinnell
network.  So I packed it up to bring it home.

I am fortunate to have some amazing children.  Once I got it home,
Youngest Son was able to get the server running and even attached
to the Internet.  Port forwarding on our router is a pain, so I'm
impressed that he was able to figure it out [11].  We didn't leave
it attached; I may have less to protect than ITS, but I do still worry
about network security.  But I think we'll be able to try it out with
my lab tomorrow or Wednesday.

And that's the story of my morning.  I spent the rest of my day
checking on AP exams, fomenting revolution, meeting with my students,
and other things like that.

While the start of the day makes me want to say "I hope that my next
visit to the lab goes better", that doesn't seem to be appropriate;
the visit was quite successful.  Maybe I'll just say "I hope that my
next visit to the lab comes soon."

Next up: Figuring out how to get Physics to take and fix the laser 
cutter in my lab, while still maintaining my access to it.  Of maybe
just finding another space for it.

[1] It had been something I intended to do after spring break, but we
all know what happened after spring break [2].

[2] If you are reading this sometime in the far future, I should note
that a pandemic struck in early 2020, and Grinnell responded by (a) sending
students home and (b) forbidding most people from entering academic 
buildings.  That "no visit" policy lasted through at least mid-June.

[3] It has another name.

[4] If I were smarter, I'd have asked for permission to visit my other
office to get my CS submaster so that I could have moved them to museum
storage.  I wonder if there's still room in museum storage.  I wonder
who's taking over the museum.  I wonder wonder who, who wrote the book
of love [5].

[5] I am annoyed by the song lyrics that invade my brain.  I'm
sharing them with you so that you may share in the annoyance.

[6] Sorry, Micki.

[7] I may have chaotic spaces, but I do prefer them to be somewhat clean.
I just lack the time to make them that way.

[8] Or maybe I was still delaying the inevitable.

[9] At least I expect to be teaching a Tutorial on liberal education
this fall.  We're still working out the revised schedule for those
seven-and-a-half-week units that we are now calling "terms".

[10] Sorry Micki.

[11] Non-technical people can ignore that comment.

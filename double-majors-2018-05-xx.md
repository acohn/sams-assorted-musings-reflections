Double majors
=============

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), liberal arts*

In the past year or so, we've had a lot of conversations about student
course selections at Grinnell.  Because Grinnell has an individually
advised curriculum with no general education requirements beyond
the Tutorial [1], we regularly ask ourselves whether all [2] of our
students are getting a good liberal arts education.  This past year,
a few additional factors have helped spur those discussions.  First,
we are anticipating the College's regular re-accreditation review
and therefore expect that the reviewers will ask about it.  Second,
we have seen a gradual increase in the number of students enrolling in
science courses and majoring in the sciences.  Third, we have the strange
[course tag](course-tags-2018-03-30) initiative [3].

In many of those conversations, I've heard people decry double majors
in general and double majors within the same division in particular.
At at least two recent faculty meetings, Dean Latham has raised the
question of whether we should disallow double majors in the ame division.

As [I've written previously](double-majors), there are many incentives,
both real and imagined, for students to choose double majors.  Some majors,
like Music, provide additional opportunities only for their majors [4].
Some majors, like Economics, Biology, and Computer Science, experience
enough demand for their upper-level classes that enrollment in those
courses is effectively restricted to majors in those disciplines [5].
And, of course, students and their parents believe that credentialing
is important.

At first glance, it might seem that a double major restricts your options.
And it does, a bit.  But Grinnell majors are supposed to consist of
only eight courses [6].  Two eight-course majors leaves you sixteen
courses to take outside the major.  Even if you add say, four courses
of stealth requirements, that's twelve courses outside the major (which
could represent six each in the other two divisions if the two majors
are in the same division).  In practice, you may not have that much
freedom because some departments won't count study-abroad credits toward
the major, even if they appear related.  But that's a separate issue.

So I don't think double majors are at fault when students have narrow
curricula.  I also don't think that division should be our determining
factor when deciding whether or not to allow a double major.  I was
reading in the Senior Issue of the _Scarlet and Black_ about a Studio
Art and English double major.  Both of those disciplines are in the
humanities.  I don't think they have much in common in terms of their
approach to the world.  I also know from experience that a Computer
Science and Mathematics feel no more closely related than Computer Science
and Economics or Mathematics and Economics.  Yet a divisional restriction
would allow CS/Econ double majors and disallow CS/Math double majors.

If we have concerns about the curricula that double majors are choosing,
and we might, then we should address the issue through additional
requirements (e.g., that double majors take at least four courses in
each division [7]) rather than by restricting their ability to declare
two majors.  And, if we're really concerned about some double majors,
we need to remove as many incentives as we can.  Telling a student "You
can't declare a CS major and, because of that, you can't take upper-level
classes in CS" seems unfair.

We all can't remove all incentives.  Remember what Kumail Nanjiani
'01 said: "I majored in CS for my parents.  I majored in Philosophy for
myself."  As importantly, we should remember that the STEM OPT "bribe"
is important for our international students.

I've suggested alternative approaches in the past.  We'd have fewer double
majors if there were other ways for students to achieve credentials, such
as minors, and other ways for them to get into interesting and high-demand
upper-level courses, such as providing sufficient staffing for those 
departments or courses [8].  

Rather than targeting double majors, let's think more broadly about 
our structures.

These notes are from the _forthcoming musings_.  I should consider whether
there are any parts to put in the musing above.

Double majors.  Something the faculty are discussing and should be
discussing.  I support the availability of double majors, including
double majors within a division.  Why?  We have small majors.  An
eight-course/32 credit major may be as small as a minor at some other
institutions.  [Insert normal disclaimer about hidden requirements.]
And the idea of delving deep into more than one discipline can be
a natural part of a liberal arts education.  I'd prefer that the
disciplines be very different, but I'm certainly willing to listen
to arguments about why disciplines that are in the same division
are different.  Divisional classifications are arbitrary.  I'd say,
for example, that Classics and Studio Art are no nearer to each other
than, say, CS and Economics, even though Classics and Studio Art are
in the same division and CS and Economics are in different divisions.
I see some benefit to having double majors as a recruitment tools.
("Grinnell has compact majors, which allows you to delve deeply into
two different disciplines.")  I don't see double majors as our primary
obstacle to our students having a broad liberal arts education.  That
said, I would certainly pair double majors with my proposed "Defend
your liberal arts curriculum" approach, or anything else that encourages
students to think more deeply about the goals and purposes of their
liberal arts education and to demonstrate that they have achieved
such an education.

[1] Grinnell's Tutorial is a small (12-13 students) seminar-style class
that allows students to delve deeply into a topic while developing various
college-level skills, particularly writing skills.

[2] Or enough.

[3] The course tag initiative appears to be primarily intended to
satisfy our external reviewers.  Faculty don't have ready access
to the course tags to use in advising.

[4] Music majors can take multiple lessons free of charge.  

[5] There are a few slots available for non-majors, but those are not
predictable.

[6] Many majors add a few additional requirements, such as some mathematics
or statistics, or don't count the first-year of courses.

[7] With some additional work to appropriately count non-divisional
courses like Linguistics and Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies.

[8] Was that snarky?  Oh well.  The "majors only" limitation wasn't
something my department faced previously.  I recall so many "honorary
CS majors" who didn't complete a full major but took our upper level
classes.  I'm sorry that we can't support as many as we used to.  I'm
pretty sure that the other departments who encounter these issues feel
the same way.

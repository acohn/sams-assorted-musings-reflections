My sabbatical is over.  I'm not quite sure when it ended, either
officially or unofficially.  In mid-March, I started taking on a
variety of additional administrative responsibilities.  And the
whole pandemic thing made me a much less productive worker [1].  So
we could call that the unofficial end.  Sabbaticals are for the
academic year [2], so we might say that it ended somewhere between
the middle and the end of May.  It was certainly done by the time
I started with my MAP students.

Although the sabbatical is over, the tasks associated with the
sabbatical are not yet finished.  In particular, my sabbatical
report is due in the Dean's office on July 1, along with my annual
[Faculty Activities
Report](https://grinnell.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8jZEe0smltgLmhD).

My sabbatical was less successful than I had planned.  A number of
issues contributed to that status.  In part, I was much more burned
out than I realized; I needed much of the fall to recover [3].
Fortunately, fall was not officially part of my sabbatical; I had
a one-semester sabbatical and then time-off that was paid for by a
course overload I had taken previously [4].  I started spring
semester with a medical issue that occupied too much of my attention.
And then the second-half of spring semester was, well, the pandemic.
I also did less well at staying away from campus issues than I
should have; I attended department meetings [5], division meetings
[6], and faculty meetings [7].  I participated in discussions and
attended campus events.  But I'm also at a point in my career in
which I think I serve the College better by participating in such
discussions than, say, by making additional progress on my research
projects.

I feel bad that I achieved too little of what I intended in my
sabbatical.  But there's value in being open.  After all, that's
one of the many reasons I muse regularly.  So I'm being open about
the (lack of) achievement in this musing, and I'll be open about
what I did and did not do in my report [8].  The report is due
tomorrow.  I guess I should draft it today.  Fortunately, I have
[a draft of my original proposal](sabbatical-2019-draft) available
for reference.  It's hard to believe that I wrote it ten months go.

Other aspects of my sabbatical plan were personal, rather than
institutional.  I wanted to organize my books.  That didn't happen,
although I did come up with a book box design and made a dozen or
so.  I wanted to clean my lab.  That didn't happen, in part because
I couldn't visit my lab for the spring.  I wanted to work on my
health.  My mental health was better.  However, as I noted earlier,
the crush of the pandemic and Grinnell's fall planning have negative
impacts.

But I've done some organization, both of my physical world and my
electronic world; it may just be hard for others to tell.  I've had
more time to things I enjoyed.  I had time to start gardening this
summer.  I've been able to muse [9].  So, while it could have 
been better, it was worthwhile.  And I think it's set me up well
for my next leave.

It may be hard to tell, but I think I've also become more positive in
my dealings with others, particularly my email dealing with others.
I can still be unpleasant.  But it happens less often.  I try to express
my thanks [10] and to acknowledge the difficulties others face.  I
try to stay away from things that probably aren't my domain.  I hope
others feel that I'm doing better.  And if that's the only outcome of
this sabbatical [11], I think it's a valuable one.

[1] Not that I was all that productive to begin with.

[2] Arguably, mine was for one semester.

[3] While I feel like I recovered, I worry how much the combination of
the pandemic and Grinnell's pandemic-associated complexities will wear
me down.

[4] One of the many contributors to my burnout.

[5] Fewer than I would have if I wasn't on sabbatical.

[6] Fewer than I would have if I wasn't on sabbatical.

[7] Fewer than I would have if I wasn't on sabbatical.

[8] I'm a tenured full professor who is also serving as Department Chair
of one of the most popular majors.  I would not recommend this approach
for everyone.

[9] I mentioned that in the report, didn't I?

[10] Even when I'm frustrated with others, I'm thankful for the hard
work that they do.

[11] It's not.

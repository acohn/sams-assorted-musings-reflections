Volunteering for NESFA
======================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

I'm not sure why my muse had me write this musing since it's probably only 
of interest to me. But perhaps the kids would want to know. 

The other day, I noticeda car parked in front of historical museum
driveway, blocking the driveway.  My brain said, "Remember when you
accidentally parked in front of a driveway and your car was towed?"
And I remembered.

It was one of those months when I was volunteering to help with the
NESFA (New England Science Fiction Association) â€˜zine [1] What does
that mean?  Well, back in the misty depths of time [2] SF [3] fans
kept in touch with each other, in part, by writing regular "newsletters"
of sorts.  Each newsletter might have reviews of books and other
media, short stories, chapters in an ongoing saga, reports on gaming
experiences, or whatever the author thought was of interest to
others.  If you mimeographed a bunch of your newsletter and sent
the stack to NESFA, a group of people, myself included, would collate
all the individual newsletters into a larger stack, staple them
together, and then send them out.

Or at least that's what I remember.  

Helping out with the newsletter was fun; I met interesting people
and built community.  It meant that I knew people when I attended
Boskone [4] And the informal friendships continued.  I still recall
spending a train ride from Boston to Chicago for the 1982 WorldCon
in which we spent the whole ride talking and playing games [5].
Since I started college [6] that fall, I stayed in Chicago afterwards,
in a guest room at my mom's friends, Clemens and Judy Roothan's
house [7].

I'm pretty sure that I kept all of those old newsletters until mom
moved out of her house.  I wish I had moved them to Grinnell, if
only to give them to the UIowa archive of SF fandom.  Oh well.  I
must have a few around in the basement.

[1] Or whatever they called the assemblage.

[2] That is, late 1970's/early 1980's .

[3] Never SciFi.

[4] I'm supposed to be a life member to Boskone.  Whatever happened
to that membership?  I haven't taken advantage of it in more than
thirty years, but I am still alive.

[5] I have no memory of what games we played, other than Cosmic
Wimpout.

[6] The College at The University of Chiago, to be precise.

[7] I never realized quite how distinguished Clemens was; I spent
most of my time there with Judy.

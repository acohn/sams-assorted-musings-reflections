Privacy and PCards
==================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), [Grinnell](index-grinnell)*

A few of my readers have asked for more details about [my most recent
rant about PCard policies](grumpy-2018-10-04), particularly my complaint
that "Student Affairs mucked with the PCard Privacy Policy" [1].  So
it appears that I should explain a bit more.

Every Grinnell student, faculty member, staff member, and administrator
has a "Pioneer One Card", which we refer to as a "PCard" [2].  I expect
that most institutions of higher education now issue such cards.
It serves as an identification card, a "key" for many electronic locks,
and a connection to some databases on campus, such as the one maintained
by Dining Services.  That is, you can "swipe your PCard" when you enter the
dining hall and it will verify that you have an appropriate dining
plan, take a meal off of your accumulated meal count, charge your
dining dollar account, or, perhaps, decrease your stash of PCash [4].

When Grinnell first discussed introducing the PCard system, some
faculty members [5] raised concerns about privacy issues, particularly
regarding the building entrance information.  We did not think the
College should be able to trace when people were entering buildings.
ITS and the administration assured us that the data would be treated
as confidential, used only for issues of safety or security.  For some,
any use of the information was inappropriate.  But most of us accepted
that there are a few cases in which we want to find out if a student is
safe and the data can be helpful.

And that's where things stood for a decade or more [6].

Then, two years ago [7], I heard someone discuss a way in which they had
used building entrance data that did not involve safety or security.  And
I worried.  So I looked at the policies.  I was surprised to find that we
had two different policies.

The Pioneer One-Card Committee had the following statement about privacy.

> Guidelines for Accessing the Electronic Locking System

> 1. If a student, faculty, or staff would like access to or information from the electronic locking system, they must get approval through the Office of Student Affairs or the Vice President of Business and Treasurer of the College.

> 2. The electric locking information will only be used in case of emergencies and security issues (example --- locating a lost or missing student, tampering with the system, damaging the system, or investigating a crime).

While not ideal, the policy includes the two components I would expect.
First (well, second), it limits the usage of the data to "emergencies
and security issues".  Second (well, first), it makes sure that there's
a clear process for identifying something as being an emergency or
security issue: either Student Affairs (for students, I assume) or a
high-level administrator must approve the use.

I was surprised to find that the _Student Handbook_ had a different
phrasing.

> The electronic locking information will only be used in case of
emergencies and security or safety issues (example: locating a lost
or missing student, damaging the system, or investigating a crime,
or when authorized by the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs
or designee).

I did the natural thing [8].  I asked the faculty representative on the
PCard Committee and the chair of the PCard Committee about the differences
and the reasons for the change.  It turned out that the Committee had never
discussed changing the text and they weren't sure why it had changed in
the _Student Handbook_.

So I asked Student Affairs.  I was told (approximately), "We're in
charge of the policies in the _Student Handbook_.  We can make changes
as we like."  While I'm not sure that's an appropriate statement [9],
I took it at face value.

But conflicting policies are problematic.  So I asked the PCard commitee
to clarify the different policies for students and faculty/staff.
Unfortunately, someone in ITS decided to just move the _Student Handbook_
policy into the official PCard policy and to do so without public
discussion.  

That appears to violate principles of shared governance.

Now we have a less clear policy and one that does not appear to apply
as naturally to staff and faculty.  Why, for example, should the Associate
Vice President for Student Affairs get to decide whether a faculty or
staff member's data are necessary for determining a security issue?
And, given that it says "*or* when authorized", it seems that the policy
permits *anyone* to decide that something is a security issue.

Remember that ethically suspect use of the building entrance data that
started this whole process?  Neither the old policy nor the new policy
should permit it [10].  But we don't have protections in place.  Hence,
someone was able to get building entrance data for something that involved
neither an emergency or a safety issue.

Why has it that two years have passed and no one has done anything
about it?  I have no idea.  But it frustrates me.  And when I'm in a more
paranoid mood, something in the back of my head says that it's because
our new HR regime wants to be able to look at staff entrance data and
that our Office of Analytic Support and Institutional Research wants to
look at student entrance data.  Perhaps the delay is because they are
trying to write a policy that permits those organizations to use data
how they want.  But I really do think that's a paranoid perspective;
I expect that people just don't consider it a priority.

It also strikes me that this is yet another symptom of what I see as
an increasing tendency among administrators to make changes without
either consultation or careful consideration of consequences.  It also
reflects the tendency of those same administrators to decide that it's
not their responsibility to deal with those aforementioned consequences.

Or maybe I'm just a curmudgeon.

I really wanted this to be a year in which I sent no complaints to
Dean Latham or to Council.  In musing about the issue, I realized that
both the privacy and the governance issues worry me enough that I see
no alternative.  Here's the letter I sent yesterday, slightly modified
for public release.

Dear Dean Latham and Council Members,

I write to you with long-standing concerns about our PCard Privacy Policy.  These concerns have come to the forefront with the creation of a new building entrance system and the message about new PCards.  I ask you to address them before we are asked to get new PCards.  (I had hoped not to send concerns to you while on leave; the timing of the building entrance system announcement makes that difficult.)

From Fall 2001 to early Fall 2016, the College had a clear policy about the use of building entrance data.

> Guidelines for Accessing the Electronic Locking System

> 1. If a student, faculty, or staff would like access to or information from the electronic locking system, they must get approval through the Office of Student Affairs or the Vice President of Business and Treasurer of the College.

> 2. The electric locking information will only be used in case of emergencies and security issues (example --- locating a lost or missing student, tampering with the system, damaging the system, or investigating a crime).

That statement had two important characteristics: It required approval by an appropriate body and it limited the use to emergencies and security issues.

Two years ago, in October 2016, the policy was changed without public discussion (and, as I understand it, with no real input from the PCard Committee).  It now reads [11],

> The Building Access policy is stated in the Campus Life Policies section of the Student Handbook. The 2016-17 policy states â€“

> "The electronic locking information will only be used in case of emergencies and security or safety issues (example: locating a lost or missing student, damaging the system, or investigating a crime, or when authorized by the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs or designee)."

I have a few concerns about the change and about the policy more generally.

1. It no longer appears to require that an appropriate body verify that the use is for "emergencies and security or safety issues".  The language "or when authorized" suggests that such authorization is optional.

2. It is not at all clear to me why decisions about faculty and staff building entrance data should be under the auspices of the AVP for Student Affairs; those should be the purview of an appropriate administrator.

3. Even with these policies in place, building access data were made available for a use that had nothing to do with safety or security.  That suggests that our mechanisms for enforcing the policies are lacking.

4. The policies were changed without public discussion or announcement.  That strikes me as a violation of shared governance, particularly as there is a committee that is supposed to be in charge of PCard policies and that committee did not appear to have input.

When I discovered these issues two years ago, I asked for them to be addressed.  Two years have passed, and there are no changes.  We are now being asked to accept a new PCard with unclear privacy protections and with evidence of an insufficient data protection mechanism.  I ask that you address the issue of the policies and, if you consider it appropriate, the apparent violation of shared governance.  

Regards,

\-\- SamR

Did I mention that I'm sick of having to be the one who raises these
issues?  I don't think the issue is that no one else cares.  Rather,
something about my brain lead me to notice these issues more often than
other people.  Or, more realisticly, it's like that others don't care
as much as I do.  Perhaps I should learn to let issues like this drop.
It might make me happier.

Postscript: After I wrote this musing, I discovered I started one on a similar
topic when I first encountred the problem.  I then updated it in May, 2017.
Here's what I had written.

> It's graduation weekend.  I wasn't intending to rant.  Rather, I
was intending to write nice things about the graduating seniors [12].
But then I got a response to my question about data privacy and the
Pioneer One-Card system.  Here's an approximation of the answer: "It
appears that you are correct that we should revisit the issue of access to
Pioneer One-Card data.  However, the P-Card committee is not the group to
do so, since they have no governance or oversight responsibilities [14].
We will consider these issues as part of our broader consideration of
information security and data governance."

> Now, I'm glad that we are beginning a broader consideration of
information security and data governance.  It's about time.  I hope that
there is faculty representation involved.

Whoops!  I guess I should not have explained the governance issue in the
way that I did.  But "The P-Card committee has no governance or oversight
responsibilities" doesn't tell me who does.  As far as I can tell, they
don't think any group has oversight responsibilities over the data.
That's a problem.

[1] A few also asked about the ethical violation.  As I said, I won't
write about that in public.

[2] "Pioneer" often gets shortened to "P".  For example, our installation
of Blackboard is called "Pioneer Web", but almost everyone refers to it
as "PWeb" [3].  Now I find myself wondering why we didn't call our
SharePoint instance "Pioneer Share", rather than "GrinnellShare" or
"GrinCo".

[3] Two syllables.

[4] I think I made that one up.

[5] No, not only faculty members from CS.

[6] I see from the [Pioneer One-Card Confidentiality Policy](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/PCard/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b955C9D0B-5DC9-49B7-8C5A-07668963A4CE%7d&file=Campus%20Card%20Confidentiality%20Policy-4.doc&action=default) that the policy was put into place in Fall 2001 and then changed in October 2016.  

[7] Early fall 2016, to be precise.

[8] Or at least the natural thing for me.

[9] For example, Student Affairs should not be able to change the
Academic Policies and Procedures.  Those should be under the purview of
the faculty.

[10] Well, that's not quite true.  I'm still not sure how to interpret the
"or when authorized" part of the new policy.

[11] <https://grinco.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/PCard/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b955C9D0B-5DC9-49B7-8C5A-07668963A4CE%7d&file=Campus%20Card%20Confidentiality%20Policy-4.doc&action=default>

[12] I'll still write things about them, just not today.

[14] That's news to me.  In the past, they've certainly weighed in on
appropriate and inappropriate uses of P-Card numbers, which strikes me
as an oversight issue.

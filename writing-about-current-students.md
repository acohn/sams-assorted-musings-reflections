Writing about current students
==============================

*A commentary written in association with an ongoing series about the
wonderous and wonderful people associated with our small college in
the middle of the corn and soyfields.*

In this series, I've written about alumni I know, about alumni I don't
know, about groups of students, current faculty, about former faculty,
about emeritus faculty, about current staff, about former staff,
and even about administrators.  But I haven't posted anything about
individual students [^1], even though I had planned to.

Now, there are certainly potential FERPA [^2] issues with posting essays
about students [^3].  However, I rarely post essays about people with
their permission, so that seems to meet the spirit and the law of FERPA.
But I've realized that I still shouldn't post essays.  Let's explore
why.

Last week, I wrote an essay about one of my current students, a student
who brings joy to my work and who makes our department better.  I was
getting ready to send it to them for approval, and then I thought a bit
more.  There's a power dynamic involved; it's probably hard for a student
to say no to a faculty member.  So then I thought about telling the
student to ask their parents whether it was okay.  That made me realize
that, as a parent, I'd feel a bit strange if a faculty member wrote as
much about a student as I've typically written about my subjects.
That's not to say that I shouldn't write so much about people.  Rather,
it's that it feels different when it's about a student than about an alum
or colleaguea  It's also not to say that I don't regularly write so much
about students; after all, what's a recommendation letter than a long
essay about a student?  But, once again, context matters.  Writing for
a recommendation letter is different than writing for a public site in
many ways.  Students request recommendations and I write in response.
In contrast, I write the essays and then request student permission.
Recommendations are private; these essays are public.

There's also the issue of apparent favoritism.  If I write about certain
students, will it make other students feel as if I care less about them?
I can see students asking why I wrote about particular other students.
And, given that Grinnell brings in more than four-hundred new students
each year, there's no way that I could keep up, even if I wrote about
a different student each day [^5].

In the end, this means that you will not see essays about any individual
students, at least while they are students.  But once they graduate, I'll
consider them fair game [^6].

[^1]: I was going to write "I haven't written anything about current
students", but that isn't true.  I have.  I just haven't posted it.
And I' won't.

[^2]: Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act, a law that governs
disclosure of student data.

[^3]: And alumni [^4], now that I think about it,

[^4]: Or at least alumni who should not be considered "public figures".

[^5]: Okay, there are only about 120 students who take CSC 151 each
year, so it is possible.  Nonetheless, it doesn't sound like a good time.

[^6]: With their permission, of course.

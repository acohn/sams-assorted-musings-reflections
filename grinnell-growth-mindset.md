Developing a growth mindset at Grinnell
=======================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), growth mindset, marketing*

I've recently been reading Carol Dweck's _Mindset_.  For those not
familiar with the Mindset work, Dweck identified a spectra of mindsets.
I'll do my best to summarize.  My summary is not guaranteed to be
accurate; you should read the original for more details.

At one end is "Fixed Mindset" and at the other end is "Growth Mindset".
Folks with fixed mindsets believe that their capabilities are, well,
fixed.  These folks are more inclined to look to external validations of
their capabilities, such as standardized tests, and may be less willing
to try a problem that challenges them.  Dweck also suggests that because
they look to external validations, they may be more inclined to lie
(to themselves and others) about things like test scores.  In contrast,
those with growth mindsets believe that they can get better at things
and, because they believe that, are more willing to accept challenges
("this is hard, but I can learn from it"), to admit problems ("I got
a low score on this exam; that means I need to do something different
next time), and to rely more on internal factors ("I can do it").
Dweck notes that people don't necessarily fall at the extremes of the
spectra and may end up at different locations depending on the context
(e.g., folks may have more of a growth mindset about their intellect
and more of a fixed mindset about their social skills).

In one of the chapters, Dweck discusses growth mindset and organizations.
It's been a bit since I've read the chapter, but I recall that part of
the issue is how organizations support the growth mindset in individuals
and part is how the organization itself reacts to challenges; is there a
belief that the organization itself can grow?

Grinnell's CS department seems to have a growth mindset.  We're never
satisfied with our curriculum and regularly ask ourselves what we might
change.  We regularly revisit long-standing choices, such as the language
in the first course [1].  We look for new ways to teach our courses
and new components to add [2].

But what about the institution?  It strikes me that Grinnell, as a whole,
is a bit less willing to embrace change.  Faculty can be very conservative.
Personally, I know that I questioned a variety of initiatives on campus,
from the Wilson Center ("Why are we talking about business at a liberal
arts college"), to

[1] We're sticking with Scheme, at least for the time being.  Other
schools may like Python, but most of us really do think that "functional
first" is a successful approach.  It provide a more level playing field,
helps students think more broadly about approaches to problem solving, and
makes it easier to think carefully about preconditions and postconditions.
We have considered other functional languages, such as Haskell.  In the
end, Scheme seems better for novices.

[2] Once in a while, we find things to drop.

Grinnellians you should know (or know about): W. Blake Creasey
==============================================================

*Part of an ongoing series about the folks that inhabit or have inhabited
our campus.*

In [a recent essay](writing-about-current-students.html), I noted that I
would not write essays about individual current students [1].  But that
doesn't mean that I won't write essays about recent alums.  So let's
consider W. Blake Creasey '16.  How do I describe Blake?  Maybe I'll
start with something Blake said at the recent panel on CSC 321/22 [2].
Janet asked the panelists what they'd learned from working on the CSC 322
projects.  Blake's response was "I've been thinking carefully about that."
He then followed up with "After all, I had to write an essay about that
at the end of each semester [3]."  Everyone laughed.  But I laughed for
a different reason than everyone else.  I laughed because "I've been
thinking carefully about that" summarizes my experience with Blake.
Whenever I talk to Blake about something (or whenever he writes to
me about something), I find that he's thought carefully about that.
Blake reflects carefully on his classes, on his travels, on people he
grew up with, on himself, on what he learns, and more.  As a teacher,
it's wonderful [4] to have a student like that.

Blake came to CS relatively late.  I think he took CSC 151 [5] in his
third semester at Grinnell.  And he discovered he liked it (or at least
I think he did).  But Blake was ambitious: He wanted to be able to study
abroad in Budapest in his fifth semester at Grinnell, and knew that he
needed to have completed our three-course introductory sequence by then.
So he took CSC 161 [6] in the spring, and found a summer equivalent to
CSC 207 [7].  I had enjoyed having Blake as a student until that point,
but in his summer course he really started showing me how carefully he
paid attention to things.  Over the course of the summer, he wrote me a
sequence of emails to explain what he found was different in the teaching
model of that course and ours, one of which was that we provided more
feedback [8].

And then Blake went to Budapest for the AIT program.  And, as had become
his wont, Blake sent me a few emails to let me know how his courses were
going.  Blake's opinions of CS seemed to change over that time; he was
less interested in the thrill of programming and more in the impact that
computing could have.    His letters were generous in many ways. He wrote
about many different things: his classes, his travels, and even what 
his peers were doing.  

In his last three semesters at Grinnell, Blake continued his CS major
(thankfully) and thought much more carefully about what he wanted to do.
One of the highlights of that time for me was Blake's presentation on
his summer internship working with Watson technology.  Blake, better
than most students I know, thought carefully about a wide variety of
technological implications, focusing not just on the technology, but
how it could be used and abused.

I started this essay with CSC 322; it seems reasonable to end it with
the same course.  This past year, I saw a lot of Blake in CSC 322.
Blake's team in the fall was excellent.  He had Zoe, Zhi, David, and
Albert; four of my favorite seniors [9].  They had the opportunity
to start a new project, and managed to almost complete the project
in one semester.  In contrast, most of our projects have taken four
semesters.  They also managed to convince folks that the project could
be used beyond our community.  Blake was passionate enough about the
project that he returned for a second semester.  His goal was to get
it ready for release, and he and the second team came close,  But they
got to experience the wonder of working with an external IT department.
I appreciate Blake's thoroughness in trying to push through that; I wish
he'd been more successful [10].  But I think he learned a lot.  No, I
know he learned a lot, because he spoke well about it at reunion.

Blake's now gone on to consulting.  I expect his intelligence and his
thoughtful approach to thinks will make him an excellent consultant.
I've left out a lot about the various conversations we've had, and we've
had a lot of them.  But I think this essay covers the high points.  I'm
sure I'll get a thoughtful reply.  I'll miss the in-person conversations,
but I look forward to the occasional email with his careful reflections.
And I can't wait to hear his reflections in five years when he returns for
the next CS reunion.

[1] Or should that be current individual students?

[2] CSC 321 is Software Design Principles and Practices.  CSC 322 is
Team-Based Software Development for Community Organizations.  

[3] Blake took CSC 322 twice so that he could finish his project.

[4] And, I will admit, a bit challenging.

[5] Functional problem solving, our first course, which emphasizes
the basics of computational thinking, using Scheme.  We cover recursion,
higher-order procedures, and more.

[6] Imperative problem solving, our second course, which emphasizes
memory management and related issues, using C to force students to
think more "under the hood".

[7] Object-oriented problem solving, our third course, which is a
traditional Data Structures and Algorithms course with some OOP
sprinkled in.

[8] Stop laughing.  While I don't grade a lot, when I do grade, I provide
feedback beyond "it works" and "it doesn't work".  I provide information
on style, on algorithm design, and more.  I'm pretty sure that everyone
in the department does.

[9] Okay, the class of 2016 was an awesome class.  Almost all of them
fall among my favorite seniors.

[10] The class mentors and I have decided that we should probably try
hosting on a PaaS [11] instead of relying on our partners' IT infrastructures.
One partner thinks that's a great idea.  I'm planning a meeting with our
other partner over winter break to try to convince them of the benefits
of having us host.  And I'm trying to get the College to fund it all.

[11] Platform as a Service, like Heroku.

[12] Or ten years, depending on what DAR permits.

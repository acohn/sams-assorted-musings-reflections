Noyce Third
===========

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), rambly*

_Daily readers may note that in [yesterday's musing](profile-2018-06-10),
I noted that the CS Commons was one of my favorite places on campus.
Today, my muse suggested that I muse about [the CS Commons](cs-commons).
However, she didn't suggest it because of yesterday's musing.  It
seems that I added a placeholder for the CS commons to my list of
prospective musings on 15 October 2016.  In helping me select today's
topic, my muse suggested that I look through the list of prospective
musings from the bottom (oldest) rather than the top (newest) and
this one struck her fancy.  So, although it would have been a kind of 
followup, it was also a long-delayed musing.  However, it's going to
be delayed yet another day.  Once I sat down to write about the
Commons, my muse insisted that I first give some background on Noyce
third.  Once I passed five-hundred words of background, most of
which were in the endnotes, we agreed that I was better off focusing
on Noyce third, rather than the CS Commons.  Maybe I'll write about
the CS Commons tomorrow._

About fifteen years ago, I served as the CS representative [1] for
the planning and design of Phase II of the Noyce Science Center
reconstruction [2,3].  In many ways, CS was very fortunate.  The
College had originally planned only one phase for the Noyce
reconstruction.  However, the need to fund-raise for the Bucksbuam
reconstruction [4] meant that the College decided to break Noyce
into two phases.  If they'd only done one, they would not have
considered CS; Phase II planning happened at our previous high
point.

We didn't do everything right in the Phase II planning for CS and
we also had a lot of our plans changed [5].  But we got many important
things: research labs for faculty, a bit of room for additionalf
aculty and staff [7], study spaces [8], storage spaces [9], a server
room and a printer room [10], an open laboratory [11], a CS Commons
for students to work and for faculty and students to socialize,
museum space [12], and more.  It's also clear that we designed the
classrooms relatively well; not only do the classrooms support our 
style of teaching, which continues to emphasize active learning, they
also seem to be a place in which students like to work in the evening.

While people, rather than spaces, are the heart of the department,
I think we've done a good job of building spaces that support the
people.  I hear from our students that we continue to have a strong
community in the department.  Our faculty and students help build
that community, but I also hear that the spaces work well to support
that community.  There are places to go when you want to be social.
There are places to go when you mostly want to work quietly.  There
are places in which you can work and ask others for help, both
informal and formal.

That's not to say that it's perfect.  I think we've learned a lot
in the decade-plus on Noyce third.  If I were to redesign Noyce
third and had more resources, there are certainly many things I'd
change.  Our new faculty members have very different perspectives
on what a research lab should look like; that's a relatively easy
change.  We need more spaces for students to work on small group
projects.  That's a hard change; it requires more space.  We had
four faculty members when we planned Noyce 3rd.  We now have six
faculty members and one staff members [14] and are about to add our
seventh faculty member.  We need more labs and offices.  That's
also a very hard change.  ITS and FM did not plan the networking
drops well.  I'm told that's a hard change.  We built multi-stall
bathrooms.  We should have single-stall bathrooms so that the city
will allow us to make them inclusive.  I'm not how hard that change
is; I'm hopeful that that's one change the College will find a way
to make.  And then there are the host of small things: the furnishings
and technology, the color of the rooms and hallway, the number of
benches, and so on and so forth.

Fortunately, I won't be around when they design the next CS space.
And, as fortunately, our current space is still really nice, even
if it's a bit more cramped than it used to be.

[1] I was going to say "CS Department Representative".  However, we were
not yet a department.

[2] I'm not sure that it was officially the Noyce Science Center at the
time that Phase I planning started.  The Noyce donation may have led to
the naming.  It was most likely still the Bowen Hall of Science.

[3] When I say "Noyce Reconstruction", I mean the latest in a series
of reconstructions and extensions of the Science Building.  I'm not sure
how many there have been, but it's a lot.  There's a wing built in the 
1980's that houses Psychology and Math/Stats.  There's a wing that was
built in the 1950's that got torn down for Phase II.  And there are
at least one or two other parts that I know got added before Phase I.

[4] This was back in the time when Trustees believed that you should
raise funds before you commit to building something new.

[5] I'm unlikely to remember everything, but I can recall a few
changes or problems.  Let's see ... (a) After teaching in a lab
that had no window, we insisted on windows in our labs.  They put
a frosted window in our primary teaching lab.  It turns out that
that's because they put giant air handlers outside the window.  But
it's still better to have a clear window.  (b) After watching the
College buy particle board shelving for Math offices and then having
to retrofit them once they collapsed under the weight of a typical
faculty library, we specified wooden shelving.  They gave us particle
board and promised us it was just as good.  When Henry Walker's
shelves fell off the wall, they admitted that the new particle board
shelves would also need reinforcement.  (c) There was supposed to
be a second elevator to the third floor.  That got cut in cost-cutting.
(d) There were supposed to be more display cases for the CS museum.
Those also got cut.  Our classrooms were supposed to have vertically
sliding whiteboards.  It turned out that city regulations required
us to cut about ten feet off of the height of Noyce, so we got
horizontally sliding whiteboards.  (e) Our study areas were supposed
to be open to the corridor.  The interpretation of fire codes at
the time suggested that we needed fire doors.  That makes some
sense; the study areas look out on the library.  But I've heard
that the laws have changed.  (f) They didn't put hold-opens on the
classrooms or research labs.  Fortunately, we have not been fined
for people propping the classrooms open.  (g) We had planned a glass
wall between the CS commons and the corridor to allow light into
the corridor.  That also got cut for fire laws.  (h) In early plans,
the CS commons was much bigger and was being considered as both the
CS commons and a general reception area for the Science building.
(i) Our designers didn't consider it necessary to include light
switches in the CS commons and FM didn't tell us [6]. (j) Instead
of the wood-colored shelving we expected, we got an institutional
dark grey. (k) We did not get the window treatments that the first
designer described to us, treatments that are similar to those in
the JRC.  (l) They installed shelving in the bathroom that was too
narrow to hold a notebook.  I complained about that enough that
they eventually fixed it.

Okay, perhaps I remember more than I thought.  Amazingly, there are a
bunch of other issues related to Noyce third that are somewhere in my
head and that I haven't yet listed.

[6] Perhaps the CS faculty could have noticed that there were not light
switches.  But we are not trained in reading blueprints.  And, well, it's
a reasonable assumption that rooms have light switches.  I've repeatedly
been told that it's much too expensive to retrofit light switches.

of issues related to the CS commons; I'll address those in the main
body of the musing.  (h) And yes, there are others.

[7] We planned for some expansion.  With our newest postion, we
have exceeded that planning.  Figuring out how we'll handle another
faculty member will be an interesting challenge.  I have indicated
that I am willing to move elsewhere in Noyce so that we have room
for the new faculty member.  I'm pretty sure at least one other senior
colleague would do the same.

[8] We had two.  We've converted one to a faculty lab.  We will maintain
the other as a study space.  But we may end up adding display cabinets
for the CS museum, which has grown in leaps and bounds.

[9] We had to convert one of the storage spaces to an office for our
learning coordinator.  If I recally correctly, that's because we had
originally planned for a space for the CS learning coordinator next to
the CS learning center and that got kiboshed as things were being cut
from the building.

[10] When we converted our storage space to an office for our
learning coordinator, the printer room became a storage space.  It's
smaller than the original storage space, which meant that we had
to get rid of some stuff and that I could no longer use that space
as my own spare storage.

[11] Unfortunately, as the number of classes has increased, we've had
to start teaching in the open lab.

[12] Or at least display cabinets.

[14] Plus a Linux SysAdmin who is no longer housed on Noyce 3rd.

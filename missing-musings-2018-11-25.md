More musings I'll fail to finish
================================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta), rambly*

Early this month, I [restarted my "sketchbook" of forthcoming
musing](new-sketchbook-2018-11-05).  In doing so, I not only pruned any
musing that was not yet categorized, I also eliminated some musings
that I realized it would no longer make sense to write about or that
I realized were low enough of a priority that I'd probably never get
to writing a full musing about them.  But I hate to throw things
away [1], so I thought I would at least commemorate some of those topics
by writing a paragraph or so about them.  Might give readers a broader
sense of the kinds of things I sometimes think about.

*Beloit College.*
A few months ago, [Beloit College announced some significant budget cuts](http://www.beloitdailynews.com/news/20180824/beloit_college_grappling_with_financial_issues).  I was surprised not to see broader coverage in the higher-education press.  There was [a short mention in _Chronicle_](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Daily-Briefing/238091).  But these seem like big and scary changes.  Why wasn't there broader coverage, particularly given that Beloit was [dropping
their famous "mindset list"](http://www.rrstar.com/news/20180826/georgette-braun-beloit-college-drops-mindset-list)?

Since it's been three months, it seems a bit late.  If I'd written
something more, I'd probably write about the broader issue of enrollments
at peer institutions, or at least Midwest liberal arts colleges.  Beloit
is clearly having trouble.  A few days ago, there was an announcement
about significant issues at DePauw.  Simpson has been cutting faculty
and even whole departments.  I've even heard rumors about enrollment
issues at Luther and Oberlin.  It's really scary.

*Beloit's mindset list.*
When I added Beloit to my list, I also added the
mindset list.  I see that [it's now been taken over by
Marist](http://themindsetlist.com/2018/10/its-the-marist-college-mindset-list-now/).
When I added the topic, I thought I'd speak to the general value of the
list, and perhaps even suggest that Grinnell adopt it.  It seems pointless
to write more.

*Developing a work strategy.*
Here are the notes I had:

> One of my fellow Fellows at the Obermann center asked the rest of us
about the approaches we take to ensure that we make progress on our
work.  That seems like a good incentive for me to sit down and figure
things out.  I've been blogging daily [mostly] for the past two years
as a I way to get myself used to writing regularly and to think through
some broader topics of interest.  I use a task list manager and try
to put relatively small tasks on that list.  [Okay, I've used a wide
variety of task list managers.  For awhile, I used Trello boards.  These
days, I find that Todoist does the best job for me.]  Have enough of a
variety of tasks so that if I get stuck on one, I can switch to another.

But my time at Obermann is wrapping up and it's clear that my work
strategy was not a success.

*Saints Rest.*
Saw it and planned to muse about it.  But it's been about two months now.
It seemed interesting to consider a movie that is set in my home town
and is, in some sense, an homage to Grinnell the town and Grinnell
the College.  It was great to see Jon Richardson.  There were some parts
that felt wrong, such as people walking on Main street as they go home
to a house on Broad street from Saints Rest.  And that's it for my notes.

*PCard Privacy.*
Okay, this is one I actually wrote.  I'm really frustrated by the lack
of clear policies on the use of building entrance data.  I'm frustrated
enough that I wrote a 2000-word musing.  But I decided not to post the
musing [2], so I'm eliminating it from the list.

*Paper Rebel.*
Paper Rebel is a new line of greeting cards from American Greetings.
I Loved the name. I considered writing something when they released them
to the public.  But I didn't.  It seems less relevant now.

*Fun things that I can't attend: [The Leonardo Convening](https://www.leonardo.info/convening).*
When I saw the announcement, I thought to myself "This is cool.  I'm on
leave. I  should have time to attend."  But I didn't.  And don't.
I missed a lot of conferences I wanted to attend this fall.  ICFP [3]
was in driving distance.  So was SHOT [4].  There were enough conferences
that I wanted to attend and couldn't that I thought about making it a
series.

*The Google Thing*.  This musing was to about what happens when something
sits in the sketchbook for too long.  Here are my notes from 17 July 2018.

> I [recently wrote about some musings that I would never
write](missing-musings-2018-07-08).  Along the way, I noted that I had
a note that said "Application for Google thingy?" and I had no memory of
what it meant.  But I use Git to store my musings, so I could go back and
look when I'd added the line.  I added it on October 15, 2016, along with
a bunch of other musings.  So it kind of makes sense that I've forgotten.
I forget things I was planning a month ago, let alone nearly two years
ago.  I could look back at my email from then for a clue.  I can think
of two options: I'd been on a Google education advisory committee, and
I was considering whether to volunteer for more work.  I also regularly
think about asking Google for support for our local code club.

That's it for the notes.  It probably would have made a good short musing
on one of those days that I needed to muse quickly.  But I have enough
of those.  I also appreciate that it's evidence that I do need to cull
the musings once in a while.

*Requirements for our Web site (a note for the Web governance committee)*.
Here's one that I seem to have added to the list,
[written](grinnell-web-governance-notes), and then forgotten to remove.
However, I see that I had drafted an introduction earlier and forgotten
about that, too.  Here's that introduction, which I wrote on 3 July 2018.

> As you may recall, I spend way too much of my time frustrated by the
damage that Communications did to our Web site about five years ago.
(add story) This year, the College finally re-formed the Web governance
committee.  Of course, they didn't meet much and when they did meet,
they scheduled meetings at times that the Faculty reps couldn't make.
But they are still trying to make progress.  Recently, someone asked
me what I'd like to see in terms of campus Web resources.  This musing
represents my attempt to think through that question in more depth.

That reminds me:  There was a followup discussion about the MathLAN Web
servers which I should muse about.

*Grammarly vs. MS Word*.
I have no memory of what this one was supposed to be about.  I assume
it's about my experience of trying to open and edit Word documents in
Grammarly.  Given that I can't remember, I can delete the topic.

*Syntactic sugar*.
Another vague memory.  I recall encountering a situation in which I
was talking about the value of syntactic sugar.  Or maybe it was that I
was upset about the amount of syntactic sugar necessary for something.
Or perhaps I wanted to explain the term.  In any case, it no longer
seems to be a priority.

*The five types of professors*.
Every few days, I find an article (often in _Chronicle_ or _Inside Higher Ed_,
but also elsewhere) that makes me want to write about the subject matter.
This one is available at
<https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-5-Types-of-Professors-/243108>
Enough time has passed that I don't think I'll ever end up writing about
this particular article.

*We've been Ologized*.
If I recall correctly, I added this topic to my list after a particularly
positive session with the folks from Ologie, our marketing firm.  However,
it's clear that I was also a bit suspicious of marketing, since I'd also
added the supposedly humorous note "Let's hope that we're not eulogized".
At this point, it's not worth a full musing.

---

I cut more than those listed above.  Some that I've cut may become
relevant again, but need to wait until I feel inspired.  For example,
I had a series entitled "Things I should write for 282 [5]".  I won't
be teaching that course for awhile, so I'd rather wait until it's a
high priority.  I also cut notes on the inbox zero project since that's
on hiatus [6].  I'm comfortable knowing that, if I need to recall any
of the topics I cut, all of them live on in the old notebook [7].

---

Postscript: When I started this musing almost a month ago [8], I came
up with a variety of alliterations to use in the title.  Here are the
ones I recorded:  "never notate", "can't complete", "shan't scribe",
"won't write", and "fail to finish".  I settled on the last.  I also
thought about describing it from your perspective, but I couldn't come
up with a good alliteration for "you'll never read".

---

[1] Anyone who has seen my office, lab, home, or computer knows that.

[2] It's in the repo.

[3] International Conference on Functional Programming.

[4] Society for the History of Technology.

[5] 282 is "[Thinking in C and Unix](index-cnix)" or, as I refer to it
at times, "Don't Embarrass Me; Don't Embarrass Yourself".

[6] There was a period I was regularly keeping track of how badly I
was doing at the project.  I've stopped that now.  Time was supposed
to be more available during my leave but I feel like I have too little,
particularly as I near the end.

[7] I did say that I never throw anything away.

[8] Yup, enough time passed that this was almost a missing musing.

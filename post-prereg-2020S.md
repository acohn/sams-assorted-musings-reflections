A few weeks ago, I wrote my semesterly [1] musing on preregistration,
this one on [preregistration for spring 2020](prereg-2020S).  I
realize that I'm supposed to call it "open registration" rather
than "preregistration" [2].  But [the list of faculty dates to
remember](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Lists/FacDates/Deadlines.aspx)
[3] still calls it "preregistration", as does [the list of student dates
to remember](https://www.grinnell.edu/about-grinnell/leadership-and-administration/offices-and-services/registrar/calendars/student-dates?v2node) [4].
So I'm going to stick with "preregistration", at least for the time being.

I find it interesting to compare the state of our registration between
the end of preregistration and after cuts, closes, and balances have
happened.  This year, I've waited until the end of the semester, which 
should have allowed things to settle down [5].

What are some of the interesting changes I've observed?  Let's address the
departments in alphabetical order.

As expected, ALS [6] has gone from an over-enrolled 0-credit course
with eighteen students to six different courses (Italian I, Hindi
I, Brazilian Portuguese I, Hungarian I, Korean II, and Korean III),
each with about two students.  It's still an over-enrolled course
with twenty-one students.

Katya and Leslie's AMS/ANT/BIO-220, _Racing Through Genetics_, has gone from
24 students to 22, but remains over-enrolled.  I assume they couldn't
bear to cut more than two students, or perhaps two students volunteered
to switch to another course.

The four sections of ANT-104, _Anthropological Inquiries_, which were
over-enrolled by about one section's worth of students, are now five
sections of ANT-104.  It's nice of Tess Kulstad to pick up another
section.  I hope we're compensating Tess appropriately.

Kathy Kamp and Lesley Wright cut about fourteen people from
ANT/HUM-205, _Desiging Museum Displays_ [7].

The two over-enrolled sections of ART-111, _Introduction to the
Studio_, have become three sections of ART-111.  One person is
teaching all three sections, and the sections are all Tuesday/Thursday.
I do not envy them [8] those days.  I guess that's a positive side
effect of the change in in-class time for the studio classes [9].
In contrast, there is not a new section of _Drawing_.  But Jeremy Chen
is already teaching three courses in the spring.  Four would be awful.
It looks like Jeremy couldn't bear to kick people out of ART-240,
_Ceramics_, so that course is still slightly over-enrolled.

ASC-101, _Scholars Seminar_, is still being offered, even though it
has only two students.  But it's a one-credit course, and many students
end up adding it after they see how they do in their first semester at
Grinnell.

Somehow, nine students got cut from BCM-262-01, _Intro Biological
Chem w/lab_, but there are still slots open in BCM-262-02.  I don't
know what's up with that.  Perhaps they are allowing the students
who got cut to petition to get into the other section.  I know that
there are years in which they've allowed that course to significantly
over-enroll, but that's not healthy for faculty.

Speaking of leaving courses over-enrolled, it appears Clark has kept
24 students in BIO 263, _Neurobiology_, even though it's officially
capped at 18.  The labs are also over-enrolled, presumably at the number
of students who can safely work in the lab space.

Elsewhere in Biology, BIO-252, _Organisms, Evolution, and Ecology
with Lab_, appears to have managed to balance its sections and even
add a few more people.  CHM-129, _General Chemistry w/Lab_, also seems
to have balanced its sections.  The most-over-enrolled section is now
the only one that's not over-enrolled, but I think that's because it's
the workshop section.

Back to over-enrolled courses, it looks like each section of CHM-222,
_Organic Chemistry II_, is over-enrolled by seven students.  You'd
think that they'd add another section rather than add that many
students to each class.  But perhaps they couldn't find someone to
staff another section, perhaps they couldn't find a space to offer
it, or perhaps the Dean wouldn't come up with the money.  In any case,
Organic II is important enough that I expect they felt that they could
not cut anyone.  At least they have enough lab offerings!

Next up is my department, Computer Science.  We balanced the three
sections of CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving w/lab_ and were
still able to allow a few more students in.  I know that some
first-year students were frustrated that they got cut in the fall,
but we managed to meet all the demand in the spring.  Six sections
per year seem to suffice.

CSC-261, _Imperative Problem Solving w/lab_ was our hardest course
to handle.  We were over-enrolled by twenty students and could not
fit that many in the classroom.  Barbara Johnson graciously agreed
to switch from CSC-105 to open a third section.  And we were able
to find someone else interested in teaching CSC-105 [10].  I see
that most of our courses are at or near capacity, which seems to
be the norm these days.  I'm a bit surprised to see that both
sections of CSC-326 are left as open, given that we over-enrolled
CSC-324 with the understanding that it used the open slots in 324.
I've [written enough about other cut, close, and balance issues in
my department](ccb-2019-11-24) that I don't think there's much more
to add.

I'm surprised to see that Economics cut one section of ECN-111,
_Introduction to Economics_.  They usually fill as many sections as they
can offer.  Maybe students are heading over to Anthropology instead.
It looks like section 1 of ECN-286, _Econometrics_ is still over-filled
and there is room in section 2.  They seem to have tried to balance
them.  It seems strange that the 8:00 a.m. section is over-enrolled.
There's more room in ECN-329, _Advanced Econometrics_, and
ECN-338, _Applied Game Theory_, than I would expect.  Otherwise,
everything seems pretty much full.  I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the 30 students who they needed to cut from Brad
Graham's _Economics of Innovation_.

On to Education.  EDU-101, _Educational Principles in a Pluralistic
Society_ was over-enrolled during pre-registration.  It doesn't
look like they were able to find room for everyone.  Two classes
are cancelled, but they were cancelled before preregistration.
Nothing else seems particularly surprising.

English seems to have balanced the enrollments in ENG-120, _Literary
Analysis_.    Both sections of ENG-205, _The Craft of Fiction_, are
now full.  I think that means that they needed to cut 33 students.
There does seem to be significant demand for courses that explicitly
focus on creativity [11].  Dean B's [12] evening course in screenwriting
is also full.  I'm glad that there are still a few slots in Ralph's
morning class in Ralph's ENG-207, _Craft of Creative Nonfiction_.
That means he'll let me in.  I see that John Garrison has continued
his practice of allowing his 300-level classes to over-enroll.
There are eighteen in ENG-316, _Studies in English Renaissance
Literature_.  It sounds like his practice is carrying on to others,
too.  Markab La van, who I don't know, is allowing sixteen into
_ENG-229, _Studies in African American Literature_.

All of the Environmental studies courses are full.  I wonder who
is teaching ENG-295, the special topics course on _Climate Change
and Indigenous People_.  It seems very popular (and very interesting).

There's not a lot to report on in French.  It appears that FAN-103,
_Accelerated Introduction to French_, was cancelled.  I wonder what
happens to the students who had enrolled in the course; it's easy to 
lose a language if you take too much time off.  I'm glad to see that
French is doing well at the 300-level; they clearly need both sections
of FRN-305, _Contemporary Francophone Culture_.

Switching to a somewhat older language, I'm thrilled to see that
GRE-222, _Intermediate Greek_, is completely full.  Grinnell students
seem to be showing an appropriate level of interest in Classics.

I'm happy to see that the German Lab that was scheduled on Thursdays
at 11:00 has now moved to Thursdays at 1:00.  Nothing should be
scheduled at the same time as Scholars' Convocation.  I wonder if
the original was just a typo.

At the end of preregistration, section 1 of GWS-111, _Introduction to
Gender, Women's, & Sexuality Studies_ [14] was over-enrolled by twenty-five
students and section 2 had three slots.  Now section 1 is exactly
full and section 2 is over-enrolled by one student.  I don't
understand these things.  Tamara Beauboeuf's special topic on
_Educating Women_ is still over-enrolled by two.

_You know what?  I'm getting a bit sick of all of this.  Why am I
doing it again?  Oh, that's right.  More knowledge helps.  It helps
me advise.  It may help others plan.  Okay, I'm going to press on.
I'll probably focus mostly on courses that were over-enrolled at
the preregistration._

What's next?  History.  HIS-210, _Historical Perspectives on US
Education_ [15] was over-enrolled by three students.  Now it's
over-enrolled by two.  HIS-277, _China's Rise_, was over-enrolled
by ten students (thirty-five enrolled with a cap of twenty-five).
Now it's over-enrolled by only two.  I wonder what happened to the
other eight students.  That's a serious comment; I'm still not sure
how the department decided who to cut or to move.  HIS-330, _Pol
of Food/Early-Mod England_, was over-enrolled by seven.  Students
do seem to like courses targeted at food.  Now it's right at capacity.
It looks like those students shifted to other 300-level seminars.

On a side note [16], I'm interested by the choice to include "of" in the
abbreviated title.  We are capped at thirty characters, probably because
of an old-style database, or a need to fit the title in some printed
documents.  Abbreviating titles is an interesting activity.  I've already
noted that CS is inconsistent in how it abbreviates "Problem Solving".
I would have used "Pol Food" rather than "Pol of Food" but what do I
know?  I am a bit amused at "Early-Mod" since that could refer to the
early 1960s and the start of the Mod movement in England.  With that
choice, one could, for example, compare Mod food to Rocker food and consider
the political implications thereof.  I suppose you'd watch _Quadrophenia_
to get a better understanding of the time [17].

HUM-195, _ST: Soc Impact Documentary Film_, had fifty students enrolled
for twenty slots.  It's good to see courses by CS alums getting strong
enrollment [19].

LIN-395, _ST: Language and Humor_, had eighteen students enrolled
for fifteen slots.  I'm surprised that that many students had the
qualifications for a 300-level course in linguistics.  I wonder
what the prereqs are.  I see that they read "ANT-280, or any 200-level
course that counts towards Linguistics concentration".  I also see that
it's cross-listed as ANT-395 [20].  I don't think it's worth my
effort to see what 200-level courses count toward the Linguistics
concentration, but I do wonder why they dropped the article in the
prerequisite description.  In any case, it appears that they cut
three students from that course.

On to Mathematics and Statistics, or maybe just Mathematics, since
Statistics now has its own designation.  Let's see.  MAT-131-01,
_Calculus I_, remains over-enrolled by two students  It's hard to
tell students that they can't take Calculus. At the end of
preregistration, we had three sections of MAT-133, _Calculus II_.
Section 1 had two slots available.  Section 2 was over-enrolled by
two students.  Section 3 had sixteen open slots.  After CCB, we
have two slots available in section 1, no slots in section 2, and
eleven slots in section 3.  All three are marked as "balanced".  In
CS, we would have been more aggressive about balancing; that is,
we would have tried to get about 28 students in each section, rather
than the current 30/32/21.  Equal-sized sections provide a more
consistent experience for the students.  But it's not always possible
to balance sections.

While we're on the subject of MAT-133, I see that we've switched section 1
from Chris French to "Staff".  I wonder what Chris picked up instead.  Ah!
I see.  He's now teaching a section of MAT-218, _Graph Theory_.  That frees
Karen Shuman to teach a section of MAT-316, _Foundations of Analysis_, which
was over-enrolled by fifteen-students.  It's hard to teach over-enrolled
sections of 300-level courses in Mathematics because they are writing-intensive
courses.  More precisely, they are proof-writing-intensive courses.

Returning to the sections of Math courses, let's consider MAT-215,
_Linear Algebra_.  Section 1 had some open slots.  But who wants to
do math at 8:00 a.m. [21]?  Section 2 was over-enrolled by one student
and section 3 was over-enrolled by nineteen students.  After CCB,
no section is over-enrolled.  However, there are more slots available
in the 8:00 a.m. section.  As I said before, CS would likely have moved
more students into that section.

Up next is MAT-218, _Combinatorics & Number Theory_.  That was 
over-enrolled by eleven students.  And like MAT-316, it's a course
with a lot of proof writing.  The addition of MAT-218, _Graph Theory_,
picks up that slack.  

You may be wondering why MAT-218 has multiple titles.  Officially,
MAT-218 is something like "Discrete Bridges to Advanced Mathematics".
It's a course in which students fully transition from a formula-driven
view of mathematics that some have from Calculus to one grounded
more in proof and formal systems.  Of course, they also make some
of that transition in earlier courses, including Calculus, but
primarily in Linear Algebra.  In any case, a few years ago, the
Department of Mathematics and Statistics decided to make it a
somewhat open-topic course; faculty teaching it could choose what
formal system to base the proof-writing and learning in.  I believe
that there are at least three versions: graph theory, number theory,
and geometry.  The number theory version also adds combinatorics,
at least in some sections.  MAT-218 also serves to meet one of the
math requirements for CS.

Up next is MAT-316, _Foundations of Analysis_, which I've mentioned
already.  It had been over-enrolled by fifteen students.  With Karen
Shuman teaching a second section, there are now twenty students in
one section and seventeen in the other.  I guess the additional
time made it possible for more students to take the course.

MAT-321, _Foundations of Abstract Algebra_, was over-enrolled by
nine students.  It's now over-enrolled by three.  I worry a bit
about that over-enrollment, since it's an intensive proof-writing
course, and that requires a lot of feedback from the faculty member.
But there generally aren't other options when required 300-level
courses over-enroll [22].  I expect a few students switched to MAT-316.

MAT-322, _Algebraic Graph Theory_, had nineteen students enrolled and
a cap of twelve.  Now it has "only" sixteen students enrolled [24].  From
one perspective, that doesn't seem so bad.  However, I know from personal
experience that it's a burden to teach all of your classes at or over 
capacity, even when some are officially "smaller" classes.  And we do choose
caps for good reasons.

MAT-395, _ST: Applied Data Science_, was over-enrolled by two students.  It's
now at capacity.  Part of me says "Couldn't you keep those two students in
the course?"  But another part of me reminds that first part that
we have course caps for a reason.  Speaking of MAT-395: I'm not
sure why it's not listed as STA-395.  Oh, wait.  It is.  Cross-listing
between Mathematics and Statistics is new to me.

And that's it for Mathematics.  We'll look at the rest of Statistics
separately.  It feels like I had to write more about Mathematics than
I did about almost any other department.  I hope the Dean's office and
other administrators realize what a burden it is to have to deal with
that much shifting.  Not only do  you have to figure out what kinds of
shifts are appropriate, and, as in this instance, shift around faculty
and create and remove sections, you also have to deal with the pushback
from students who are shifted.

Given how over-enrolled Math is at the 300 level and elsewhere, it
seems like it's time for them to get another regular faculty member.
I wonder when the last time Math grew was.  When I started in the
Fall of 1997, we had about seven mathematicians [25,28].  As best
I can tell, we still have seven [29].  Grinnell has grown a lot in
the past twenty-some-odd years.  And the Sciences have grown even
more, at least as a percentage of majors [30].  I'd hope that's a
good argument.  And I hope that the Trustees would allow us to add
someone in Mathematics without sacrificing a tenure-line position
elsewhere.  I realize that we've added folks in Statistics in the
past decade [31].  However, counting additions in Statistics against 
Mathematics is like counting additions in Arabic against French [33].

Wow.  I'm digressing a lot.  Back to the main musing.

Music is hard to analyze because there are so many kinds of music
courses.  Let's start with music lessons [34].  MUS-120-08,
_Perf: Percussion_, had twenty-four students enrolled with a cap
of twelve.  MUS-120-09, _Perf: Clarinet_, had five students enrolled
with a cap of four.  MUS-120-10, _Perf: Jazz Saxophone_, also had
five enrolled with a cap of four.  MUS-120-19, _Perf: Organ_, had
four enrolled with a cap of three.  MUS-120-38, _Perf: Cello_, had
sixteen students enrolled with a cap of fifteen.  MUS-120-40, _Perf:
Bassoon_, had six enrolled with a cap of three.  MUS-120-91, _Perf:
Guitar_ had thirty-one enrolled with a cap of twenty. MUS-120-92,
_Perf: Piano_ had fifty-five enrolled with a cap of twenty.
MUS-120-93, _Perf: Voice_, had sixty-seven enrolled with a cap
of twenty.  None of the MUS-220 or MUS-221 courses are over-enrolled.
That may not be surprising since each has a cap of twenty.  What's
the difference between the two?  MUS-220 meets for thirty minutes each
week and MUS-221 meets for sixty minutes each week [35].  MUS-320,
_Shared Recital_, and MUS-420, _Individual Recital_, do not appear in
the list of courses from preregistration.

Now, I'll admit that I don't quite get how caps in music lessons
work nor how we deal with over-enrollment.  I'm pretty sure that
the practica faculty get paid per set of lessons [36].  Where do
the caps come from?  Is that the number they expect to teach?  The
number they indicate that they would be able to teach?  And what
do we do when a set of lessons over-enrolls?  Do we find someone
else to teach?  Do we ask the faculty member to teach more?  Do we
turn students away?  The last seems inappropriate since we've
indicated that every student should be able to take a set of lessons
in their instrument of choice each semester and that Music majors
should be able to take as many sets of lessons as they would like.
I do see that the MUS-120-9x classes are all listed as "Staff",
which suggests that they plan to break them up among multiple
faculty.  That seems new; I recall that each of those instruments
listed individual instructors in the past.  It does look like
individual faculty *are* named at the 200 level.

So, what happened?

MUS-120-08, _Perf: Percussion_, now has twenty-three students enrolled
with a cap of twenty.  The cap has gone up significantly and one
student has disappeared.  I wonder if the College has to pay extra
benefits to someone who is teaching more than twenty lessons.
MUS-120-09, _Perf: Clarinet_ and MUS-120-10, _Perf: Jazz Saxophone_,
have stayed the same: Five students enrolled in each with a cap of
four.  MUS-120-19, _Perf: Organ_, also remained the same, with four
enrolled and a cap of three.  MUS-120-38, _Perf: Cello_, also
remained overenrolled by one with sixteen students enrolled and a
cap of fifteen.  MUS-120-40, _Perf: Bassoon_, is down to five
enrolled with a cap of three.  MUS-120-91, _Perf: Guitar_ is gone
from the list.  Twenty six are in the newly created MUS-120-11,
_Perf: Guitar_ and thirteen are in the newly created MUS-120-42,
_Perf: Guitar_.  That's up from the thirty-one who were there at
the end of pre-registration.  MUS-120-92, _Perf: Piano_, is also
gone.  In its place are MUS-120-14, _Perf: Piano_, with fifty-one
students [37], and MUS-120-20, with eleven students.  Since there
were fifty-five enrolled at the end of prereg, it looks like we've
gone up a bit in piano.  MUS-120-93 has been replaced with MUS-120-02,
_Perf: Voice_, with twenty-two students, MUS-120-13, _Perf: Voice_,
with eleven students, MUS-120-15, _Perf: Voice_, with eighteen
students, MUS-120-23, _Perf: Voice_, with no students [38], and
MUS-120-44, _Perf: Voice_, with nineteen students.  There were
sixty-seven students enrolled in 100-level voice; it appears that
there are now seventy enrolled in the sections I just mentioned.

From these data, I presume that (a) we do not normally cut students
from music classes and (b) the new MUS-120-9x courses exist to simplify
enrollment in popular types of lessons.  I would expect that for the
latter, it helps address the issue that some students are enrolling
for the first time and could presumably be associated with any instructor,
while others will likely want to repeat with a particular instructor.

As long as we're on the subject of music lessons, it seems worthwhile
to look at all of the kinds of lessons we offer.  In alphabetical
order, I see the following twenty-eight different instruments and
I may have missed one or two: Accordion, Bagpipes, Banjo, Baritone
Horn, Clarinet, Cornetto [39], Double Bass, Flute, French Horn,
Guitar, Harp, Harpsichord, Jazz Bass, Jazz Organ, Jazz Piano, Jazz
Saxophone, Jazz Voice, Oboe, Organ, Percussion, Piano, Saxophone,
Trombone, Trumpet, Tuba, Viola, Violin, and Voice.  That's a pretty
good variety.  I've also heard rumors that students (or at least music
majors) who have an interest in getting lessons in another instrument
can sometimes request them and the College will find an instructor.

How many students are enrolled in music lessons?  That's hard to
count since some enroll in multiple lessons.  So let's look at
enrollments.  I see about 329 in MUS-120 [40], forty-one (41) in
MUS-220, twenty (20) in MUS-221, seven (7) in MUS-320, and one (1)
in MUS-420.  So somewhere between one in five and one in four
Grinnell students is taking music lessons next semester.  We should
strive to increase that number.

On to other music courses, or at least over-enrolled music courses.
MUS-201, _Digital Music-Making_ [41], was enrolled at nearly twice
capacity, with thirty-nine students in a class capped at twenty.  It was
also listed as "Staff".  It now has nineteen students and is still 
listed as "Staff".  That course is hard enough to staff that I expect
that it would be impossible to offer a second section.

I had commented on the difficulty in managing the CCB process for
Mathematics.  Given the number of lessons, I expect that it's even
worse in Music.  I appreciate the hard work of the Chair and whoever
else supports them in that endeavor.  I hope that the Chair of Music
gets an annual course release [42].

Moving on, PCS-195, _ST: Mediation/Conflict Trnsfm_, one of the special
topics course in Peace and Conflict Studies, had eighteen students enrolled
in a course with a cap of sixteen.  It's another of those half-semester,
Monday-evening, one-credit courses that seem to be popular with students.
It appears that they allowed all the students to remain in that course.

Like Music, Physical Education has a bunch of "practica" courses.  Let's
just go through them in a list.

* PHE-100-13, _Golf_, had fifteen enrolled with a cap of ten.  It now has
  thirteen enrolled.
* PHE-100-19A, _Rock Climbing_, had seventeen enrolled with a cap of seven.
  There was also a section B, presumably in the second half of the semester,
  that had three slots available.  Strangely enough, section 19A is down to
  five students and section 19B is up to six.
* PHE-100-21, _Indoor Soccer_, had twenty-four enrolled with a cap of
  twenty-two.    It's now up to twenty-five.
* PHE-100-32, _Volleyball_, had sixteen enrolled with a cap of fifteen.
  It remained the same.
* PHE-100-34, _Zumba_, had eighteen enrolled with a cap of twelve.
  It remained the same.
* PHE-100-41, _Beginning Weight Lifting_, had thirty-one enrolled with
  a cap of fifteen.  I wonder if the recent photos of Kumail Nanjiani '01
  had anything to do with that.  It's down to twenty-nine.  Is there 
  enough equipment in the gym to support that many students?
* PHE-100-48, _Yoga I_, had thirty enrolled with a cap of twenty.   It's
  down to eighteen.  Yoga provides a wonderful path to wellness; I wish we
  could support all of the interested students.

As is normal, PHE-202, _Coaching Methods_, is significantly over-enrolled.
There are forty students enrolled with a cap of twenty-four.  I've had a
good number of students take that course and it makes me happy that so
many of our students think about volunteer coaching after college.  As is
normal, they've cut the course.  There are now twenty-three students.

Section 2 of PHI-111, _Introduction to Philosophy_, had been over-enrolled
by two students, while there were open slots in both section 1 and
section 3, with the latter at the unpopular time of 3:00-3:50 p.m.
The two morning sections are now balanced, with five open slots and six
open slots, respectively.  Section 3 remains the outlier, with
twelve open slots.  I will admit that I still find it strange that
there are any open slots in PHI-111.  When I was a young faculty
member and we had the wonderful chaos of Harris Registration [43],
PHI-111 was often the first course to fill.

Section 3 of PHY-132, _General Physics II w/lab_ was over-enrolled by
nine students.  But section 1 had eleven open slots [44] and section 2 had
sixteen open slots.  After CCB, section 1 has five open slots, section
2 has four open slots, and section 3 has two open slots.  It appears that
Physics balances more like CS than Math does.

PHY-314-01, _Thermodyn/Statisticl Physics_ had sixteen students enrolled
and a cap of fifteen.  It's down to fifteen.  It appears one student
was dropped or was convinced to switch to another class.  In contrast,
PHY-337-01, _Optics Wave Phenomena w/lab_, went from one available space
to being over-enrolled by one.

POL-101, like many 100-level courses we've looked at, also has an
imbalance between sections.  While section 2, at 1:00 pm, was over-enrolled
by seven students, section 1, at 8:00 a.m., had thirteen open slots, and
section 3, at 3:00 p.m., had eleven open slots.  After CCB, section 1 has
four open slots, section 2 has 1 open slot, and section 3 has five open
slots.  It appears that in addition to balancing the three sections, they've
added some students.

POL-216, _Politics of Congress_, had thirty-five students enrolled
and a cap of twenty-five.  After CCB, it had twenty-six students
enrolled.  I wonder if some of those students moved to POL-220,
_Foundations of Policy Analysis_, or POL-250, _Politics of Intern'l
Relations_.  And isn't POL-250 usually incredibly over-enrolled,
or is that another of Wayne Moyer's courses?  Speaking of over-enrolled
Wayne Moyer courses, POL-259, _Hmn Rts, Fndtn, Chlngs, Choice_,
which I interpret as "Human Relations, Foundations, Challenges, and
Choice", but which turns out to be "Human Rights: Foundations,
Challenges, and Choices", had twenty-eight students and a cap of
twenty-five at the end of preregistration and remains with twenty-eight
students.

Special Topics courses in Political Science seem to be popular.  POL-295-01,
_ST: Political Polling_, had twenty students and a cap of fifteen.  Who
wouldn't have an opportunity to work with the Grinnell poll, particularly
in its early days [46]?  It's now down to fourteen.  POL-295-02, _ST: Political
Violence_, had twenty-eight students enrolled with a cap of twenty-five?
Why did a 200-level special topics course have a cap of twenty-five?  I'm
not sure.  I should do a study of caps on special topics courses [47].  In
any case, after CCB it is now down to twenty-five.  POL-395-01, _ST: 
Intl Pol Organized Crime_, had nineteen students enrolled and a cap of 
fifteen.  It is now down to sixteen students.

Political Science is one of our most popular majors.  It looks like their
classes are generally quite full.  Is it another department that the College
should be thinking about expanding?

PSY-395, _ST: Neural Plasticity_, had nineteen students enrolled in a class
with a cap of fifteen.  It's been cut to that cap.

As I've noted before, RUS-195-01, _ST: Soviet Food Culture_, was one of
our most over-enrolled classes, reaching the level of studio art.  Todd
had sixty-seven students enrolled and a cap of fifteen.  Given that he's
teaching it in the new Global Kitchen, I'm surprised that he's allowing
as many as fifteen in the course.  I'm glad to see that he's added a 
second section, which allows him to support thirty-students between the
two sections.  I hope he has time amidst his far-too-many duties as
Chair of the Faculty.  I suppose I should ease off on the email I send him.

SOC-111, _Introduction to Sociology_, breaks the mold for 100-level
sociology classes.  Section 1, at 8:00 a.m., was over-enrolled by
one.  Section 4, at 3:00 p.m., was over-enrolled by eight.  Of
course, Section 5, on Tuesday/Thursday from 1:00-2:20, is the most
over-enrolled, with eleven students too many.  If I count correctly,
there were exactly enough slots in other sections to balance the
course.  And that seems to be what they did.  There is now one slot
in section 1, one slot in section 2, no slots in section 3, one slot
in section 4, and no slots in section 5.  Rarely do things work out
that well.  It's also cool to see that there are 125 students in
Intro Soc this spring.

At the 200-level, there were a lot of over-full classes.  SOC-250,
_Sociology of Religion_, had twenty-six students enrolled in a
course with a cap of twenty-five.  Since the other 200-level SOC
courses are capped at twenty-two, I assume that it should also have
been capped at that level.  That course was cut to the cap of
twenty-five.  SOC-255, _Sociology of Asian America_, had thirty-one
students with a cap of twenty-two.  It's down to twenty-three.
SOC-265, _Sociology of Health & Illness_, had thirty-seven enrolled
with a cap of twenty-two.  It's down to twenty-four.  I wonder what
happened to all the students who were cut from 200-level SOC courses.
It's not like there's a lot of room in their other courses, and
it's not like the other courses meet the same intellectual desires
as the ones they were cut from.  Of course, there were slots in
SOC-220, _Sociology of Global Development_, which is traditionally
quite popular, and SOC-240, _Social Movements_, which is also usually
quite popular.  And it does appear that there are fewer slots in
each.

SPN-317, _Readings in US Latinx Lit/Cult_, had twenty-six students
enrolled and a cap of fifteen.  That feels like a hard course to cut
students from.  Admittedly, every course is hard to cut students
from.  But original language, upper-level literature courses are
a special breed.  I was going to say, "If I were Chair, I'd do what
I could to find a way to offer another section", but it appears they
did just that.  There are now two sections, one with sixteen students
and one with ten.  It looks like Spanish had to cut SPN-105, _Introduction
to Spanish Lang I_, and shuffle some teaching responsibilities to do so.
I know those kinds of decisions are hard.

Spanish also had one other over-enrolled course, SPN-385, _Stds Contemp
Span Lit & Film_, which I originally read as "Standards" but quickly
realized was "Studies".  It had one more student than the capacity and
remains in that state.  It's good to see Spanish doing well in terms of
enrollments.

SST-115-01, _Introduction to Statistics_, had thirty-three students
enrolled and a cap of twenty-eight.  That course raises so many
thoughts.  Why do we have only one section when we used to need
three or four each semester?  Because students are now taking
STA-209, _Applied Statistics_, instead [48].  Why is it "SST" rather
than "STA"?  That I'm less sure about; I think it's because the
Statistics Faculty don't necessarily have control of the curriculum
and it does not count toward the Math/Stats major.  In any case,
after CCB, the course is down to twenty-eight.  I wonder what happens
to the five students who wanted statistics, presumably as a major
requirement or a desire to cover the "quantitative thinking" aspect
of Grinnell's elements of a liberal arts education.  I also know that
there's not much we could do about it.

On to STA-209, _Applied Statistics_.  How does STA-209 differ from
SST-115, other than in the numbering?  We require that students who
take the latter course have had some Calculus.  That knowledge should
allow the students to derive some key formulae, such as those relating
to the normal curve.  But it's also an issue of mathematical maturity.
I loved the students I taught in MAT/SST-115, they were bright and
inquisitive and willing to undertake the experiments in statistics
pedagogy that I was imposing on them [49].  At the same time, some
of them struggled to add fractions.

In any case, STA-209 is a popular class. We used to offer one section
each semester.  We now offer four.  After preregistration, section
1 was over-enrolled by six students, section two had sixteen open
slots, section 3 had five open slots, and section 4 was over-enrolled
by forty-three students.  If I do the math correctly, even after
balancing we'd have twenty-eight students who could not be accommodated
in the four sections, which suggests the need for another section.
What happened?  It appears that we still have four sections.  Why
not add a new section?  Because it's hard to find someone to teach that
course, other than one of our regular faculty members, and all of them
are booked solid.  So, where do the four sections stand? Section
1 is full.  Section 2 has four open slots.  Section 3 has one open
slot.  Section 4 has no open slots.  They also switched the time
of Section 3 to match that of section 4.  I'm not sure why two
sections have open slots.  I assume that they'll get filled before the
semester starts.

The other 200-level Statistics course is STA-230, _Introduction to Data
Science_.  Section 1 was over-enrolled by nine students.  Section 2
was over-enrolled by ten students.  Once again, that's enough for another
section.  And, once again, it's not clear who could teach that.  I'm
trying to figure that out.  We have three tenure-line Statistics faculty.
We appear to have two multi-year visitors [50].  Everyone is teaching
this spring, and it doesn't cover the demand [51].

And that's it.  We're through the list of over-enrolled courses.  Does that
mean we're done with the musing?  Not quite.  As I was reading through the
list of courses, I realized that it would be fun to look at the names of
all of the independent study courses, such as guided readings and MAPs.

Here goes.

Anthropology has "Tourism and Study Abroad", "Environmental Impacts
of Iowa Agriculture", and "Ethnography of Rohingyas".

Studio Art has "Photographic Publication", "Advanced Oil Painting
Series", "Hybrid Investigation", "Narrative Illustration", "Visualizing
Post-Bodies", and "Analog Photography" [52].

Biological Chemistry has "HDX and LCMS of Peptides" [53], "Syn
Teixobactin Analogue", "Bio Eval of LUG Deriv", "HDX Mass Spec of
MTHFR" [54], "Char LNC-RNS in C elegan" [55], "LNC-RNA Express C
elegan", "M+ Alpha4 nAChR Intrfce", "Redox in Biology Cancer", "UB
Chain Formation E3s", and "Regulation of HECT E3s".  Wow!  That's
a lot.

Biology has "Global Prdctn/Cnsmptn", "Slug Stability in Cancer"
[56], "Fungal Litter Ecotypes", "Phage & Antibiotic Res", "Branched
Ubiquitin Chain", "Antibiotic Resistance", "UbChain Form by WWP1",
"Antibiotic Farm Runoff", and "Fungal Biology".

Chemistry has "Sustainable Polymers", "Synthesis SERS Substrate",
"Molecular Computations" [57], "Bacterial Hg Demeth", "Micro Syn Sub 
Alkenones", "Micro Syn Sub Chalcones", "Synthesis of TM Complexes",
"Rlx Study Metal Complexes", "Microbial Hg Demth", "Syn of Lug and
Deriv", "Tran Met Com Red Lig Cat" [58], "Exsy Rlx Std P-PPt Cmpds",
and "DFT Calcs, NMR of Cp2WH2".  That's also a lot.  Our Chemists
are busy.

Computer Science has "Robot Monoculr 3D Vision", "E-Cmrc Top-N Rec Sys",
"Start-up Knowledge Graph", "Txt2Img: Hybrid ML Model".

East Asian Studies has "Trad Japanese Math".  That sounds cool to me.  I
wonder how Traditional Japanese mathematics differs from other kinds of 
mathematics.

Economics has "Adv Political Economy" and "Christmas Lights & Creme".

Education has "Rural Education", "Educ and Foster Youth", "Implement
Law Teach Union" [61], and "NGO Spd Edu Ini for Kaya".

English has "Textual Orientations", "Religion & Af Am Lit Trad",
"Farewells in War & Peace", "Advanced Poetry Project", and "Novel
Writing".  John Garrison is teaching two of those, and is advisor
to a host of students, and is doing one of those courses with a
study-abroad component, and has a new leadership role in one of his
professional organizations, and attends a variety of events around
campus.  How does he find the time?

French has "Francophone Africa".

Gender, Women's, and Sexuality Studies has "Advanced Oral History".

German has "GRM Scientists & Politics"

Global Development Studies has "Discourses of Gender Dev", "Jewish
Identity in Iran", and "Poli Econ of Cooperative".

History has "Native American Identity", "Pop Devotion & the Rfmtn",
"History of Strategy", and "Omitted Native Voices".

Latin-American Studies has "Immigration Sentiment" and "Social Justice in
HS SPN".

Mathematics has "Curves/Riemann Services".

Music has "Approaches to Mus Listen" and "Mass Composition".  It also has
recitals, which are pretty close to independent studies.

Philosophy has "Hegel and Recognition".

Physics has "Math in Quantum Theory", "Wimshurst Mechanism" and
"Modeling Galaxy Remnants".

Political Science has "Qualitative Data Analysis" and "US, PRC, & Int'l 
Regimes".

Psychology has "Nudges for Messages", "Exam Func in L2 Learning",
"Sentence Comprehension", Children Face Scanning", and "Face
Processing & Memory".

Religious Studies has "Cavell and Criticism" and "Grace in Orthodoxy".

Sociology has "Pol of Mourning & Burial", "Adv Journlsm Exlprtns",
"Whiteness Envn Justice", "Community in Soc Movement", and "Rce
Brrrs in Clmte Mvmnt" [62].

Statistics has "Stat Learning Bias", which is being offered as both an
independent and a MAP.  Other departments have that, too, but it's most
obvious in Stats.

Theatre and Dance has "Machinal Production", "Stage Mngmt & Drctn", and
"Directing Cont Theatre".

I had not known that we had a THS-499 designation for theses.  I'm guessing
those are for independent majors.  In any case, there are eight of
them this spring: "Eng Lang Lrns in Nw Lx D", "Comp USUK Mat Rspn Immig",
"Invis Cancer Global", "Office Hours Emtnl Labor", "Music and
Neoliberalism", "Beyond Baldwin & Julien", "Language of Biophilia", and
the creatively named "Senior Thesis Film".


That's it for the independent-study courses I could find.  I may have missed
a few of them.

One more thing: I had a few special courses I was watching, Georgeanna
Robinson's SST-195-04, _How Colleges Work_, Jon Andelson and Mark Baechtel's
HUM-205-03, _ST: Dig Journal Publishing_, and Belinda Backous' ASC-101-01,
_Scholar's Seminar_.  If I recall correctly, the first two courses got left
out of the list of courses for at least the first half of prereg, which
meant that students and advisors did not know about them.  SST-195 is up
to six students, which should be enough to allow an offering.  HUM-295
is doing less well, with only four students.  But it's still on the list, which
I take as a good sign.  ASC-101 doesn't usually get students until after
grades are turned in and addressed by the Committee on Academic Standing.

---

Postscript: You may wonder why some courses, after cutting, are below
capacity.  In my experience, that's usually because the instructor cuts
to capacity and then one of the students who stayed decides to take another
course or to take some time off from Grinnell.  I know that, on occasion,
I've asked to cut a course to below capacity to allow some of the cut
students to petition to get back into the course; the Registrar has not
generally looked favorably on that approach.

---

Postscript: As I noted, some parts of this musing felt like a slog while
I was doing the analysis and writing.  However, things picked up at
certain points.  I felt quite engaged while writing about Mathematics
and Music, perhaps because some interesting things are happening
with enrollments in each department.

---

Postscript: It may not surprise you to know that I regularly misspell
words and make typos.  I usually count on spell checkers to catch those
mistakes.  The number of strange abbreviations in the course titles,
as well as the number of faculty names, made spell checking a much less
pleasant experience.  I wonder how many things I accidentally corrected.

---

Postscript: Not only is this musing one of the longest I've written
in terms of word count [63] and the the number of endnotes [64],
it also seems to have taken me much longer than any prior musing.
I'm not sure exactly how much time it took since I wrote it over
multiple sessions, but I expect that it's over eight hours [65].
I don't think I'll regularly have the time to write this much for
a single musing.

Is there a return value on musings like this?  As I said, I learn
some things through this activity.  But I don't learn enough to
make it worth eight hours of my time.  Others may learn a bit.
Again, it's probably not enough.  However, a few of these musings
have made a difference with staffing; if I recall correctly, they've
helped us with Linguistics and CS.  If they also help with Studio
Art, or Russian Cooking [66], or Mathematics, or Statistics, or
Latinx literature, they are probably worth it.

If you can't help teach these courses [67] but have some spare
cash, you could donate to help one of these endeavors.  At the high
end, you could consider endowing a professorship in one of the
aforementioned departments [68].  Somewhere in the middle, you might
donate to name the Global Kitchen, unless it's named already.  I'd
suggest naming it after the Mohans or Todd Armstrong, but there are
certainly other opportunities.

Well, enough of that digression.  I hope you enjoyed some part of this
musing, as you will be unlikely to see many more of its like again, at
least in semesters when I'm not on leave [69].

---

[1] Is that the right adjective?  I write one every semester.  I suppose
I could write semiannual or biannual.  But I'd rather tie to the semester
than to the year.

[2] Perhaps someday it will evolve into "individually advised registration".

[3] I viewed that page on 15 December 2019.  It may have been updated
by the time you read this musing.

[4] See the prior footnote.

[5] Most students manage to clean up their schedules by the end of
the semester, particularly since the paperwork gets more complex after
that point.

[6] Alternative Language Study, not Lou Gehrig's disease.

[7] Yes, I realize that the word is normally spelled "Designing".  But
it appears in the schedule of courses with only one "n".

[8] I try not to make assumptions about gender, so I'm making it a habit
to use "they" and "them" as pronouns, even for people whose gender I think
I know.

[9] I do not know all of the details.  What I do know is that studio
classes generally used to meet for two three-hour sessions per week.
Some people, including me, suggested that that load was high,
particularly in three-course semesters, and that the Studio Art
faculty, like the Science faculty, should get 1.5 teaching credits
for courses that meet six hours per week.  I assume that that didn't
happen, and Studio decided to cut back to the more standard "2x80"
meeting schedule.

[10] Ah, the power of SamR's musings.  Someone read in a prior
musing that we might need a new person to teach CSC-105 and volunteered
themselves.  From what I can tell, they'll do a great job.  Strangely
enough, this is not the first time that one of my comments in a
musing about staffing has led to someone offering to teach a course.
However, the other time it was for another department.

[11] I would suggest that most classes involve some form of creativity.

[12] I've given up trying to spell Bakopoulos.

[14] Or _Intro Gndr, Wmn's & Sxlty Stud_, as it's listed in the
course catalog.

[15] It's also listed as EDU-210.  I'm not sure why I didn't cover it there.

[16] But not an endnote.

[17] Or at least you would if I were teaching the course [18].

[18] Which suggests, among other things, that it's probably a good thing
that I'm not teaching the course.

[19] Andrew Sherburne '01 is teaching the course.  Andrew was a dual
CS/Studio Art major.  Since graduating, he's been making documentary
films and running a great movie theatre in Iowa City.  I think he's
opened a second one, or at least he is helping manage a new one.  Now
there are two open slots.  That seems strange.  Since it's a short
course, I would have bribed him to offer a second section.

[20] Did you know that there was once a time in which you could not
cross-list a course between a concentration and a department?  Or
maybe it was between a division and a department.  In any case, I'm
pretty sure that those restrictions are long passed.

[21] I know the answer to that: Henry Walker.

[22] I suppose some might suggest that we could tell students to
choose another major.  However, that does not strike me as a good
idea.  It may also be that some non-majors are taking [23]
MAT-321.  Those may seem like natural students to drop.  However,
if you have a student qualified to take a course like MAT-321 and
qualified to take the course, it's hard to tell them no.

[23] Or hoping to take.

[24] And yes, it still has a cap of twelve.

[25] Arnie Adelberg, Marc Chamberland [26], Gene Hermann, Chuck
Jepsen, Charles Jones [27], Emily Moore, and Royce Wolfe. Emily was
in a shared position with Tom Moore, who mostly taught Statistics.
However, I think between the two of them, they taught the equivalent
of one full person in Mathematics.

[26] Marc started the same time I did, so it's not quite accurate
to say that he was there "when I started", but it's close enough.

[27] I've now been at Grinnell long enough that I could no longer
remember whether Jones left immediately before I arrived or soon
thereafter.  Fortunately, [a piece he wrote for MAA
news](http://sections.maa.org/iowa/Newsletters/Past/OlderPDF-only/MAANewsletterFall1997.pdf)
about the status of the department in Fall 1997 survives on the
Interweb.

[28] We also had two other folks with Ph.D.'s in Mathematics: Henry
Walker, who I believe had moved to teaching CS exclusively as part
of the deal that got me hired, and Pam Ferguson, who was president
of Grinnell.  Coincidentally, Henry and Pam had taught Calculus
together.  I still remember Henry telling me that since he and Pam
did different kinds of mathematics, they approached the course very
differently.  How's that for interdisciplinarity?

[29] Jeff Blanchard, Marc Chamberland, Chris French, Joe Mileti,
Jen Paulhus, Karen Shuman, and Royce Wolfe.

[30] I'm not saying that's a good thing; I'm just reporting on the data.

[31] When I started, we had Tom Moore in a shared position with
Emily Moore, who taught only Math [32] and Tom taught some Calculus
as well as Statistics.  Now we have Pam Fellers, Jeff Jonkman, and
Shonda Kuiper.  I think the department promised that Pam would do
some math teaching when we hired her. But "almost three" turns out
to be not enough for the demand in Statistics, either.

[32] And CS, before I arrived at Grinnell.

[33] Grinnell has a department of French and Arabic.

[34] Also called "Performance" courses.

[35] If I recall correctly, MUS-220 is covered under the "everyone
student gets a series of lessons each semester" policy, but MUS-221
requires an extra fee.

[36] Plus, I would hope, some base amount.

[37] That certainly sounds like a full-time job, if not more.

[38] Don't ask me to explain that.  I had thought it was a shorthand
for "This person normally teaches this section, but won't this semester."
However, it is marked as "Open" rather than "Closed", "Canceled",
or "Balanced".

[39] There's also an "Advanced Cornetta", but I assume that's a typo.

[40] I counted by hand, rather than using a spreadsheet, so I may be off
a bit.

[41] That's an unnecessary hyphen.

[42] Up until a few years ago, most Department chairs got a full-course
release every-other year, or a half-course release each year.  In
a few departments with particularly large administrative burdens,
such as Music, Chairs got annual full-course releases.  Then we
moved Chair from an expected two-year term to an expected three-year
term, and the release from one every two years to two every three
years.  I recall being surprised in hearing that this meant that in some
departments, the Chair's release would decrease, rather than increase and,
even though CS was a relatively small department at the time, I argued
that those departments with high administrative burdens should still get
an annual full-course release for the Chair.  I recall unanimity among
the faculty about retaining annual releases from some chair, but strong
pushback from the Administration.  I'm not sure what the conclusion was.

[43] While I know that our current system for registering incoming
first-year students is fairer, I miss Harris registration.  I felt
like I learned something looking at where lines were forming and I
appreciated the chance to talk to students face to face.  Plus,
since CS was not all that popular, I could wander around, hand
students candy, and then ask them if they'd been taught not to
accept candy from strangers.

[44] You may not be surprised to hear that section 1 was at t8:00 a.m.
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

[45] The answer.

[46] Did I include that in my list of courses I'd like to take this spring?
If not, I should have.

[47] My initially empty list of potential musings for 2020 is growing
rapidly.

[48] More on that course in a bit.

[49] Workshop-style statistics was an obvious innovation.  R was a less
obvious one, particularly since R did not have a nice UI at the time.

[50] I write "appear to" because I don't know the status of our visitors.

[51] I was going to write "the need", but it's not clear that any
particular student explicitly needs either course.  On the other
hand, I would argue that at this time, every liberally educated
student needs some statistical literacy.

[52] That reminds me: We have analog photography supplies in the basement
of 1127 Park.  I wonder if we can give them to the Art department.  I wonder
who I should talk to.  I'll work on that question next week.

[53] Chemistry is not my forte.  LMS stands for Learning Management System.
CMS stands for Content Management System.  That suggests that LCMS stands
for Learning Content Management System.  No, I don't think that's right.
As I said, Chemistry is not my strong suit.

[54] I don't think you want to hear how I read "MTHFR".

[55] Arguably, that should be _C. elegans_.

[56] I did not know that slugs contributed to cancer.  I'll need to keep more
salt around.

[57] I don't think that's the kind of molecular computation that my 
former CS colleague, Titus Klinge, studied.

[58] I definitely have no clue about this one.  But then I have little clue
about most of the Chemistry titles and abbreviations [59].  

[59] Some might argue that I have little clue on most topics.

[60] Heinz.

[61] I can't parse that one, either, which suggests that a prior endnote
may be more accurate than I thought.

[62] I like "Brrrs", which makes me think of shivering, in the title of
a research project on the climate movement.  And yes, I understand that
it stands for "barriers".

[63] Over 8000 words, at last count.

[64] That should be obvious from this number, even though there are still
a few after this one..

[65] I'm also counting the time it took to read through and organize data.

[66] That would probably require that we open another evening class time.

[67] Or the College won't allow the appropriate department to hire you.

[68] Or, I suppose, in any department.

[69] Since I'm on leave for spring 2020, I may still be able to do
one for fall 2020.  We'll see how things are going then and how
much homework Ralph and Justin are giving me.

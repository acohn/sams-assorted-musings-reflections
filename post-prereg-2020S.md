Post-preregistration for spring 2020
====================================

_Topics/tags: [Registration](index-registration), [Grinnell](index-grinnell), assorted data, rambly, long_

A few weeks ago, I wrote my semesterly [1] musing on preregistration,
this one on [preregistration for spring 2020](prereg-2020S).  I
realize that I'm supposed to call it "open registration" rather
than "preregistration" [2].  But [the list of faculty dates to
remember](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Lists/FacDates/Deadlines.aspx)
[3] still calls it "preregistration", as does [the list of student dates
to remember](https://www.grinnell.edu/about-grinnell/leadership-and-administration/offices-and-services/registrar/calendars/student-dates?v2node) [4].
So I'm going to stick with "preregistration", at least for the time being.

I find it interesting to compare the state of our registration between
the end of preregistration and after cuts, closes, and balances have
happened.  This year, I've waited a week or two extra, which should have
allowed some students an opportunity to add courses.

What are some of the interesting changes I've observed?  

As expected, ALS [5] has gone from an over-enrolled 0-credit course
with eighteen students to six different courses (Italian I, Hindi
I, Brazilian Portuguese I, Hungarian I, Korean II, and Korean III),
each with about two students.  It's also still still an over-enrolled
course with twenty-one students.

Katya and Leslie's AMS/ANT/BIO-220, _Racing Through Genetics_, has gone from
24 students to 22, but remains over-enrolled.  I assume they couldn't
bear to cut more than two students, or perhaps two students volunteered
to switch to another course.

The four sections of ANT-104, _Anthropological Inquiries_, which were
over-enrolled by about one section's worth of students, are now five
sections of ANT-104.  It's nice of Tess Kulstad to pick up another
section.  I hope we're compensating Tess appropriately.

Kathy Kamp and Lesley Wright cut about fourteen people from
ANT/HUM-205, _Desiging Museum Displays_ [6].

The two over-enrolled sections of ART-111, _Introduction to the
Studio_, have become three sections of ART-111.  One person is
teaching all three sections, and the sections are all Tuesday/Thursday.
I do not envy them [7] those days.  I guess that's a positive side
effect of the change in in-class time for the studio classes [8].
In contrast, there is not a new section of _Drawing_.  But Jeremy Chen
is already teaching three courses in the spring.  Four would be awful.
It looks like Jeremy couldn't bear to kick people out of ART-240,
_Ceramics_, so that course is still slightly over-enrolled.

ASC-101, _Scholars Seminar_, is still being offered, even though it
has only two students.  But it's a one-credit course, and many students
end up adding it after they see how they do in their first semester at
Grinnell.

Somehow, nine students got cut from BCM-262-01, _Intro Biological
Chem w/lab_, but there are still slots open in BCM-262-02.  I don't
know what's up with that.  Perhaps they are allowing the students
who got cut to petition to get into the other section.  I know that
there are years in which they've allowed that course to significantly
over-enroll, but that's not healthy for faculty.

Speaking of leaving courses over-enrolled, it appears Clark has kept
24 students in BIO 263, _Neurobiology_, even though it's officially
capped at 18.  The labs are also over-enrolled, presumably at the number
of students who can safely work in the lab space.

Elswehwere in Biology, BIO-252, _Organisms, Evolution, and Ecology
with Lab_ appears to have managed to balance its sections and even
add a few more people.  CHM-129, _General Chemistry w/Lab_, also seems
to have balanced its sections.  The most-overenrolled section is now
the only one that's not over-enrolled, but I think that's because it's
the workshop section.

Back to over-enrolled courses, it looks like each section of CHM-222,
_Organic Chemistry II_, is over-enrolled by seven students.  You'd
think that they'd add another section rather than add that many
students to each class.  But perhaps they couldn't find someone to
staff another section, perhaps they couldn't find a space to offer
it, or perhaps the Dean wouldn't come up with the money.  In any case,
Organic II is important enough that I expect they felt that they could
not cut anyone.  At least they have enough lab offerings!

Next up is my department, Computer Science.  We balanced the three
sections of CSC-151, _Functional Problem Solving w/lab_ and were
still able to allow a few more students in.  I know that some
first-year students were frustrated that they got cut in the fall,
but we managed to meet all the demand in the spring.  Six sections
per year seems to suffice.

CSC-261, _Imperative Problem Solving w/lab_ was our hardest course
to handle.  We were over-enrolled by twenty students and could not
fit that many in the classroom.  Barbara Johnson graciously agreed
to switch from CSC-105 to open a third section.  And we were able
to find someone else interested in teaching CSC-105 [9].  I see
that most of our courses are at or near capacity, which seems to
be the norm these days.  I'm a bit surprised to see that both
sections of CSC-326 are left as open, given that we over-enrolled
CSC-324 with the understanding that it used the open slots in 324.
I've [written enough about other cut, close, and balance issues in
my department](ccb-2019-11-24) that I don't think there's much more
to add.

I'm surprised to see that Economics cut one section of ECN-111,
_Introduction to Economics_.  They usually fill as many sections as they
can offer.  Maybe students are heading over to Anthropology instead.
It looks like section 1 of ECN-286, _Econometrics_ is still over-filled
and there is room in section 2.  They seem to have tried to balance
them.  It seems strange that the 8:00 a.m. section is over-enrolled.
There's more room in ECN-329, _Advanced Econometrics_, and
ECN-338, _Applied Game Theory_, than I would expect.  Otherwise,
everything seems pretty much full.  I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the 30 students who they needed to cut from Brad
Graham's _Economics of Innovation_.

On to Education.  EDU-101, _Educational Princiles in a Pluralistic
Society_ was over-enrolled during pre-registration.  It doesn't
look like they were able to find room for everyone.  Two classes
are cancelled, but they were canelled before preregistration.
Nothing else seems particularly surprising.

English seems to have balanced the enrollments in ENG-120, _Literary
Analysis_.    Both sections of ENG-205, _The Craft of Fiction_, are
now full.  I think that means that they needed to cut 33 students.
There does seem to be strong demand for courses that explicitly
focus on creativity [10].  Dean B's [11] evening course in
screenwriting is also full.  I'm glad that there are still a few
slots in Ralph's morning class in Ralph's ENG-207, _Craft of
Creative Nonfiction_.  That means he'll let me in.  I see that
John Garrison has continued his practice of allowing his 300-level
classes to over-enroll.  There are eighteen in ENG-316, _Studies
in English Renaissance Literature_.  It sounds like his practice is
carrying on to others, too.  Makeba Lavan, who I don't know, is
allowing sixteen into _ENG-229, _Studies in African American Literature_.

All of the Environmental studies courses are full.  I wonder who
is teaching ENG-295, the special topics course on _Climate Change
and Indigenous People_.  It seems very popular (and very interesting).

There's not a lot to report on in French.  It appears that FRN-103,
_Accelerated Introduction to French_, was cancelled.  I wonder what
happens to the students who had enrolled in the course; it's easy to 
lose a language if you take too much time off.  I'm glad to see that
French is doing well at the 300-level; they clearly need both sections
of FRN-305, _Contemporary Francophone Culture_.

Switching to a somewhat older language, I'm thrilled to see that
GRE-222, _Intermediate Greek_, is completely full.

I'm happy to see that the German Lab that was scheduled on Thursdays
at 11:00 has now moved to Thursdays at 1:00.  Nothing should be
scheduled at the same time as Scholars' Convocation.  I wonder if
the original was just a typo.

At the end of preregistration, section 1 of GWS-111, _Introduction to
Gender, Women's, & Sexualty Studies_ [12] was over-enrolled by twenty-five
students and section 2 had three slots.  Now section 1 is exactly
full and section 2 is over-enrolled by one student.  I don't
understand these things.  Tamara Beauboeuf's special topic on
_Educating Women_ is still over-enrolled by two.

_You know what?  I'm getting a bit sick of all of this.  Why am I doing
it again?  Oh, that's right.  More knowledge helps.  Okay, I'm going
to press on.  I'll probably focus mostly on courses that were 
over-enrolled at the preregistration._

What's next?  History.  HIS-210, _Historical Perspectives on US
Education_ was over-enrolled by three students.  Now it's over-enrolled
by two.

[1] Is that the right adjective?  I write one every semester.  I suppose
I could write semiannual or biannual.  But I'd rather tie to the semester
than to the year.

[2] Perhaps someday it will evolve into "individually advised registration".

[3] I viewed that page on 15 December 2019.  It may have been updated
by the time you read this musing.

[4] See the prior footnote.

[5] Alternative Language Study, not Lou Gehrig's disease.

[6] Yes, I realize that the word is normally spelled "Designing".  But
it appears in the schedule of courses with only one "n".

[7] I try not to make assumptions about gender, so I'm making it a habit
to use "they" and "them" as pronouns, even for people whose gender I think
I know.

[8] I do not know all of the details.  What I do know is that studio 
classes generally used to meet for two three-hour sessions per week.
A number of people, including me, suggested that that load was high,
particularly in three-course semesters, and that the Studio Art faculty,
like the Science faculty, should get 1.5 teaching credits for courses
that meet six hours per week.  I assume that that didn't happen, and
Studio decided to cut back to the more standard "2x80" meeting schedule.

[9] Ah, the power of SamR's musings.  Someone read in a prior musing that
we might need a new person to teach CSC-105 and volunteered themselves.
From what I can tell, they'll do a great job.  Strangely enough, this is
not the first time that a comment in a musing about staffing has led to
someone offering to teach a course.  However, the other time it was for
another department.

[10] I would suggest that most classes involve some form of creativity.

[11] I've given up trying to spell Bakopoulos.

[12] Or _Intro Gndr, Wmn's & Sxlty Stud_, as it's listed in the
course catalog.

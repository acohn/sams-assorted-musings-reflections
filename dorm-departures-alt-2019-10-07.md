Dorm departures

One of the disadvantages of being on sabbatical is that I am less
aware of what is happening on campus [1].  I don't always get the
_Scarlet and Black_ and I don't hear as much from students and
colleagues because I don't see nearly as many students or colleagues.
But occasionally one of them sends me something of interest.
Recently, one pointed me to [an article in the
_S&B_](https://grinnell.formstack.com/forms/shuttle_signup).  My
colleague and the article pointed out a new addition to the
_Student Handbook_.

> Non-graduates are required to check-out within 24 hours of their last final exam; Graduates are required to checkout by noon the day after Commencement. [2]

I understand why folks in the administration thought things needed
to change; as the _S&B_ article suggests, some students who finished
their work early in the spring were less than responsible during
the time after they finished and their escapades added burdens to
Student Affairs and interfered with the ability of their dorm-mates
to do their work [4].  Traditionally, issues like this are handled
by techniques of Self Governance and, if necessary, by JudCo [5].
But the administration seems to have gone with a new policy instead.

What's wrong with the policy?  Lots of things.  Let's see how many
I can come up with [6].

All work at the College is due at 5 p.m. on Friday of Finals Week.
Students who have exams on Tuesday may still have a paper due for
the same class on Friday.  Many students don't know in advance when
they will finish their work [7].  So how can they use the "last final"
as an indicator?

Parents are told not to plan to have students come home earlier in the
week.  Students are supposed to make sure all of their work done before
they leave, so many parents who buy tickets early take that as a sign
that they should just buy tickets for Friday afternoon or Saturday
morning.

In fact, the College [only provides transportation to the airport on Friday and
Saturday](https://grinnell.formstack.com/forms/shuttle_signup).  If
students finish earlier in the week, what are they supposed to do until
then if they can't stay in the dorms?

Our dining plans last until Friday of Finals' week.  If students plan
to eat in the dining hall for the week, shouldn't they also be able to
stay in the dorms, too?  If we're forcing them to leave, should we
also refund part of their dining plans?

Someone has to work in the dining hall that week, too.  Some students
who finish their finals early will want to pick up extra hours later
in the week.  And students with finals later in the week will likely
prefer to have others take their shifts [8].

This decision runs counter to a push by many students to find a way to allow
all students to stay through graduation in the spring.  After all, non-seniors
have seniors as friends and may want to stay to watch graduation.

Some students stay in the dorms over winter break.  Do they have
to leave after their final and then come back again [9]?

Then there's this wonderful quotation from the article [10].

> Indeed, many of the logistics of the policy have not been made clear yet, and when asked about how the administration will keep track of each studentâ€™s last final and when they need to have left, both [the Dean of Students] and [the Director of Residence Life] admitted to not having an answer.

How can you set up a policy without having the associated process [11]?

Those are my initial concerns.  I'm sure if I took some more time, I'd
come up with others.  

Oh, there's one more.  As you'd expect, it has to do with shared
governance.  It would be nice to know that this policy had been
discussed with the faculty and with students.  It appears that it
was not [12].  That makes me sad.

[1] Maybe that's an advantage of being on sabbatical.

[3] At least it's currently available at the URL.  I'm not sure what happens
to old student handbooks on that server.

[4] I know none of this for a fact.  I am interpreting from what I read
in the article.

[6] Some of these are gathered from conversations with others and from
articles in the _S&B_ and the _B&S_.

[7] In most cases, the syllabus specifies what work is due during
finals week.  However, students are not always good at predicting how
long that work will take.  In addition, some students ask for short
extensions toward the end of the semester.  Those are hard to predict
in advance.

[8] I've been told that neglecting to consider dining hall issues
was also a problem this fall; the timing of the First-Year Experience
means that there are rarely enough students to work Monday nights in
the dining hall.

[9] I assume that the answer is "They can stay."  But I worry about
policies that create situations like this.

[10] It is the _S&B_, so it's possible that they got it wrong.

[11] Don't answer that; it happens all the time.

[12] It may have been discussed with someone in the Dean's office.  As
many readers know from my recent musings, I've started to lose faith
in the Dean's office as an appropriate representative of the faculty.

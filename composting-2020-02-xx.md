This year, some friends have started posting a series of ways to make
a difference, if only a small difference, in your impact on the world.
And even if it's only a small difference, a lot of small differences
can add up to a large difference.  In any case, their posts reminded
me that I should be composting stuff, particularly since I'm making an
increased effort to eat fresh fruits and vegetables.  But we don't
have a compost bin set up.  I'm pretty sure that I bought the one
we have in the basement a decade ago.  I was hoping to set it up
on a recent weekend, but [I've been busy](index-overcommitment).

So what are my options?  I started freezing stuff.  Then I realized that
I was generating enough vegetable and fruit waste [1] that our freezer would
fill too quickly. Then I thought to myself, "I can use a garbage bin to
hold waste until I set up the compost bin." That also seemed like a way
to deal with waste once the compost bin is full [2] and turning its
contents to dirt.

Then I asked myself, "Can't I just use a garbage bin for composting?"
The answer is, unsurprisingly,
[Yes](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-make-a-compost-bin-from-a-garbage-can-1388581).

I'm still planning to build the rolling ball composter that's lived in
our basement for way too long, but it's nice to know that I have other
options.

[1] Also meat waste, but that's a separate issue.  I need a good process
to save such waste for the College's industrial composting.

[2] If I ever get it set up.

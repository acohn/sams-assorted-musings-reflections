I have a lot of cool friends. I get reminded of that when I see or
hear about their accomplishments, their activities, their events.
This friend received an award for mentoring women.  This friend
hosted what sounds like an incredible house concert.  This friend
taught a MOOC to tens of thousands of people.  This friend made a
real difference to someone.

I will admit that I am a bit broad in my definition of "friend". I
count many Grinnell colleagues, as well as CS colleagues from other
institutions, as friends, even if we wouldn't necessarily, say,
invite each other to our weddings [1].  I also count many alumni
as friends; I hope they think of themselves as my friends, too.

I was reminded of the joys of knowing cool people the other day
when the legendary Rachel Rose '01 posted a link to [an article on
the use of LucasFilm "Stagecraft" technology in _The
Mandalorian_](https://www.slashfilm.com/the-mandalorian-stagecraft-photos/)
[2].  For those who don't know Rachel, I'll just note that she's
been at LucasFilm ever since finishing her Ph.D. in Computer Graphics
at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and is one of the CG
supervisors on _The Mandalorian_.  I don't hear enough about the
particulars of Rachel's work (or maybe I don't ask enough), but I'm
pretty sure that she was closely involved in the Stagecraft technology,
which the article simplifies as something that "uses a rear-projected
LED screen to create a reactive environment that essentially works
as an immersive real-time green screen."

I already think the work I hear about is cool.  But what 
struck me when I saw the post is the kind of comments she got on
the post. People were not only commenting on her work on the project
but also asking about the technology, such as "Was this an extension
of the tech they were working on down on the mocap stage?"  How
many people work at a place that has a motion capture stage [4],
let alone have an impact on such wickedly awesome technologies?

I should try to convince Justin [6] to bring her back for his [Digital
Media Design for Performance](http://thd295.thomas.sites.grinnell.edu/)
class [7].  I should also keep Rachel in mind the next time there's
a call for honorary degree recipients.  Her work is artistic and
I'm pretty sure that she was a dual CS/English major (or at least
she loved taking courses from Ed Moore); perhaps we can give her
an honorary doctorate in humane letters.  Oh!  She'd also be a great
candidate for a Convocation.  And I should certainly write a more
complete musing about Rachel.  I have some notes for
such a musing that I started more than three years ago [8].  Stay
tuned.

**_Postscript_**: Rachel's husband, Jack the Druid '01, is differently
awesome, applying his training in Chemistry in new and interesting
ways.  I wonder if he'd take Middle on as an intern [9].

[1] No, I have no plans for another wedding.  Michelle and I have
completed thirty-three years of happy marriage and just celebrated
the thirty-fifth anniversary of our first engagement [3].

[2] My spell checker seems to think it should be _The Mendelian_.  A
Disney show about genetics would be cool.

[3] That's a story for another day.

[4] At least two Grinnell alums :-) [5].

[5] Are smiley faces appropriate in musings?

[6] Thomas, not Rose.

[7] I should also find out how you make subsites of your 
username.sites.grinnell.edu sites.

[8] Whoops.

[9] Middle is applying his Chemistry major in other, but somewhat related,
ways.  But you never know.

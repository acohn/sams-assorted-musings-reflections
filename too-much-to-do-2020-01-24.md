I spent most of yesterday AFK [1].  On the few occasions in which
I had a bit of free time, I tried to use my so-called smartphone
to catch up on my email.  Along the way, I made a list of things I
needed to do when I got back to town.  I think I came up with 45
or so tasks, most of which will take between five and fifteen minutes.
Of course, that's not all I have to do.  I also listed ten tasks
for the weekend, each of which will likely require an hour or more.
I wrote them down in the notebook I usually carry with me; if I'd
been more sensible, I would have recorded them in Todoist.  However,
"restart use of Todoist" is enough of a complicated task that I'm
leaving it for this weekend.  And you know what?  I didn't even list
the homework I have to do for Justin and Ralph.  There are times that
I very much empathize with Grinnell students.

I had hoped to check off some tasks in the afternoon or evening.
Unfortunately, I didn't make it back until 9:00 p.m. or so.  While
that may be early for some folks, it's late enough for me that I
accomplished none of them.  It didn't help that I'd gotten up at
before 6:00 a.m.  I did manage to [write a
musing](faculty-chair-2020-01-23), which I suppose should make me
proud.

Come Friday morning, I got into work at 7:45 a.m. and started to
prioritize.  Here's the order in which I did things once I got to
work [2].

First, I tried to fix the "e" key on my laptop's keyboard.  It
hasn't been functioning well.  It wasn't letting me type.  I did
the "obvious" thing, at least in my world, which is to pry off the
key and see what I can figure out.  It's an old scissor switch.  I
tried to figure it out, cleaned things up a bit, and pushed it back
into place.  It's was not perfect, but it seemed better.

Then I met with a student who was scheduled at 8:00 a.m.

After that, I started this musing.  That probably wasn't the best
use of my time.

I thought it would be good to drop a note to my Division Chair and
primary EC rep about my frustrations with the lack of announcement
about the temporary closure of SHIC [3].  I think the College had some
reasons to need to change how SHIC operates, but I would have preferred
to learn via an official message, rather than via Facebook.  And,
because I'm a buttinski, I wanted to make sure that appropriate resources
continued to be available.  We did get an explanation in the afternoon;
I wish we had gotten that first.

I received a note from CTLA [4] indicating that because of the
weather [5], we had some cancellations for the Faculty/Staff lunch
and we could try to recruit more people to come in their place.  I
posted a message to Facebook.  I was going to say that I have no
idea whether or not it had any effect, but I see that one of my
favorite colleagues was not on the original list and was at the
lunch.  Yay!

I went through email from my department that I could not read the prior
day.  Why couldn't I read it?  Because most of my department encrypts
email using PGP [6] and I can't [7] read encrypted email on my phone.

Somewhere along the way while I was doing all of that, I answered a variety
of short email messages that arrived.

I also cursed that my "e" key fix failed.  That is, it was back to
working intermittently rather than consistently, which meant that
I had to watch the screen to see whether or not it worked.

I'd received a request from this year's SIGCSE Student Volunteer
Wranglers to provide some documents from past years.  I dug those
up and sent them along.  Of course, I also wondered why they were
continuing to use the creaky old SV coordination software when the
Conference Chairs and the SIGCSE Board decided that we should get
rid of it. One of the reasons that I was comfortable passing on the
role of SV Wrangler was that I was told no one else would have to
figure out the system.  Perhaps it's time for SIGCSE to invest in the
necessary rewrite.

I had a 10:00 a.m. meeting at the Green Creepy-Face Credit Union
to learn about setting up accounts for political campaigns.  It
was planned as a meeting to set up an account, but I assumed that
we'd need to learn some more before doing so.  Before heading over,
I re-checked the information that I had received and had previously
skimmed.

On the way out, I met with colleagues in AIR to discuss today's
Faculty/Staff Friday.  I really appreciate having the AIR folks
around.

I visited GCFCU at the scheduled time to discuss the account. I was
correct; we needed an EIN [8], Articles of Incorporation [9], minutes
of the Meeting approving the use of GCFCU as our financial institution
[10], and a few other things.

I got to walk back through the snow.  Admittedly, I walked to the
GCFCU in the snow, too.  I need to find my boots.  Once I returned
to my office, I decided to log what I'd done in the morning.  I quickly
realized that "Green Creepy-Face Credit Union" has a lot of "e"s
in it.  Here's what I wrote [11] next.  I've intentionally kept it
in my not-so-grammatical form.

> Curse my keyboard.  Try to set up Bluetooth keyboard.  Realize
that it won't fit with the trackpad [14].  Curse some more.  Pound
on "e" key until it works, more or less.  Consider dropping note
to ITS to find out when the new MacBook arrives.  Note that they've
told me that they ordered it already and decide that a message would
just waste their time.

I then emailed the candidate to summarize my meeting with GCFCU.

There were a few short email messages to send on my list.  What
list?  The list of 45 things to do that I mentioned at the start.
I sent some of them.

Then I went over to the JRC to prepare for the Faculty/Staff Friday.
Because some colleagues have been posting about more sustainable
behavior, I brought my own plate, bowl, silverware, and napkin.
Because I am unable to free myself from some habits I developed in
graduate school, I also brought a bunch of reusable containers for
people to use to take leftovers.  I also brought pens and note cards.
A co-leader brought placards and markers.

There were a few minutes of downtime, so I used those to take some
notes on musings I had thought about on the way over.

And that was my morning.  

I'm not quite sure what I got done in the afternoon, other than
catching up on some email and dealing once again with my "e" key.
In the end, it broke completely.  I found my official Apple Bluetooth
Keyboard, which fits nicely over the MacBook keyboard.  However,
it was out of batteries.  My Apple Extended Keyboard didn't fit
nearly as well and required a USB port but at least it let me type.
Once I got home, I put new batteries in the Bluetooth Keyboard.
The "e" key works.  Unfortunately, the space bar doesn't work
consistently.  And it doesn't always let me tab between applications.
It's not my day.  I hope I get my new laptop soon, or at least that
I learn how to make keyboards work.

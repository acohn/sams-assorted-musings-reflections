This coming Monday is Martin Luther King Jr. Day or, as many refer
to it, MLK day.

A few years ago [1], the College faculty voted to stop holding
classes on MLK Day [2].  It was not a simple vote.  We spent time
discussing a wide variety of issues.  Some faculty were concerned
about losing a day of class; going from 42 classes to 41 may not
seem like a lot to you, but it felt like a lot to some people.  And,
for classes and labs that meet once per week, going from fourteen classes
to thirteen [4] is a big drop.

However, that wasn't the biggest concern.  The bigger concern was that
the point of MLK Day is to commemorate Dr. King and that canceling
classes doesn't quite achieve that.  Some were worried that the day off
would simply be an excuse for students to return to campus later.  Some
worried that students who returned and had nothing to do might behave
irresponsibly.

And so, as I understood it, the decision and subsequent vote were not
only that we stopped holding classes on MLK Day, but also that we 
provided some kind of meaningful activities for students to participate
in: talks, discussion groups, something like that.  Unfortunately, the
minutes of the Faculty Meeting don't document the discussions.

Equally unfortunately, like many decisions at the College, it was
made without any accompanying support structure.  So this year, as
in the past few years, we do not seem to have daytime activities to
celebrate Dr. King and his mission.  

I can't recall whether anyone noted that MLK Day is supposed to be
[a day of
service](https://www.nationalservice.gov/serve-your-community/mlk-day-service).
Given the knowledge and perspectives of the Grinnell Faculty, I'm
pretty sure that someone did.  And so I'd like to see the College
encourage students toward service.

Nonetheless, I am happy to see that the Rosenfield Program, the
Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and the Ombuds Office are arranging
some this year.  There are two talks by [Hasan
Davis](https://hasandavis.com/), one on Monday evening in the Loft
Theatre downtown and one on Tuesday evening in JRC 101 [5].

Since the College is making positive strides on diversity and inclusion,
and these are topics that Dean Harris is prioritizing, I look forward
to seeing what happens next year [6].  

Oh, never mind.  [For the next four years, MLK Day happens during
Winter
Break](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/registrar/calendars/5-year).
I hope that we still encourage students to do a day of service on
those MLK Days.

I'm also going to make sure that I do some appropriate service on
Monday, most likely in my role as a committee member for the Tapia
Celebration.

Postscript: I feel a bit bad saying that "Someone else should arrange
activities". If I think activities are important, and I do, perhaps
I should take a role in arranging activities.  However, I can't have
a role in everything.  Arguably, I shouldn't have a role in everything.
More importantly, there are many people on campus much better suited
to that role than I.

Postscript: The part of my brain that I never quite understand has the
following comments.

1. The initials for "Martin Luther King Jr." are "JKLM" backwards.

2. I wonder if they close MLK drive in Des Moines on Monday and hold
celebrations there.

[1] The amazing [Elaine Marzluff](elaine-marzluff) determined that the
discussion happened at [the meeting of April 21, 2014](https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/dean/Faculty_Meetings/Forms/Mtg_Materials.aspx?FilterField1=AcadYear&FilterValue1=2013%2D2014&FilterType1=Lookup&id=%2Fsites%2Fdean%2FFaculty%5FMeetings%2FFacMtgMinutes%5F04%5F21%5F14%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2Fdean%2FFaculty%5FMeetings).

[2] That is, on years in which our calendar would normally indicate that
the first day of class would be on MLK Day.  In some years, MLK Day falls
on the last week of break.  That's because the start date of our spring
semester is computed based on Memorial Day.  Let's see ... Graduation
is always one week before Memorial Day.  There are fourteen weeks of
class, one week of finals, and two weeks of spring break [3].  So the
first day of class should be eighteen weeks before Memorial Day.

[3] I seem to recall one year in which we had a one-week spring break,
but two weeks is our norm.

[4] For Monday labs and Monday night classes.

[5] As far as I can tell, our three biggest buildings are the Noyce
Science Center, the [Not Yet Named] Humanities and Social Studies
Center, and the Joe Rosenfield *Student* Center.  Why don't we use
the abbreviation JRSC?

[6] I also look forward to seeing the minutes of Faculty Meetings
more clearly reflect not just votes, but the discussions that led
to those votes.  Institutional memory needs to be stored somewhere,
and not just in the heads of some faculty members.

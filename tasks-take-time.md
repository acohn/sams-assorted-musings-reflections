Sometimes tasks take too much time
==================================

People who know me know that I'm perpetually behind in getting things done
(grading, paperwork, straightening my offices).  Many issues contribute
to being perpetually behind.  In part, I just have a lot of small things
to do [1] In part, it's because I'm tempted to do the easy tasks first,
rather than the difficult ones [2].  In part, I delay tasks because I've
already delayed them, and it's hard to get the energy to start a delayed
task.  But it's also that some tasks take much longer than they should.

Why do some of my tasks take too long?  Let's look at an example from a
recent evening.  I wanted to donate some money to Grinnell [3].  My
memory said "Oh, that'll be easy.  There's a big **Donate** button at
the top of every page on the Web site."  But it turns out I was wrong.
At some point, the College seems to have realized that it was a little
bit tacky to be so blatantly asking for money.  

So I did the next thing: I Googled "Donate to Grinnell" [4].  The first
thing that came up was "the Giving to Grinnell" page at forum.grinnell.edu.
I said to myself "Hmmm ... that's interesting.  I thought we discontinued
forum."  Now, most people who knew that we'd discontinued forum would
just scroll down until they found the right page.  But I clicked on the
link to see what would happen.  And then I waited, and waited, and waited.
At this point, most people would say "Okay, it's time to try a different
link."  But this is me.  So I took a snapshot of the screen, fired up
my email program, and sent a message to DAR saying "Maybe someone should
pay attention to this problem."

What's the next link?   A page entitled "Donate | Grinnell College".  Ah,
that sounds promising.  So I click on the link.  Guess what?  It's a
"Donate to the Liberal Arts in Prison Program" [6].  Fortunately, that
page links to the [College's brand new donation
form](https://alumni.grinnell.edu/donate).  Of course, that page is
entitled "Donation Form - Alumni - Grinnell College", which makes me
wonder if I'm allowed to use it.  Never mind, we'll press on.

I start to enter the donation information and then see that there's a
friendly line that reads "My company will math my gift - Look it up".
So I decide to see if Grinnell will match my gift to Grinnell [7].
And I discover that that feature is broken.  Do I say "That's not my
problem?" and go back to donating?  No, I take the time to document the
issue (including my browser and OS) and then send another message to DAR.

Oh, I also take the time to craft text that says that the money need not
be used within a particular time period [8].

And, after donating, I decide to check to see whether there's a real
donation history on the new site.  (The old site claimed to have a 
donation history, but didn't.)

Finally, after donating, I draft this essay.

So, what should have been a five-minute task, at most, has taken something 
like twenty minutes, not including the time to draft this essay.

What's the moral?  You might think that the moral would be another
rant about the state of our Web site.  But that's not what I intend as
the moral.  The moral is that my personality is such that (a) I tend to
do side explorations in the middle of any task; (b) I find ways to break
things; (c) I take the time to notify people when things are broken; and
(d) sometimes I'm too damn finicky.  All these things make me slower at
the tasks I undertake.  WIll I change?  Probably not.

* Issue: What did we agree on for split leaves?
* Look on GrinCo.
* Email the person who takes them.
* Discover that they are on P'Web.
* Followup note: Why aren't there separate minutes?
* Followup note: What minutes had revisions?
* Check my own notes.
* Followup note to Dean
* Followup note on PDF naming

Yeah, I definitely won't change.

[3] Yes, I regularly donate to Grinnell.  I donate to my department, to the
Grinnell Science Project, to studio art, to the writing lab, to swimming
and diving, and sometimes even to the general fund.  I would encourage you
to donate to Grinnell, too.  If you choose to make targeted donations,
please include a note that *This gift is to be used as the department
sees fit.  In particular, the department should not be required to use
this gift within a particular time period.*  See my forthcoming essay
entitled [Donating to Grinnell](donating-to-grinnell.html) for more
details.

[4] That means that Google now knows that I donate, or at least think about
donating.  I should probably be more cautious about what I search for.
Oh well, it's better than "More evil than Satan" (or the typo of "More
evil than Stan") [5].

moments](embarrassing-teaching-moments.html)

[6] Grinnell's Liberal Arts in Prison Program is wonderful.  You should
consider donating.  Maybe that will be my next donation.

[7] "Yeah, no", as my students say.

[8] Why are you reading this footnote?  I've already said that
I'll talk about that in the forthcoming essay entitled [Donating to
Grinnell](donating-to-grinnell.html).

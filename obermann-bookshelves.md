My bookshelves at the Obermann center
=====================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), rambly*

When [I started my Fellowship at the Obermann Center](obermann-day-one),
one of the first things I said to myself was "I can't deal with empty
bookshelves, I'll need to bring some books. [1]"  I gathered those
books in a bit of an ad-hoc fashion.  If I recall correctly, I did a
five-minute environmental scan of my Grinnell office and grabbed things
of possible interest.  Afterwards, when I saw a book that seems relevant,
I brought it along.

As I reflect upon why I chose books, the books seemed intended to serve
a variety of purposes.  I chose some for *reference; when I wanted
to think about an issue, I'd have it there at hand.  I chose some for
*inspiration*; I hoped to sit down and read them in one of the sunny
nooks at the center [2].  I realize that I chose some as *totems*; they
represent issues I needed to think about and having them on my shelves
was to remind me of those issues.  And I chose a few because I anticipated
that they would eventually be *subjects of musings*.

In any case, here's the current state of my shelves when I sketched this
musing in the middle of September.  Since then, I've added, borrowed, 
and shuffled books [3].  But it seems sufficiently representative for
the purposes of this musing.

Let's see what's there.

Gurton, Sharon R. (Ed.)  1981.  _Contemporary Literary Criticism, Volume
17: Excerpts from Criticism of the Works of Today's Novelists, Poets,
Playwrights, Short Story Writers, Filmmakers, and Other Creative Writers_.
Detroit, Michigan: Gale Research Company.

> I picked up based on [an earlier musing](meanderings-2017-07-22) in
which I expressed interest in seeing what M. Mark wrote about Bruce
Springsteen.  But this volume is filled with comments on musicians:
I see not only Springsteen, but also Chuck Berry, Bob Marley, and Joan
Armatrading.  Comics also seem to be a topic, or at least I see coverage
of Stan Lee and Robert Crumb.  There's even a section for Raoul Duke
[4].  While my original plan had been to reflect on the M. Mark piece,
I also see value in reflecting on the whole volume.

> Unfortunately, I did not manage to muse about this topic this semester.
But it's on my long-term list of books to muse about.

Lombardi, Marilyn May (Ed.).  1993.  _Elizabeth Bishop: The Geography
of Gender_.  Charlottesville, VA: University Press of Virginia.

> One of the running elements of Erik Simpson's [_Lighting the
Page_](http://www.math.grinnell.edu/~simpsone/Connections/Digital/index.html)
was Bishop's poem [One
Art](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47536/one-art).  I recall
being frustrated that the source we used gave no evidence of the original
place of publication.  Later, I was surprised to learn that the poem
had a different meaning than I'd originally attached to it.  In any
case, this volume contains Brett Candlish Millier's "Elusive Mastery:
The Drafts of Elizabeth Bishop's 'One Art'", which I want to read.
Will that become a musing?  I'm not yet sure.

Google.  n.d.  Blank Book.  

> The notebook I'm using for some of my work on the digital humanities
project.  Perhaps I should use a different "bibliography entry" that
mentions myself.  But to the outside observer, that's what it looks like.

Gidal, Eric.  2015.  _Ossianic Unconformities: Bardic Poetry in the
Industrial Age_.  Charlottesville, VA: University of Virginia Press [6].

> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossian) tells us that

> > Ossian is the narrator and purported author of a cycle of epic poems published by the Scottish poet James Macpherson from 1760.

> If I recall correctly, Gidal's book is not just about Macpherson, but
about a century-later attempt to prove that Macpherson actually used
ancient sources, rather than inventing them himself.  It's a really
interesting topic.  The book also explores issues of nature and the
representation of nature in literature.  It's an interesting topic.  Plus,
Eric is a fellow Fellow [7].

I just download it from somewhere?

Di Leo, Jeffrey (Ed.).  2004.  _On Anthologies: Politics and Pedagogy_.
Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.

> I picked this book up after reading [an article about
the challenges of creating an anthology of Gene Kelly
interviews](rhetorical-gestures-kelly-tolkien) to read an article by
Cary Nelson.  The article was definitely worth reading.  Now it sits on
my shelf to remind me to muse about the topic.

Montfort, Nick.  2016.  _Exploratory Programming for the Arts and
Humanities_.  Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.

> I had intended to use this book to expand how I thought about approaching
the topics of the class.  But too much of it seemed like a straightforward
introduction to programming when I glanced through it.  Still, it sits on
my shelf just in case.

Noble, Safiya Umoja.  2018. _Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines
Reinforce Racism.  New York: New York University Press.

> A powerful challenge to how we view algorithms.  One of the first things
I took from the book was the example of Google autocomplete and whether
"fills in the most popular next word" is the appropriate goal, particularly
when the search term is something like "Women should not".

SjÃ³n. 2018.  _Codex 1962: A Trilogy_.  Translated from the Icelandic by

> I need some fiction around.  However, I can't quite remember why I chose 
this particular work.

Schumacher, Julie.  2018.  [_The Shakespeare Requirement_](shakespeare-requirement).  New York, Doubleday.

> Schumacher's _Dear Committee Members_ had me in stitches.  Hence,
when I saw this at [Prairie Lights](https://www.prairielights.com/)
the day after a signing, I picked it up.  I'm not sure why I left it at
Obermann, rather than bringing it home.

Ahmed, Sara.  2017.  _Living a Feminist Life_.  Durham, NC: Duke University

> From a workshop I could not attend.  It's remains important that
I read it.

Felleisen, Matthias, Findler, Robert Bruce, Flatt, Matthew, and
Krishnamurthi, Shriram.  2001.  _How to Design Programs: An Introduction
to Programming and Computing_.

> One of the best introductory textbooks around.  I'm not sure why I
have the first edition, though.  Maybe I'll just rely on [the online
second edition](https://htdp.org/).  I've heard talk of a draft third
edition, but there's just [a small placeholder](http://felleisen.org/matthias/HtDP3e/index.html) on Matthias' Web site.

> I did pick up the second edition later in the semester.  It's sitting
by my desk at home.

Kirschenbaumm, Matthew G.  2016.  _Track Changes: A Literary History
of Word Processing_.   Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard

> This book has been on my "to read" list for two summers.  It is not
directly relevant to the class, but it's likely useful to think about.

Ullman, Ellen.  2017.  _Life in Code: A Personal History of Technology_.

> Another in the category of "not quite relevant, but on my long-term
reading list".

Whitehead, Albert North.  1967.  _The Aims of Education and Other
Essays_.  New York: The Free Press.

> I grabbed this one in my first "I need to stock my shelves" expedition.
My rationale was that I should, on occasion, read classic texts on education.
Was this a good choice?  I never read it, so I'm not sure.

Monmonier, Mark.  1996.  _How to Lie With Maps_, Second edition.

> I have no idea why I brought this book.  Maybe it was to get me to think
more broadly about digital humanities work.  Did someone recommend it?
I forget.  I see that there's now a third edition, but I'll probably stick
with the second for the time being.

Blatt, Ben.  2017.  _Nabokov's Favorite Word is Mauve: What the

for comparatively straightforward approaches to using computers to analyze
texts and therefore ideas for the course.

Williams, Joseph M.  1990.  _Style: Toward Clarity and Grace_.  Chicago, IL:
The University of Chicago Press.

> I've written about this text before.  I'd intended to use it to get
back into "editor" mode and to help myself write better.  It's also on
my list of books to muse about.  But I struggled enough with writing that
I never got into editing mode.

> This book also serves as a totem, of sorts.

> At times, I need to step back and think more broadly about pedagogical
approaches.  This book came recommended to me some years ago, but I
haven't cracked it yet.

hooks, bell.  1995.  _Art on My Mind: visual politics_.  New York:
The New Press.

> Just something to get me to think more broadly.  And, amazingly,
it's likely it will.  When sketching this piece, I opened to the section
entitled "Workers for Artistic Freedom" and found the following.

> > In a democratic society art should be the location where everyone
can witness the joy, pleasure, and power that emerges when there is 
freedom of expression, even when a work created evokes pain, outrage,
sorrow, or shame.  

That's the last book on my shelves.  That also seems to be a good
place to end.

---

[1] At least that's what I remembered.  Now that I check what I wrote
that day, I see that it was "The bookshelves are also way too empty.
I'll need to bring some books here."

[2] When I sketched this musing in mid-September, I said "I'll need to
do some of that before the temperature gets much colder."  I failed.

[3] I'd anticipated posting some subsequent musings about new books.
Because I never finished this musing, those didn't happen either.

[4] Admittedly, the entry for Raoul Duke redirects to the section on 
Hunter S. Thompson [5].

[5] The entry for Sebastian Owl also redirects to Hunter S. Thompson.

[6] I wonder when it went from being the University Press of Virginia
to the University of Virginia Press

[7] I had intended to ask Eric to sign it.  But I didn't want to do
until I read a significant amount and, well, you know the rest.

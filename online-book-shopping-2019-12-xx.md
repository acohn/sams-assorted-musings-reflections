For nearly as long as I can remember, I've enjoyed shopping for
used books.  In my pre-college years, I spent endless hours browsing
used bookstores in Harvard Square and elsewhere.  In college, I
spent a lot of time in Powell's.  I also benefitted from living
less than a block away, which meant that I passed their free book
box on my way to and from classes.

These days, I do much of my used book shopping on the InterWeb.  That's
changed the experience a lot.  It's much easier to find books than it
used to be.  I remember the pleasure at finding a Pogo book that I 
did not own [1]; these days, almost any book I want is available 
immediately, as long as I'm willing to pay the price [2].

[1] I also remember a long argument with a bookseller that there was,
in fact, a Walt Kelly book entitled _Deck Us All With Boston Charlie_.
I see that that AbeBooks has twenty-one copies, although that includes
the reprint from 1994.

[2] That's not completely true.  Some of the Gus Arriola _Gordo_ books
are not available.  At least I can't find a copy of _Gordo's Pets_ [3]
and the only copy of _Bug Rogers_ I can find is a signed edition at
$100 [4].

[3] Not the same as _Gordo's Cat_ or _Gordo's Animals_.

[4] No, it's not worth even close to that much to me.

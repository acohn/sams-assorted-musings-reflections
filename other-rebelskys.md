The other Rebelskys
===================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

For most of my life, I thought we were the only Rebelskys.  Our name
had started out as "Novagrebelsky" but became "Rebelsky" upon arrival
at Ellis island.  (I'm told that the other side of the family was
"Gildenpfennig" and they were given the option of "Gould" or "Gold".
They said "The first one.)  The other US relatives had changed their
name from Rebelsky to fit in better.  Then came the Interweb and Iowa.
I'm friends with a Leon Rebelsky on Facebook who I think has no connection
to me.  And there are other Rebelskys in Iowa.  But, well, I'm almost
certain that they're not related.  My great grandfather was from Russia.
The Iowa Rebelskys came from Germany in the mid 1800's.

Faculty contracts
=================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia)*

When I received my first contract from Grinnell, I was surprised at how
concise it was.  As I recall, it was a more legalistic version of

> We'll pay you [this much] to be an assistant professor of Computer
Science; see the Faculty Handbook and the Trustee bylaws for more
details.

I recall the Dean's assistant telling me that I was the first person
she encountered who asked for the _Handbook_ and the _Bylaws_ before
signing their contract [1].  But I read through the _Handbook_, using
my limited experience to parse the positives and negatives.  Among
other things, I recall being impressed by how thoroughly the _Handbook_
addressed shared positions.  Ever since, I've tried to pay close attention
to the _Handbook_, since I care about what my contract says.

At a recent faculty meeting, we were discussing some proposed changes to
the _Faculty Handbook_ [2].  During the discussion, someone suggested that
the _Faculty Handbook_ is not a contract.  I was surprised to hear that,
because I'd recalled signing documents that said otherwise, so I went
to look.  And I found that the foreword to the _Handbook_ does include
the following paragraph.

> The Faculty Handbook, while dealing with employment policies and
procedures, is not intended to provide any assurance of continued
employment and should in no way be construed as an employment
contract. [3]

I guess the speaker was right.  But I wanted to check my memory, so I
found my contracts with the College [4].  The two that I have are nearly
identical and are close to what I recalled.  That is, they are short
and they point to the _Handbook_.  Here are the details.

> This Contract is by and between _The Trustees of Grinnell College_,
hereinafter referred to as the college, and Samuel Rebelsky, hereinafter
referred to as a faculty member.

> [Details on term, salary, number of payments per year, rank, department,
and length of contract.]

> Special Conditions: Fringe benefits as eligible.

> The rules and regulations concerning the Faculty as set out in the
Bylaws of the Trustees and the Faculty Handbook are hereby referred
to and by reference are made a part hereof.  If you wish to accept
this appointment, please sign your name in the indicated place on
each of the two copies, and return the original at once, retaining
this copy for your own records.  The receipt of this acceptance is
essential to the validity of this contract.  [5]

Now I'm confused.  The contract I signed, such as it is, says that
the _Faculty Handbook_ is part of my contract.  The _Faculty Handbook_
says that it is not a contract.  The combination feels like a logic
puzzle.  My one solution is to interpret the Handbook as saying
that it is not a contract by itself, which suggests that it could
still be a contract when incorporated into another document.  However,
I am not a lawyer.

At least the Dean and President said that they would look into the
issue [6].

I wonder what other institutions do.

Postscript: I was a bit worried when I realized that the most recent
contract I signed with the College may have been when I was still
an assistant professor.  But then I remembered that both of my
promotion letters indicated that I had the rights and responsibilities
of a tenured faculty member, and those letters thereby ensure my
continued employment.

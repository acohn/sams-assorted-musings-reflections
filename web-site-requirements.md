Requirements for the Web site (a note for the Web governance committee)
=======================================================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), long*

As you may recall, I spend way too much of my time frustrated by the
damage that Communications did to our Web site about five years ago.
(add story) This year, the College finally re-formed the Web governance
committee.  Of course, they didn't meet much and when they did meet,
they scheduled meetings at times that the Faculty reps couldn't make.
But they are still trying to make progress.  Recently, someone asked
me what I'd like to see in terms of campus Web resources.  This musing
represents my attempt to think through that question in more depth.

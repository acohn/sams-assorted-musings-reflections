Many pedagogical practices characterize a Grinnell CS education:
An emphasis on active learning, a multi-language/multi-paradigm
introductory sequence, a concern for the ethical implications of
computing, a curriculum that mixes significant theoretical components
(through an upper-level algorithms course and a course in automata,
formal languages, and computational complexity) with hands-on
practice,

To the Racket Users Group

Dear Racket Community,

I'm writing for advice/assistance in dealing with remote teaching and DrRacket.  We traditionally have students in our introductory course work in pairs.  In research studies (not conducted at Grinnell), pair programming suggests many pedagogical benefits: Hanks et al. (2004), in reporting on prior work note that "compared to students who work alone, students who pair have shown increased confidence in their work, greater success in CS1, and greater retention in computer-related majors".  In our own experience, pair programming also helps build a community in the department and a respect for the different skills students can bring.

With the rapid transition to remote learning, we've mostly given up on pair programming in that course.  However, given that our new summer course will be online and that some of our fall courses may be online, we would like to consider how best to maintain the pair experience for our students.  We know that some forms of screen sharing are a possibility, but we'd really prefer an environment in which both members of the pair can use the keyboard and mouse.  And we'd like to

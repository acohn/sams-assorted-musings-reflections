# solidify-musing
#   Fun with Liquid-like prefixes for .md musings.  Reads them from standard
#   input, writes them to standard output

# My assumption is that the input will look something like the following
#
#       ---
#       title: This is the title
#       number: 123
#       tags: autobiographical, short
#       ---
#       Here is the start of my musing.  Isn't that amazing?
#
# The liquid-free versions will look more like
#
#       This is the title
#       =================
#
#       *Topics/tags: [autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*
#
#       Here is the start of the musing.  Isn't that amazing?

# Some fun variables

# Do we start with liquid?

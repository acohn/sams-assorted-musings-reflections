Watching a livestock competition
================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), Iowa, short*

Today I was at the legendary [Iowa State
Fair](https://www.iowastatefair.org/).  I don't go to the State Fair
every year, but each year that I do, I try to focus on something that I
have not done in previous years.  When the kids were young, we used to
go to lots of rides.  There was a period in which they really liked all
the strange sales at the varied industries building [1].  In some years,
we fit in concerts.  More recently, I've been focusing on the Ag building.

This year, I went to my first soapbox [3].  More importantly, I spent some
time watching a 4H heifer competition [4].  A friend had children in the
competition.  We showed up at the fair at 7:30 a.m. to watch.  It turns
out that we didn't need to get there quite that early; their particular
sub-event didn't start until around 9:00 a.m.  But it was useful; I got
to start to start to learn the way these competitions work.  

It's fascinating to see the interaction of the various players,
as it were.  There are the kids and their animals.  There's a judge.
And there are a lot of helpers.  Most of the communication is non-verbal.
There trainers obviously communicate with the cows: a tap or massage
with a stick, a foot in their way.  But I was more interested by the
communication between the human beings.

The judge makes a sign.  It could mean "I'm sorry, you are no longer
in contention".  In that case, the kid brings their animal to the side.
It could mean "I'd like to see the animals walk around."  In that case,
the helpers signal to the kids and the kids start guiding the animals in
a prescribed path.  It could mean "I've reached my decision" [5].  In that
case, everyone cheers and the top competitors rearrange themselves.

The cows don't necessarily like competing.  So the helpers
also help the competitors.  They might tap a cow on the back to get it
moving.  They might just walk alongside.  

And, of course, some have to pick up the manure.

I don't think I'd want to spend all day watching; I don't understand the
subtleties well enough - how each breed is supposed to be shaped; how they
place their feet when they walk; how they carry themselves; and more [6].
But for a few hours, it was definitely a worthwhile experience.  It's
nice to see how a "culture" works and it's intriguing to see how naturally
people carry out their roles.

Congratulations to the young lady who won both Angus and Chianina [7],
if I am not mistaken [8].

Postscript: I realize that, for some of my readers, cattle shows are
part of everyday life.  But they are not part of mine.  Even though
I've lived in Grinnell for twenty years, I'm still a city boy.  And so
I continue to learn interesting (or obvious) things about the world
of farming.

[1] Or perhaps they [2] just liked the free stuff.

[2] Or I.

[3] We saw Tom Steyer.  I hadn't realized it at the time, but I was
standing directly behind his daughter.

[4] At least that's what I think it was.  Livestock are not my expertise.

[5] That one is pretty easy.  He usually holds up one, two, or three
fingers toward a particular competitor.

[6] I heard the judge comment on all of these as  he explained his
decisions.

[7] The award goes to the trainer, not the cow.

[8] I don't have my program.  Her name was Sara something.  I only saw her
compete in Angus and Chianina.  She may have won more.

Van Morrison, Live in Boston 1968
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Music](index-mixtapes), the Interweb, short*

Van Morrison's _Astral Weeks_ is one of my favorite albums.  I don't think
I could explain why, I'm not sure that I could give a coherent answer, or
at least not a sufficiently articulate answer.  I love the instrumentation
and the way the players interact; it's not quite folk, not quite rock,
not quite jazz.  I love how Richard Davis's bass underpins everything.
And Van's voice is also such an amazing instrument.  I like the way he
worries words and phrases in "Madame George", turning some from words
into sounds [1]:

> say goodbye ... goodbye ... goodbye

> dry your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye your eye

> and the love that loves the love that loves the love that loves to love
  the love to love the love [2]
  
Given my enthusiasm for the album, I was thrilled to hear that [someone
recently released Peter Wolf's tape of Van live with a bassist and
flautist from a few months before _Astral Weeks_ was released](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2018/11/08/how-you-can-now-listen-never-before-heard-van-morrison-recording-from-boston/JUjMib9i9GGukHrPYcIjDI/story.html).
The article suggested that it's only available in the UK.  But that's
okay; I know someone in the UK who would be happy to get it for me.

But it's not to be.  It appears that [the album was pulled the day after
it was released](http://ultimateclassicrock.com/van-morrison-catacombs/).
So I'm now left to wonder whether (a) it was a bootleg that the Van
Morrison camp caught and asked Apple to remove, (b) it was a copyright
protection move, which some suggest, or (c) it's just Van being Van.

I figure I'll get to hear it someday.  I assume it will show up
on YouTube or somewhere similar.  Perhaps I'll even get a chance to
purchase it legally and to support an artist I admire.  But for now,
I just feel frustrated.

Postscript: That reminds me: I should probably make a Van Morrison
mixtape for my kids.  Unfortunately, I don't currently have time or
energy to make mixtapes.

Postscript for JonS: Yes, I've picked up Ryan Walsh's _Astral Weeks:
A Secret History of 1968_.  It's now on my to-read list.

[1] I've listened to the earlier version that he recorded for Bang
records.  It has some repetition, but it's not nearly the same song.

[2] There's more, but Sam got lost in the love.

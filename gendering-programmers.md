Critiquing a comment without critiquing the speaker
===================================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), short*

For the past two days, I've been at the Grinnell/UIowa "Digital Bridges"
conference.  Throughout a really good talk on the digital humanities, the
speaker kept referring to programmers as "he" [1].  I didn't think it was
a conscious choice, but it bothered me.  And so I started asking myself,

> How do I politely say "By using male pronouns for programmers, you
normalize gender expectations that I strive to disrupt"?

Or

> How do I critique the comment without critiquing the speaker?

Or

> How do I avoid the Grinnell smackdown?

I was already planning to put on my curmudgeon hat for [my talk about
the new CSC 151](digital-bridges-talk-2018) [2].  But there's a limit to
how many curmudgeonly comments I should make.  Although our commitment to
diversity was a central part of the talk, I didn't consider it appropriate
to add a blunt comment like the following.

> I ask your support in our attempts to diversify computing.  When you
refer to programmers, please do not gender them as male.  Rather, use
"she" or "they".

I didn't have a lot of time to reflect on the matter.  All of the talks
were interesting and I wanted to pay attention.  So I figured that I would
let it pass.

Then came my time to talk.  I was reminded that I can't follow a scripted
speech [3].  And, somewhere in my talk, I started to refer to programmers.
I said something like,

> When you talk to your programmer and *she* goes on to implement a solution ...

That seems like it was the best way to make my point.  I'm not sure whether
or not I was successful.

Postscript: Does posting this musing undermine my efforts?  I wonder.

[1] "You go to the programmer and he ..."

[2] In case you couldn't tell, I dislike suggestions that we replace
"foreign language" requirements with computer science (or computer
programming) requirements.

[3] More precisely, I can't follow a planned speech that's on the screen
of my laptop.  I do much better with paper.

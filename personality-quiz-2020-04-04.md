Recently, the Plans community has been taking and reporting on a
new personality survey, an alternative to the Myers-Briggs and the
ilk [1].  According to the designers, [the
survey](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/) "will
determine your similarity with a long list of fictional characters".
I don't recall the results from the first survey.  In part, it's
that I'm woefully under-informed about modern popular culture; I've
even forgotten much of the popular culture that used to be meaningful
to may, such as the _Lord of the Rings Trilogy_.  In part, it's
that I was more interested in my responses to the survey and, in
trying to remember them [2], I forgot the results.

Since I've forgotten my responses and the results, it seems only
appropriate that I take it again and report what I discover.  I 
will likely skip some questions in describing the process but will
do my best to document my results.

Here goes.

Am I more *normal* or *weird*?  That's an easy one.  I may be a
white-presenting, cisgender, heterosexual male, but I'm not particularly
macho, read more than the average person, write more than the average
person, take joy in strange jokes and rusty metal, and, well, think
and act outside the box.  We'll go with "fairly weird" [3].

Am I more *spiritual* or *skeptical*?  Skeptical of what?  I'm
skeptical of the president.  I'm skeptical of Fox news.  I'm skeptical
of the claims of most software companies.  But I don't think that's
what the survey designers mean.  I pray to a higher power, but I
don't get the same level of comfort from that my power that my truly
spiritual friends get.  Let's push me slightly to the spiritual
side.

Am I more *artistic* or *scientific*?  That's easy [4].

Am I more *cheery* or *sorrowful*?  I take joy in a great many things.
And I'm fat.  Fat men are cheery, right?

Am I *playful* or *serious*?  It depends on the context.  And I believe
in serious play.  But I expect that most who know me would call me
playful.

Am I *fast* or *slow*?  I type fast but move slowly.  And, wow, those
terms have so many other loaded meanings.  I'm going with a bit on the
slow side.

Am I *creative* or *conventional*?  Can't you be both?  And how does this
differ from *normal* vs. *weird*?  We'll go with "highly creative".

Am I more *charming* or *awkward*?  For anyone who has watched me
attempt social conversation that is not about my kids or my work,
that's an easy one.

Am I more *orderly* or *chaotic*?  Stop laughing.  That's harder than
you'd think.  While the world I create around myself is the epitome of
chaos, I also strive to organize myself in many ways.  I enjoy organization,
I just don't have time for it.

Am I more *arcane* or *mainstream*?  I'm confuzzled.  Haven't I answered
a similar question twice before?  Are they looking for validation?

Am I more *blue-collar* or *ivory-tower*?  Well, I work in the equivalent
of an ivory-tower, at least when I'm not sheltering at home, so this one
seems obvious.

Am I more *refined* or *rugged*?  How do I say "neither"?  I'm leaving
this one right in the middle.

Am I more *loyal* or *traitorous*?  I'm not telling.

Am I more *strict* or *lenient*?  Anyone who has recently asked me
for an extension knows the answer to this one.

Am I more *indulgent* or *sober*?  Once again, these don't seem to be
the ends of a spectrum to me.  But at least it's not another variant
of the normal/weird spectrum.  I indulge myself.  I've been known to
indulge my children.  I sometimes indulge my students.  But I rarely
drink a lot.  Let's go with more indulgent than sober.

Am I more *masculine* or *feminine*?  I self-identify as a cisgender
heterosexual male.  But I've been known to show traits that others
identify as feminine.  I care about those around me.  I believe in
communal projects.  I even cry at sad movies.

Am I more *brave* or *careful*?  Another strange dichotomy.  I'd
compare *careless* and *careful*.  I don't feel particularly brave.
I speak out in faculty meetings, but that's a relatively low-risk
activity.  Let's tilt toward careful.

Am I more *ludicrous* or *sensible*?  Isn't it often sensible to be
ludicrous?  How else does one approach the ludicrous state of the
world without adopting some of that state?

Am I more of a *Luddite* or a *technophile*?  Believe it or not,
but it's hard to say.  I teach technology, but that doesn't mean
that I'm someone who always uses the latest technology.  I also
teach people to be suspicious of technology.  I'd put
myself a bit more on the Luddite side, but just a bit.

Am I more *modest* or *flamboyant*?  Perhaps because I know some
very flamboyant people, it's hard to call myself flamboyant.  However,
it's hard to call myself modest.  I'm proud of my accomplishments.
I speak highly of them.  And I certainly present myself in some
flamboyant ways, whether it be my "elderly professor" look or my new
shaved head.

Am I more *frugal* or *lavish*?  I try to be responsible with money, but
I also spend relatively lavishly on some things.

Am I more *intellectual* or *physical*?  I like making things by hand, but
my intellect is core to my personality.  Let's put me far on the 
intellectual side.

Am I more *trusting* or *suspicious*?  It depends on who you compare
me to.  I'm much less trusting than my mother, so if I use her as
the norm, I'd say "suspicious".  I'm much more trusting than my
mother-in-law. Were I to comparemyself ot her, I'd have say "trusting".
In general, I tend to expect the best of people, so taht guides my answer.

Am I more *tense* or *relaxed*?  That's easy.

Am I more *angelic* or *demonic*?  I do a lot of nice things, or at least
I try to do a lot of nice things.  I'm a harsh grader (that's nice,
right?).  I care about my students, my family, the people around me.
But I indulge in the sin of gluttony.  Let's say 75% angelic and 25%
demonic.

Am I more *wise* or *foolish*?  Can't I just check *sophomoric*?  I'm
both.  Or perhaps neither.  I'm going to assume I've learned something
in my fifty-five years and suggest that I'm more on the wise side [5].

Am I more *dominant* or *submissive*?  In professional situations,
I tend to take the lead.  I'm going with "dominant", although not
completely.

Am I more *ferocious* or more of a *pacifist*?  Where does *wimp* fall
on this scale?  I think of real pacifists as being ferociously pacifistic.
But I prefer peaceful resolutions to conflict, so we'll put me on the
pacifist side.

Ooh! Time for the optional survey.  Unfortunately, I don't know much
about any of the shows they've chosen.  I've not watched *Lost* or
*Crazy Rich Asians* or *Silicon Valley* [6] or *Cowboy Bebop* or
*Downton Abbey* or *Parks and Recreation* or *Stargate SG-1* or
*The Wire* or *Mean Girls* or *Game of Thrones*.  I haven't watched
*Twin Peaks* since grad school.  It's been nearly as long since I've
watched *Law & Order: SVU*, *Jurassic Park*, *The Simpsons*, or
*Pirates of the Caribbean*.  I guess I can try *Marvel Cinematic
Universe*.  I think I've watched most of the movies once.

Is *Gamora* more politically correct or edgy?  Is that a real
dichotomy?  Don't know, skip.

Is *Tony Stark* more remote or involved?  I'm going with 75% remote.
I should probably have chosen a larger number.

Is *Loki* more resigned or resistant?  Resistant.  Certainly.

Is *Peggy Carter* more focused on the present or the future?  I have no
idea.

Is the *Black Panther* more permanent or transient?  I'm not even sure
what they intend by those terms.  I am clearly not a helpful participant.

Is *Thanos* more modest or flamboyant?  I expect that he'd call himself
modest, but I"m going with the other one.

Is *Tony Stark* more loyal or traitorous?    Isn't loyalty a key aspect
of the avengers?

Is *Clint Barton* more self-conscious or self-assured?  The latter.

Is *Bruce Banner* more happy or sad?  Angry.

Okay, I'm sick of recording my answers.  Sorry.  Some of the 
dichotomies remain strange.  Awkward vs. Suspicious?  Really?
Jealous or Compersive?  What does "compersive" even mean?

My results say that I my closest match is Craig Pelton of
_Community_.  I have no idea what that means.  I've never seen
_Community_.  We match at 81%.  Next up is Fogell (McLovin) from
_Superbad_.  I also have no idea what that means.  We also match at 81%.
Next up is Andy Bernard from _The Office_ at 80%.  Another show I haven't
watched [7].  At number four we have _Raj Koothrappali_ at 80%.  Finally,
one I know!  I'd swear that I was closer to Leonard.  Certainly,
Michelle claims that I'm most like him.  (Or perhaps it's that she
thinks our mothers are similar.)  But we only have a 63% match.  It
doesn't help that I'm more of an alpha personality and that I consider
myself much more artistic than scientific [8].

Here are the top thirty matches.

1. Craig Pelton (Community): 81%
1. Fogell (McLovin) (Superbad): 81%
1. Andy Bernard (The Office): 80%
1. Raj Koothrappali (The Big Bang Theory): 80%
1. Damian Leigh (Mean Girls): 80%
1. Luna Lovegood (Harry Potter): 79%
1. Michael Scott (The Office): 79%
1. Paul Kinsey (Mad Men): 78%
1. Fez (That 70's Show): 77%
1. Horace Slughorn (Harry Potter): 76%
1. Stan Rizzo (Mad Men): 75%
1. Goh Peik Lin (Crazy Rich Asians): 75%
1. Phoebe Buffay (Friends): 74%
1. Charlie Pace (LOST): 74%
1. Howard Wolowitz (The Big Bang Theory): 74%
1. Ian Duncan (Community): 74%
1. Timon (The Lion King): 74%
1. June George (Mean Girls): 74%
1. Hugo 'Hurley' Reyes (LOST): 73%
1. Moaning Myrtle (Harry Potter): 72%
1. Nymphadora Tonks (Harry Potter): 72%
1. Carrie Bradshaw (Sex and the City): 72%
1. Vince Masuka (Dexter): 72%
1. Bert Cooper (Mad Men): 72%
1. John Hammond (Jurassic Park): 72%
1. Albus Dumbledore (Harry Potter): 71%
1. Aang (Avatar: The Last Airbender): 71%
1. Tom Haverford (Park and Recreation): 71%
1. Effie Trinket (The Hunger Games): 71%
1. Willow Rosenberg (Buffy the Vampire Slayer): 71%

I had to go to thirty to get to someone from _Buffy_.  I'll accept
Willow as a close-enough match from that show.  It's been a decade
or so since I watched it last, so it's hard to think of who might be
a better match.

Wasn't that fun?

[1] Yes, "ilk" is a word.  I have not misspelled "milk".

[2] And failing.

[3] I am not documenting exact numbers.

[4] We'll leave it to the reader to decide what the "easy" decision is.

[5] Certainly, a bunch of people call me a "wise ass".

[6] Well, I've watched a few episodes, but not enough to know it well.

[7] Did I mention that I am clueless about popular media?

[8] That's the answer to the earlier question.

An introduction to SamR's Assorted Musings and Rants
====================================================

_Topics/tags: [writing](index-writing), meta, rambly_

It appears that I have some new readers.  And it's pretty clear that even
some of my old readers want to know more about "SamR's Assorted Musings
and Rants".  So I've decided to write a new introduction.  Here goes!

---

Hi.  I'm Samuel A. Rebelsky (more typically, "Sam" and "SamR").
I teach Computer Science [1] at [Grinnell College](index-grinnell),
a small and excellent liberal arts college in the middle of Iowa
[5].  I've been there more than twenty years and I'm old enough and
care enough that I sometimes identify as a curmudgeon.  A [few years
ago](second-anniversary) [6], I decided to take some of the things that I
was writing as part of my professional life, gather them, and post them
to a public Web site [7].  At some point, I decided to post something
new every day, even if it I was writing something that wasn't something
that I needed to write as part of my professional life.

These days, I write about a variety of topics, most of which are tied to
my academic life or my personal life.  Different readers (or different
groups of readers) appear to appreciate different kinds of writing.  Let's
see ... I [rant](index-rants) about many issues, from campus policies to
broader issues about software and non-inclusive practices.  I regularly
reflect on the [experience and practice of teaching](index-teaching),
particularly teaching computer science.  Those reflections include
drafts of teaching materials and comments on assessment practices.
I write regularly about [people I know](index-grinnellians).  Once a
month I write meta-musings about [the experience of writing daily]
(index-on-writing).  I tend to overcommit, so I sometimes [whine
about my workload](index-overcommitment).  You'll find the occasional
[autobiographical note](index-autobiographical), most typically on days
in which I'm just trying to write something.  I also write regularly
about academic life.  Although I lean left, my writing is generally
not political.

You'll find that these musings, as I call them, have some common
characteristics: They are often off the cuff rather than planned; 
many contain bad jokes [8]; most make excessive use of endnotes [9];
many refer to other musings or to common themes, such as my curmudgeonly
personality, my love of computer science and my students (or vice versa),
my writing style and quality, and, of, course, the endnotes and bad jokes.
I generally intend to write about 1000 words, but you'll see regular
exceptions to that length.

Why do I keep writing?  A lot of reasons, primarily that I enjoy it.
Really.  It's something I generally look forward to.  I like getting ideas
down in tangible form [10], turning the jumble of thoughts in my head to
slightly more coherent prose.  I benefit from the thinking that happens
while I muse.  I appreciate being able to reflect on the writing I do.
I revel in making bad jokes, playing with language (once in a while),
and adding endnotes (almost all the time).  Of course, I must admit that
there are a few days in which my primary enjoyment is simply that I have
written something; there's still an odd pleasure to breaking through the
barrier of "It's hard to write today" or "even though I have a list of
a few hundred potential topics, none of them appeals to me".

I also learn by writing.  While I reflect on many of these issues as
part of my everyday life [11], I find that I think very differently
when I have to put words to paper and think about the flow of ideas.
Having a record also lets me go back and edit and refine the ideas.

There are, of course, other reasons.  The musings provide a model for
my students: One can write for fun and one can write to learn, even as
an old professional.  What I write provides some information about the
current me for the future me and for my kids to reflect back on when I'm
no longer around [12].  The musings communicate to non-faculty about what
faculty work life is like (or at least what one faculty member's work life
is like).  Once in a while, a few may even make some people happy.  And,
once in a while, the musings serve as a drafting space for things that
I'm going to write anyway, such as [talks and speeches](index-speeches),
homework assignments, memos to the Dean, and so on and so forth.

There you have it.  The musings are a series of short pieces [14]
written by a curmudgeonly faculty member in CS about whatever he finds
of interest that day.  They may carry the occasional insight.  They may
make you laugh once in a while.  Read them as you will.

I guess I should also include a few tips for new readers.  Let's see.
The [index by number](index-by-number) lists every musing in 
chronological order.  Some folks seem to enjoy skimming the list for
topics that are of interest.  The [index by topic](index-by-topic)
groups them together and adds a one-sentence "blurb" about each topic.
You can also see [separate indices for each topic](index).

You can keep up with the musings through the [RSS Feed](rss.xml),
by following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rebelsky), or by
checking the [front door] daily.  If you have some connection to me
and are not a Grinnell student, you can also friend me on Facebook.

Postscript: Stay tuned.  I expect that in the near future I will
post a list of recommended musings, along with explanations for 
their selection.   I may eventually write a glossary.

[1] And, from time to time, a few other subjects [2].

[2] Let's see ... I've taught Tutorials [3] on hypertext, intellectual
property, and online communities.  I've taught introductory statistics.
I've taught our introductory course in technology studies [4].
I've taught a Studio Art course that used computer code as the medium.
Most recently, I took over two sessions of an English class when a
colleague was unable to be there.

[3] "Tutorial" is Grinnell's small seminar-style class for first-year
students.  Faculty members teach twelve or so students about a topic
while helping them develop the broader skills to succeed in college.

[4] I realize that most people think of computers when they think about
technology, but we cover technologies from stone tools to the present.  

[5] Some might say "the middle of nowhere" or "the middle of flyover"
country.

[6] Some time in April 2016, more or less.

[7] I'll explain more about those at the end of the musing.

[8] Or, more precisely, "dad jokes".

[9] You will discover that I generally avoid endnote 13.  The [software
I wrote for working with the endnotes](joc-linking-endnotes) helps me
remember to skip that "unlucky" endnote.

[10] Are electrons, or whatever is used for this digital work, tangible?
Well, it's close enough.

[11] I sometimes worry that I think and reflect too much.

[12] Yeah, sometimes I'm maudlin.

[14] "essays" seems overstated.

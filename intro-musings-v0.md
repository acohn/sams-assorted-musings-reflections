An introduction to the musings
==============================

_It appears that I have some new readers.  And I've discovered
that even some of my old readers have forgotten the origins of
"SamR's Assorted Musings and Rants".  So I've decided to write a
new introduction.  Here goes!_

Hi.  I'm Samuel A. Rebelsky (also "Sam" and "SamR").  I teach Computer
Science [1] at Grinnell College, a small and highly regarded liberal arts 
college in the middle of Iowa [2].  A few years ago, I decided to take
some of the things that I was writing as part of my professional life,
gather them, and post them to a public Web site [3].
At some point, I decided to post
something new every day, even if it wasn't quite as important.  

These days, you will find that I write about a variety of issues, most
of which are tied to my academic life or my personal life.  Let's see ...
Rants (about ...).  Thoughts on teaching techniques.  Drafts of 
teaching materials (e.g.,
assignments or readings that I write for class).  Profiles of people I 
know (haeven't done an in a while; I need to restart those).  
Meta-writings about the experience of writing these musings.
Whiney messages about my workload.  Autobiographical comments.
Different readers (or different groups of readers) appear to appreciate
different kinds of writing.

You'll find that these musings, as I call them, have some common
characteristics: Off the cuff, bad jokes, strange use of endnotes,
self-referential.  Generally about 1000 words, although you'll see a
few exceptions in either direction.

Why do I keep doing it?  A few reasons ... I learn by writing.  I enjoy
it.  Really.  It's something I generally look forward to doing.  I like
getting ideas down in electrons.  I like thinking while doing it.  I like
turning the jumble of thoughts in my head to slightly more coherent prose.
I like reflecting on the writing I am doing.  I like making bad jokes,
playing with language (once in a while) and playing with footnotes
(almost all the time).  Of course, I must admit that there are a few days
in which my primary enjoyoment is simply that I have written something.)

More reasons.  It provides a model for my students ... one can write
for fun and one can write to learn, (also good to challenge) even as
an old professional.  Provides some information about the current me
for the future me and for my kids.  (Yeah, sometimes I'm maudlin.)
Communicate to non-faculty about what faculty work life is like (or at
least what one faculty member's work life is like).  A few may even make
some people happy.

Who do I expect reads the musings?  I'm not sure.  I know that my wife
reads them every day.  My kids read them from time to time.  There are
colleagues at Grinnell who seem to read them regularly.  There are
CS colleagues at other institutions who seem to read them off and on.
Alums who read them.  Some current students read them.  Staff members read
them (while you are not representative of all faculty (boy, I hope not),
it is still interesting to see a faculty perspective on some issues)
Still, I'm always surprised when someone says that they read the musings.

What kicked off the musings?  That is, what was
I writing that I thought was worth public posting?  A variety of things.
Here are a few that helped kick off the writing.
* Our President had just announced that Grinnell was terminating its
agreement with the Posse foundation.  Like many Grinnellians, I was
frustrated not only by that announcement, but also by the limited view
of Posse that was embedded in the announcement.  I wrote a long piece.
I then learned more about the reasons behind the decision.  I don't
agree with them, but I understood them.  So you can't read that original
rant.  But you can read [an updated version](posse-termination-revisited).
* As chairman of the CS department, I was answering a lot of questions
about [CS at Grinnell](grinnell-cs) and [CS at liberal arts colleges 
in general](lac-vs-university).  Those seemed to be important enough
questions that I thought it useful to post my answers so that I could
refer others to them.
* I also posted [a draft of a thank-you note to donors](donor-thank-you)

And there you have it.  The musings are a series of short pieces [4]
written by a curmudgeonly faculty member in CS about whatever he finds
of interest that day.  They may carry the occasional insight.  They may
make you laugh once in a while.  Read them as you will.

Postscript: Stay tuned.  I expect that in the near future I will
post a list of recommended musings, along with explanations for 
their selection.

[1] And, from time to time, a few other subjects.

[2] Some might say "the middle of nowhere" or "the middle of flyover"
country.

[3] I'll explain more about those at the end of the musing.

[4] "essays" seems overstated.

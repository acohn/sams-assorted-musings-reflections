Depressed and obsessed (or "Putting the marketing campaign behind me")
======================================================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), marketing, short*

The advent of Grinnell's new "[institutional
identity](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/communications/brand/visual-identity)"
and [noun-phrase-centric marketing
campaign](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/offices-services/communications/brand/promise)
have put me in a funk.  I realize that we need to [market
Grinnell](marketing-grinnell).  But I'm bothered by so many things,
including the [awkward noun phrases that seem to be at the center
of the campaign](our-grinnellian-story-2018-05-10), the confusing
change from "individually advised curriculum" to "individually
advised learning" [1], the [sometimes awkward typography and typeface
choices](grinnell-typefaces-2018-05-17), the weird [banners](banners)
on lightpoles around campus, the now-common Communications approach
of "make a big change without first thinking about the consequences"
[2,3], and [the incorrectly colored, fuzzily rendered, and inadequately
cropped logo](bad-logo) that lived on the Web site for a full month
after I first reported it [4].

My frustration with the campaign got so bad that I started dreaming about
it.  In the dreams [5], someone would come up and ask how I was doing.
All I could do was rant about the approach.  It became on obsession,
of sorts.  The campaign also entered my dreams in other ways, too.  For
example, when I was working on my attempts to [match the new 
letterhead](joc-letterhead) [6], I also dreamed a lot about fonts.

Then there are the days that I decided to post pictures of the new
banners and signage to Facebook.  While those posts generated a lot of
fun conversation, they produced no forward motion.

I love Grinnell.  I hate many aspects of the marketing campaign and
worry about what the problems in that campaign suggest about broader
issues at the College: issues of shared governance, transparency,
willingness to consult, attention to detail, love of language, planning.
I'm not thrilled about how the language represents Grinnell.  I also know
that a bad marketing campaign can negatively impact the institution;
I've heard many people credit the undermining of the concept of "self
governance" to the "No Limits" campaign.

But worrying about the campaign harms me [7].  And my complaints won't
make the campaign any better.

It's time to put my obsession behind me.  

I'm going to try to trust that people with authority and sense will
help make sure that we have a sensible campaign.  Things like [the new
admissions site](our-grinnellian-story-2018-05-15) give me hope.

Don't worry, though.  I'll find something new to obsess about.  I'll try
to avoid the next obsession being Communications' failure to live up to
their promises about a general public Web site.

[1] I hear rumors that someone had the bright idea that "Students
now have three advisers.  'Curriculum' suggests only their academic
advisor.  Let's substitute another word."

[2] How can others get access to the fonts?  _They probably can't._  What 
are the policies about other Web sites, such as www.cs.grinnell.edu?  _We
haven't figured that out yet._  I see that we now have new designs in the
stationary store.  We used to have a standard Word document for people who 
needed electronic versions of the letterhead.  Where can I find that? _Since
we use a custom font for the letterhead, we still need to figure that out.
Use the old one for now._  Did anyone on the faculty review the language
of the new campaign?  _Silence_.

[3] I say "now-common" because it's also what they did with the Web
site.  _We're throwing everything off www.grinnell.edu that doesn't
pertain to prospective students._  "Where will it go?"  _We're not sure.
We'll figure it out eventually._  Here it is, four or five years later
and, well, they haven't figured it out yet.  And we're increasingly
[hiding things behind a password wall](public-web-2018-05-18) because
the primary site available for non-marketing purposes is GrinCo, our
Sharepointless site, which is intended only for on-campus-only materials.
Unfortunately, our administration is relatively clueless about the Web
and no one in power is pushing for (or perhaps even understands the need
for) the promised general public site.

[4] It should never have been there in the first place.

[5] Nightmares?

[6] It would be so much nicer if the letterhead were documented somewhere,
preferably with a helpful guide similar to the old [_Graphics Standards
Guidelines_](https://www.grinnell.edu/sites/default/files/documents/GraphicStandardsManual.pdf).

[7] I can tell, for example, by how quickly that prior paragraph grew.

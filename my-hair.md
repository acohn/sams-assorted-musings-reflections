My hair
=======

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short, pointless*

When I was a young adult in college, I decided that I wanted to grow
my hair long.  I had assumed that it would go down my back, like most
people's hair seems to do.  I was wrong.  My hair had enough substance
that it grew out.  I ended up with more of an Isro [1] than flowing locks.
If you've seen Middle Son when he picks his hair, you'll have a hint of
what my hair looked like [2].

Now I'm an old adult [3].  I'd like that hair style back.  But when I
try to grow my hair out, it mimics the old goal, rather than the new
one.  That is, it flows down my back, rather than up in the air.

I've also discovered that it likes to bind together into a mat of sorts.
It does that even when I brush regularly and use conditioner [4].
Recently, while attempting to brush out the knots, Michelle noted that
a likely cause was my tendency to let my hire sit inside my colar when
it's wet.  Who knew [5]?

How long will I let it get?  I'm not sure.  I kind of like the
crazy old hippie professor look.  It goes well with the [coat and
tie](coat-and-tie-2018-05-11).  And it's not like I can easily undo the
change if I cut it significantly.  My hair grows slowly, I'd need to
wait a few years until it was back to this length.

My family has mixed reactions to the concept of cutting.  One son
regularly suggests that I cut my hair and shave my beard [6].  Another
son tells me that he doesn't like change and wants me to keep the long
hair and beard.  The third son doesn't express much of an opinion.
Michelle suggests that if I'm keeping them long, I should get my hair 
and beard trimmed so that they look neater.

[1] The term some use for the hair style that looks like an Afro on
Jewish people.

[2] I never achieved the tight ringlets he has, but I guess I never 
tried.

[3] Well, perhaps a middle-aged adult.

[4] Okay, I don't know whether it does that if I don't brush regularly
or use condition, since I do both.  But I expect things would be worse
otherwise.

[5] Probably every woman and man who has had long hair.

[6] It appears that he forgets what I look like beardless.

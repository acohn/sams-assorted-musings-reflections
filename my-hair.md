My hair
=======

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short, pointless*

When I was a young adult in college, I decided that I wanted to grow
my hair long.  I had assumed that it would go down my back, like most
people's hair seems to do.  I was wrong.  My hair had enough substance
that it grew out and up, rather than down.  I ended up with more of an
Isro [1] than the flowing locks I had hoped for.  If you've seen Middle
Son when he picks his hair, you'll have a hint of what my hair looked like
[2].

Now I'm an old adult [3].  I'd like that hairstyle back.  But when I
try to grow my hair out, I achieve the old goal, rather than the new one.
That is, my hair flows down my back [4], rather than up in the air.

I've also discovered that it likes to bind to itself into a mat of sorts.
It does that even when I brush regularly and use conditioner [5].
Recently, while attempting to brush out the knots, Michelle noted that
a likely cause was my tendency to let my hair sit inside my collar when
it's wet.  Who knew [6]?  Perhaps she's right; I've been a bit more
careful since she told me and it seems to be matting less.

Now that I've solved the matting problem (or at least think I have),
I've encountered a new problem.  When I rolled up the windows in my car
today, I managed to get my hair caught in the window without realizing
that I had.  Opening the door was a surprising experience.

How long will I let it get?  I'm not sure.  I kind of like the
crazy old hippie professor look.  It goes well with the [coat and
tie](coat-and-tie-2018-05-11).  And it's not like I can easily undo the
change if I cut it significantly [7].  My hair grows slowly, I'd need to
wait a few years until it was back to this length again.

The last time I let it grow this long [8], I donated it to
[Pantene](https://pantene.com/en-us/brandexperience/make-the-cut).
I may now have enough grey that that's no longer an option.

My family has mixed reactions to the concept of cutting my hair.
One son regularly suggests that I cut my hair and shave my beard [9].
Another son tells me that he doesn't like change [10] and wants me to
keep the long hair and beard.  The third son doesn't express much of
an opinion.  Michelle suggests that if I'm keeping them long, I should
get my hair and beard trimmed so that they look neater.

You know what?  I probably shouldn't have mused about my hair; the
musing feels as tangled as my hair and, like my hair, doesn't have
a clearly defined end.

[1] "Isro" is the term some use for the hairstyle that looks like an
Afro on Jewish people.

[2] I never achieved the tight ringlets he has, but I guess I never 
tried.

[3] Well, perhaps a middle-aged adult.

[4] Well, over my shoulders.

[5] Okay, I don't know whether it does that if I don't brush regularly
or fail to use conditioner, since I brush and use conditioner.  But I
expect things would be worse otherwise.

[6] Probably every woman and man who has had long hair.

[7] Or, more precisely, have someone else cut it significantly.

[8] Well, not quite this long.

[9] It appears that he forgets what I look like beardless.

[10] Or at least not rapid change.

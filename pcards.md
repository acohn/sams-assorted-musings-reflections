P-Cards (aka Pioneer One-Cards)
===============================

It's graduation weekend.  I wasn't intending to rant.  Rather,
I was intending to write nice things about the graduating seniors
[1].  But then I got a response to my question about data privacy and
the Pioneer One-Card system.  Here's an approximation of the answer:
"It appears that you are correct that we should revisit the issue of
access to Pioneer One-Card data.  However, the P-Card committee is not
the group to do so, since they have no governance or oversight
responsibilities [2].  We will consider these issues as part of our
broader consideration of information security and data governance."

Now, I'm glad that we are beginning a broader consideration of information
security and data governance.  It's about time.  I hope that there is
faculty representation involved.

[1] I'll still write things about them, just not today.

[2] That's news to me.  In the past, they've certainly weighed in on
appropriate and inappropriate uses of P-Card numbers, which strikes me
as an oversight issue.

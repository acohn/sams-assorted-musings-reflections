There's a lot of discussion on the Grinnell Parents and Families
Facebook group about how Grinnell is deciding on the cohorts for
each of the four terms this year.  As you might guess, folks are
unhappy, unhappy not only about the decisions that have been made,
but also the decisions that they think will be made.  I'm also not
sure that there's a consistency of opinion on campus.

I'm not on the committee that is making those decisions.  I've been
at Grinnell long enough that I can probably reflect on how others
might be making decisions. But I think I'd rather reflect on what
decisions I might make.  So let's pretend I was in charge of decisions
[1].

What are my parameters?  Entities with much more power than I have
have already decided that we will  make public health our priority
(it's hard to argue with that decision) and that prioritization
implies that we should start with a cohort of 500 or so students out
of the 1650-or-so students we typically enroll [2].

How might I populate that first cohort of 500?  There are so many
factors at play: fairness, quality of education, safety of the
community, and more.

My first priority would be students who have nowhere else safe to go.
Some of our students have unsafe home situations because of finances
or families.  Some have unsafe situations because of differences between
their identity and their family's expectations for their identity.
I don't know all the reasons, but I know that there are students who
will be much better off at Grinnell.  I know we asked students to note
if they are in these kinds of situations; I hope that our models of 
these kinds of situations and our students' models match.

My second priority would be students who should be on campus for
legal reasons.  I don't know the exact law about these issues, and
my understanding is that guidance is shifting.  Still, I think
it's generally expected that international students in the US who
have F1 visas have to be on campus.

I've heard that those two groups put together include about 150
students.  So we're left with 350 or so slots.

Like those making the decisions, I would prioritize incoming
first-year students [3] for the first term.  Why these students?
In part, it's about forming connections.  It's hard to become part
of the community of a residential college unless you spend some
time on campus.  Second-years, third-years, and seniors have built
friend groups and support groups.  The incoming first-years have
not.  Returning students [4] have learned about the resources on
campus: They know faculty, they know about CLS, they know how to
use the writing lab.  The incoming first-years have not.  I expect
that it's easier to learn the resources and to form community once
you've had some time on campus.

I also feel that there's a bit of fairness at play in prioritizing
first-years.  These students lost the end of their senior years.
Helping them a here makes sense and lets them move forward in an
important way.

While it shouldn't be a primary factor, I expect finances also come
into play.  First-years may choose another institution if Grinnell
decides to make them go online in the fall.  My sense is that most
institutions are prioritizing first-years for that reason.

I'm pretty sure we've now more-or-less filled Fall Term 1.  If we
have any remaining slots, I'd use them for returning students who
had been in positions of dorm leadership, things like house wellness
coordinators and student community assistants [6].  I know the
College has decided not to prioritize those positions, but I see
them playing an important role in helping the first-years acclimate
to Grinnell.  The other kinds of returning students will play some
role, but they are not trained leaders and mentors.

What about Fall Term 2?  One of the first questions is whether we
should keep the students from F1 for F2.  The students on campus
for wellness or legal reasons will likely need to stay.  But what
about the first-years?  Should they stay or should we ask them to
leave to make room for other students?

I can see good reasons for sending most of the first-years home for
F2.  If they stay, they will be stuck in the middle of the corn
fields for about sixteen weeks straight.  That's hard; there's a
reason we have fall break.  I also know that Thanksgiving with
family is particularly important to our first-year students and
their families [7].  And sending them  home gives us more freedom
to give other students a chance of being on campus.

But that's not the choice that the College made.  More precisely,
that's not the choice that those making choices made.  I'm not even
sure who made the decision that first-years would stay for all of
fall.  Was it Curriculum Committee?  Was it a higher-level
administrator?  Was it the legendary (RS)2 [8] committee?

Why would they make this choice?  I expect that it has to do with
the complexities of getting three-hundred-and-fifty students off
campus and however many more students back on campus in a week.
Can we clean out dorm rooms?  Can we do that much testing of people
in such a short time, given that our model requires that students
stay in College-funded hotel rooms while awaiting their first
results?  There's probably some public health rationale at play
here, too.  We "know" that the students on campus are healthy.  The
ones we are adding?  It's much less clear, even with testing.

Let's assume we can add another two-hundred-and-fifty students for
F2.  I've seen a range of numbers.  And it makes sense that there
will be fewer students added than there are already on campus.  So
let's go with 250.  That number is not large.  It means that we
cannot add all the second-years or all the third-years or all the
seniors or all the fall or winter athletes or ....

So we might make a decision to add one incomplete group or more
smaller groups.  What are some possibilities for large groups and
small groups to prioritize?

* We might prioritize *second-year students*.  Why?  There's good
evidence that fall of the second year is the hardest term in most
students' careers.  It's when you move from exploration to settling
down with a major.  (That seems to hold even for students who had
majors before they started college.)  It's when you begin trying
to figure out whether and how you fit in a discipline.  Most
second-years also start to move into leadership positions in their
organizations.  (I've forgotten the rest.) 

* We might prioritize *third-year students*.  Many of them will
be studying abroad in the spring [9], so F2 will be their only
chance to return to campus this year.

* We might prioritize *planned mid-year graduates* because it will
be the last opportunity they have to return to campus as students.

* We might prioritize *other seniors*.  There could be advantages
to having them on campus to start wrapping up their Grinnell careers.
But I assume most would rather be on campus in the spring, to end
their careers here.

* We might prioritize *athletes in Fall or Winter sports*.  That
assumes we plan to hold those sports, which is still up in the air.
As the parent of swimmers and a diver [10], I'd like to see swimming
resume. It even seems like one of the safer sports.  I also know
that our basketball teams build community on campus, although I
must admit that I don't know how much community you can build if
there's no one in the stands.

* We might prioritize *students in classes that benefit from a
significant in-person component or campus resources* and that we
can safely and appropriately run on campus.  Examples include Studio
Art, Music, Lab Sciences, and Theatre and Dance.  Why might we not
be able to safely or appropriately run them on campus?  In Theatre
and Dance, there may be be evidence that exertion in a closed space
increases the chance of transmission.  In Studio Art or Lab Science,
social distancing might mean that we cannot fit enough students in
the studio or lab.

* We might prioritize *students who can mentor the first-years*,
whether they are those dorm assistants I mentioned earlier or
class mentors.  As I noted, having trained mentors and leaders
will contribute to the experiences of the first-year students.

* We might prioritize *some other groups that I have not considered*.
I don't have much to say about that group, other than to note that
it's worthwhile to talk about these issues with others because we
will learn of new ideas and approaches.

The choice is a hard one.  A belief that everyone deserves some
time on campus would lead us to prioritize mid-year graduates and
third-years who are planning to study abroad in the spring.  Focusing
on educational experiences would lead us to prioritize those in
certain kinds of classes.  Acknowledging traditional struggles
students face would lead us to pick second-year students.

I wish we had prioritized student mentors and leaders.  Perhaps we
have.  They could be a comparatively small group.  But I haven't
heard anything about it.  They would also provide an important
resource for second-year students, if we chose to prioritize them.

We're prioritizing second-year students for F2.  I think that's
public knowledge.  At least I hope it's public knowledge.  I guess
it is now.  In any case, I assume we decided to invite second-year
students for the reason I suggested above; we know that second-year
students can struggle with figuring out their identities and we'd
like to provide them with on-campus resources.  It may also be that
we believe that these students will particularly benefit from the
course that rely on on-campus resources.

That may be the right decision.  I'll admit that I would have made
the more emotional decision of bringing back mid-year graduates and
third-year students planning to study abroad in the fall.  I know how
much students love being at Grinnell.  I wouldn't want to deny them
one term on campus this year.  And I worry that second-year students
will also need support in the spring, when they declare majors.  I'd
rather have them on campus then.

Are third-year students screwed by this, as I've heard some parents
suggest?  I feel bad for students who won't get a term on campus
this, year which looks like what will be what happens to third-year
students who are abroad in the spring and to mid-year graduates.  It
might even be what happens to seniors who take the fall off [11].
But I wouldn't say third-years are being ignored, as I've also heard
some people suggest.  

Their experience is certainly much less good than anyone would hope.
But are they being ignored?  I don't think so.  My sense is that
someone did an analysis similar to mine and decided that first-year
students and second-year students should have higher-priority.  As
I note at the end of this musing, I expect people are making plans
for other ways to support third-years.

That's the fall.  Who will we prioritize in spring?  Who should we
prioritize in spring?  I'd start with the same first two groups:
Students who will be much safer on campus and students whose ability
to stay in the US would be affected by whether or not they are on
campus.  I'm not sure if I would continue to prioritize those "leaders
and mentors" groups; it depends on who else will be on campus.

What next?  That's difficult.  I'm going to assume that we plan to
clean out the dorms almost completely, so we don't have the "continue
the cohort from the previous term" issue at play.  But we'll still
have students who need to be on campus for safety or legal reasons.
Beyond those two groups, I see a variety of groups that are important
to have on campus in the spring.  In no particular order, they are,

* First-year students who could not be on campus in the fall.
* Students who enrolled in the fall who did not have a chance to be 
  on campus in the fall.
* Seniors, who should get part of their senior year on campus.
* Athletes, if we've decided to restart competition.  There are also 
  reasons to bring athletes back even if we haven't restarted competition;
  building team cohesion is important.
* Students in classes that benefit from a significant in-person component 
  or campus resources and that we can safely and appropriately run on campus.
  See my earlier note on such class.
* Students doing work that belongs on campus, such as Studio Art students
  doing shows, Theatre and Dance students involved in productions,
  and MAP students.
* Once again, here are probably others who don't immediately come to mind.

Can we have all of those groups safely on campus in the spring?  I have 
no idea.  I'd hope that we could have *all* students safely on campus
in the spring, but that seems unlikely.  If we have most of the fall 
first-year students off campus, a bunch of third-year students abroad,
and a well-functioning system for maintaining campus health, it may be
that the remainder will come close to fitting.

I'm not sure that it's reasonable to make all of the decisions right
now, not least because that public health component will have a
significant impact.  After the default groups, I would start with
the first-years who could not be on campus in the fall (and want
to be on campus in the spring), add enough leadership to support
them, and then move on to seniors.  If I had made the choice to
bring third-years here for Fall 2, I'd also prioritize second-years.
As I said, it's a difficult year for second-years.  Being here for
spring could be the best time to support their identity development.

Once we've chosen cohorts, we may still have to make individual
decisions.  Suppose things take a turn for the worse, that we realize
that we can only have two-hundred students on campus for Spring
Term 2, and that we decide our cohort will include only graduating
seniors. (That's not a likely scenario, but it helps us explore
some individual points.) Should some of those other characteristics
come into play?  For example, should we prioritize senior Studio
Art majors so that they can have an on-campus exhibition?  I'd say
so.  Should we prioritize senior athletes?  If the situation is
such that we have only two-hundred students on campus, we're unlikely
to be participating in competitions, so probably not.  But in other
situations, we might want to do so.

Then there's a hard question that a variety of people are discussing.
What if some of those seniors have taken both fall terms off? [14]
Should that affect whether or not they get invited back if we are
choosing between people in the same cohort (those seniors)?  I can
see one sense of fairness that suggests that all students who
enroll for the full year deserve a chance to be on campus.  It's
hard!

Like other schools, we are trying to make it less hard by adding a
summer term.  Perhaps third-year students [15] can be on campus in
summer.  Perhaps we can allow those students to be on campus without
charging them tuition.  Of course, many will be better served by
being at internships or research experiences at other institutions.
Perhaps we can make MAPs available for many of them, which will be
nearly as good.  And perhaps we will once again acknowledge that
if a student is being paid $3,400 for a MAP [16] and it costs almost
that much to be in Grinnell over the summer [17], we will realize
that it is inappropriate to ask summer MAP students to contribute
from their so-called "summer earnings" [18].

Where am I going with all this?  I'm not sure.  I have concluded
that I would make somewhat different decisions than have been made.
I've seen that there are reasons to make different decisions.  And
I've acknowledged that choosing cohorts for spring will be complex,
which makes it hard to make broad promises right now.

As a parent, I would be frustrated if my student were not prioritized.
As a parent, I am a bit frustrated at the choices my Youngest Son's
institution is making, mostly because of the impact they will have
on him and on us.  But as part of a community, I accept that there
are broader interests at play and I acknowledge the generally good
intent of those making decisions.

I look forward to broader campus conversations about how we will
best support the students who will not be on campus this fall,
particularly the third-years who may not be here at all this year,
the international students who cannot return to this country, the
athletes mourning the loss of their seasons, the seniors who only
get part of their senior year here, and so many others.  We should
address them as a whole, as subgroups, and as individuals.  Maybe
when Tuesday rolls around [18], I'll ask what planning is happening
for those groups and where it is happening

[1] It's probably good that I am not.

[2] Counting numbers of students is hard.  There are different protocols
for different situations.  For example, there are questions of how you
count students on study abroad programs and how you count students on
leave.  I know none of the protocols.

[3] And transfer students.

[4] Since they may not be returning to campus, perhaps we should call
them "re-enrolling students" rather than "returning students" [5].

[5] That may not be the most appropriate joke to make right now.  But
I'm not even sure I intended it as a joke.

[6] The terms we use for these students change over time.  I don't 
remember what the other in-dorm support students are called.  Community
assistants?  Student assistants?

[7] This year will likely be one in which we do not bring students 
into our house.  That makes me sad.  Michelle and I are also moving
on to empty-nester syndrome; I wonder if future years will be where
one of the kids is.

[8] The Recovery, Stewardship, and Renaissance Steering Committee.
I'm still not sure why the "Steering" gets put into the formula.

[9] At least many of them hope to be studying abroad in the spring.
It's hard to tell what the spring will bring.  Will countries open
up?  Will programs in those countries open?  And will those countries
permit folks to come from the US?

[10] They are alumni now, so perhaps "Swammers and a Dover".

[11] Given a choice between a senior or third-year who enrolls for
all four terms and a senior who takes the fall off, who would you
prioritize for spring?  I'm not sure what I'd choose [12].

[12] I like to say that if I had a student in one of those groups,
I'd prioritize that group.  But that's not true.  I'd be thinking
about the broader issues.  And, in any case, I'm not making any of
the decisions.

[14] I originally wrote "fall semester", but that doesn't exist any
more.

[15] Rising seniors.

[16] I think that's the current stipend.

[17] I seem to recall that room and board on campus this summer is
about $3,200.  I seem to recall that the notice about the fees
for room and board suggested that they were similar to living off
campus.  Or maybe that was just room.  Most students can feed themselves
for less than $40 or so per day.

[18] I realize that this issue is one of my "broken record" rants.  But
I find that people forget these issues unless I bring them up regularly.

[19] It's a long holiday weekend.  While some of us will be working on
Monday, I should not assume others will be working and should not barrage
them with questions.

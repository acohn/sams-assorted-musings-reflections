There's a lot of discussion on the Grinnell Parents and Familes Facebook
group about how Grinnell is deciding on the cohorts for each of the four
terms this year.  As you might guess, folks are unhappy not only about 
the decisions that have been made, but also the decisions that they think
will be made.

I'm not on the committee that is making those decisions.  But I've been
at Grinnell long enough that I can probably think about these issues a
bit.

First priority: Students who have nowhere else safe to go.

Next priority: Students who should be on campus for legal reasons.
I don't know the exact law about these issues, and my understanding
is that guideance is shifting, but it's generally expected that
international students in the US who have F1 visas have to be on
campus.

After that, things open up a bit.

Why prioritize First-Year students in the first term?  It's hard to
become part of the community of a residential college unless you 
spend some time on campus.  And, in some sense, there's a bit of
fairness at play here.  Remember that these students lost the
end of their senior years. Helping them a bit here makes sense.

That more-or-less fills Fall Term 1.  A broader decision has been
made to keep the Fall 1 students on campus through Fall 2.  I don't
know that I would have made that decision, but I can understand
some of the rationale.  It certainly

Second years next.  Why?  There's good evidence that fall of the
second year is the hardest term in most students' careers.  It's
when you move from exploration to settling down with a major.  (That
seems to hold even for students who had majors before they started
college.)  It's when you begin trying to figure out wheter and how
you fit in a discipline.  Most second-years also start to move into
leadership positions in their organizations.  (I've forgotten the
rest.)  Would that be enough to make me prioritize them over, say,
athletes in winter sports (I did raise swimmers and divers) or other
categories (see my spring analysis of some other important categories)?  
I'm not sure.  But I can see good reasons for doing so.

What about seniors?  For most seniors, I would think the spring would
be more important than the fall.

Are third-year students screwed by this, as I've heard some people
suggest?  Their experience is certainly much less good than anyone
would hope.  But are they being ignored?  I don't think so.  My
sense is that someone did an analysis similar to mine and decided
that first-year students and second-year students should have
higher-priority.

Who will we prioritize in spring?  Who should we prioritize in spring?
I'd start with the same first two groups: Students who will be much
safer on campus and students whose ability to stay in the US would be
affected by whether or not they are on campus.

What next?  That's difficult.  I see a variety of groups that are
important to have on campus in the spring.  In no particular order,
they are

* First-year students who could not be on campus in the fall.
* Other students who did not have a chance to be on campus in the fall.
* Seniors, who should get part of their senior year on campus.
* Athletes, if we've decided to restart competition (and perhaps even
  if we have not).
* Students in classes that benefit from a significant in-person
  component and that we can safely and appropriately run on campus.
  Examples include Studio Art, Music, Lab Sciences, and Theatre and
  Dance.  Why might we not be able to safely or appropriately run
  them on campus?  In Theatre and Dance, there may be be evidence
  that exertion in a closed space increases the chance of transmission.
  In Studio Art or Lab Science, social distancing might mean that we
  cannot fit enough students in the studio or lab.
* There are probably others that don't immediately come to mind.

Can we have all of those groups safely on campus in the spring?  I have 
no idea.  I'd hope that we could have *all* students safely on campus
in the spring, but that seems unlikely

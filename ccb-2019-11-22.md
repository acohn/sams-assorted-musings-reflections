Cuts, Closes, and Balances in CS for Spring 2020, Revisited
===========================================================

While, for the most part, we are able to get through Cuts, Closes, and Balances in CS relatively smoothly, we did hit one large stumbling block.  It’s a complicated one, and may require some back story.  The basic issue is that under-enrollments (e.g., 15/20) can be as much of a problem as over-enrollments (e.g., 25/20).

That seems counter-intuitive, doesn’t it?  Here’s the thing.  Our curriculum is a finely balanced thing.  We graduate approximately sixty CS majors each year.  With eight regular faculty [1], we can offer three sections of each of our required 300-level courses each year.  That is, we have three sections of CSC 301, Algorithm Analysis (capped at 20), three sections of CSC 341, Automata, Formal Languages, and Computational Complexity (capped at 20), and three sections of CSC 324/326 (capped at 16/6, with an anticipated combined enrollment of 20).  If a class is under-enrolled in one semester, it is likely to be over-enrolled in a future semester.

Now, things aren’t quite that simple.  We encourage our students to study abroad.  Many do.  Some study abroad in locations that allow them to take CS courses.  When possible, we encourage them to take a course equivalent to CSC 341, which seems to be most similar from institution to institution.  We’ve also had some take CSC 301 equivalents abroad, although the content of those courses varies more.  And, once in a while, a student identifies a course that we can consider using as an equivalent to CSC 324.

In addition, “sixty majors each year” is an approximation.  While our enrollments seem to have stabilized at the size, we might have a few more or a few less.  If we have a few more, we might need to over-enroll some courses a bit.  But we want to limit over-enrollments.

So then the question becomes: If we have fourteen open slots in CSC 301 and CSC 341 this semester, what obligation do we have to make sure those slots get filled now so that we don’t have fourteen students we have to find slots for next year?  Or, in colloquial terms, should we just kick the can down the road?

If we want to address the issue, the next question becomes how we address the issue.  We can gently encourage our students to take CSC 301 and CSC 341 this semester.  We can identify students who are able to take the courses this semester, and kick them out of over-enrolled courses.  But if we kick them out, do we kick them out of required courses (which they will have the opportunity to take at another date), or elective courses (which they don’t strictly need to take)?

As I said, it’s a difficult issue.

I share it with you, in part, so that you understand the kinds of stresses faculty (and department chairs) encounter in what one would hope would be a straightforward process.  I have no good solutions.

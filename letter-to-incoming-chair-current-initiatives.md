Current CS initiatives (part of a draft letter to the incoming chair)
============================================================================

_In [my recent end-of-semester debriefing session](reflections-2017-05), I
decided that I should try to have documentation in place for my successor
as chair by early June.  I write enough that I expect it will take me a
dozen or so essays to cover everything.  I've already written [a draft
introduction](letter-to-incoming-chair-intro), [a list of common chair
responsibilities](letter-to-incoming-chair-common-tasks), and [a list of
CS-specific chair responsibilities](letter-to-incoming-chair-cs-tasks).
This musing serves as the third (non-introductory) section of the letter
and covers current initiatives within the department.  I expect I'll
need to write a follow-up musing at some point when I remember other
initiatives._

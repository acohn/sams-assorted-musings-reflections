Surviving week one of code camp
===============================

*Topics/tags: [Code camps](index-code-camps), rambly*

For reasons I'll describe in a separate musing, I've been spending the
last few summers working with groups of students to design and run code
camps for middle-school and late-elementary students.  While I had good
reasons to undertake this endeavor, running code camps and studying the
efficacy of code camp curricula are neither my passion nor my expertise
[1].

Last week, we ran the first of three summer camps for 2018.  The first
camp targeted students going into 4th and 5th grades and focused on
what we call "The Craft of Code".  Our campers wrote programs that
led to some tangible products (3D-printed objects, embroidered cloth)
as well as programs that made artworks.

Running a camp for about thirty nine- and ten-year-olds is a lot
of work.  Our days started before 8:00 a.m. for setup and ended after
6:00 p.m. after cleanup, debriefing, and some additional preparation for
the next day [2].  And the time with the kids is hard; not only are we
helping them learn potentially difficult concepts, we're also managing
a lot of social issues [3].  It doesn't help that we had the students do
everything in pairs.  Pair programming brought a lot of benfits, but it
also increased the opportunities for difficult camper interactions.

As I said, designing curricular for this age group is not within my area
of expertise.  I generally let the Grinnell students design and run the
curriculum, but I provide feedback.  So both the Grinnell students and
I feel some frustration when we see a lesson plan go less well than we'd
like, or realize only after the fact that there might be a better way to
do things.  We have pages and pages of post-camp notes on how we might
do things differently (and, we hope, better) in future camps.

At times, I ask myself why I chose to run these camps [4].  I also
realized that repeating a camp complicates the data analysis.  This week,
about 1/3 of the campers had attended camp last year.  If our goal
is to build interest and self-efficacy, won't the changes in those
campers be different than those who are attending for the firs time?
We're already dealing with relatively small numbers.  Won't these make
the numbers even smaller.  Oh well, that's part of the joy of research.

In spite of the effort and the complications, it's worth.  We see the
campers grow over the week.  The kids generally have fun and develop
skills.  And there are so many ways in which we see ourselves making
a difference, from the kids who ask "What do I need to do in school so
that I can go to Grinnell?", to the parents who tell us that they have
never before seen their child willing to stand in front of a room and
present, to the pride we see in campers who have chosen and achieved a
complex project.  And we get to meet a lot of really awesome kids.

The Grinnell students get to experience the
joy of seeing a light go on when a camper learns something new.

[1] Designing curriculum in CS is one of my areas of expertise.  But
curricula for college-age students are different than curricular for
4th through 8th grade students.  Course curricular are also different
than camp curricula.

[2] Some of the college students worked into the evening printing out
camper projects or refining their lessons for the next day.

[3] As I say regularly, I have a lot of respect for elementary school
teachers (and middle-school teachers and high-school teachers).

[4] As I said, I'll write about the genesis of the code camps in a
separate musing.

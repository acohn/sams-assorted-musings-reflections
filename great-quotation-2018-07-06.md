A great quotation
=================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), music, Web comics, short*

One in a while, I start reading a Web comic.  A few weeks ago, I started
reading [Bad Machinery](http://scarygoround.com/badmachinery/) because
it was nominated for some award or other.  I'm still not sure how I feel
about the strip; there's a clear British school focus, the introduction
went on a bit long, and I haven't found myself really enamored of any
of the character yet.  But some parts are really awesome.

Here's one of them.

In one strip, Shauna, one of the main characters, is picked up by her
stepfather [1].  After some discussion, they turn to the issue of the music
he's playing.

> What's this rubbish we're listening to?

> The Velvet Underground.

> It's nice that you gave some money to people just playing music for
the first time.

Explaining why I love that quotation feels like explaining a joke; once
you have to explain it, it's not so funny (or powerful) any more.  If you 
know the VU and the bands they inspired, it makes perfect sense.  If you
don't, go listen.  I'd recommend starting with their first real album,
_The Velvet Underground and Nico_ [2].  Some highlights are "Venus in
Furs", "Heroin", and "I'm Waiting for the Man".  But all of the songs are
great.

[1] At least I think it's her stepfather.  It's been about two months
since I read the strip.

[2] I was recently talking to an art salesman who said something like
"The really great artists master multiple forms of media."  I said,
"Yeah, Warhol even produced some really amazing music [3]."  I don't think
he knew what I was referencing.  And the cover is great pop art, too.

[3] Yes, I know that Warhol didn't really produce the album. It's still
worth pretending.

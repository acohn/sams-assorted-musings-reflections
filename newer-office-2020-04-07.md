I have a new office.

No, not the one I moved into in June.  Another one.

Let me explain.  My primary office is in Noyce 3rd.  Since I'm
sabbatical, I gave it up to ensure that one of our visitors could
have an office on Noyce 3rd [1].  I ended up with a new office at
1127 Park Street.  I really like that office.  It has a wonderful
view.  But with the pandemic, I can't be there.  It makes me sad,
especially since I never got to go back and retrieve books.

My home office is not yet fit for human habitation [2].  So I've
been using the dining room table.  And it mostly works.

But we have a problem.  Our Internet Service Provider [3] is
Windstream.  You probably read those first four letters as a noun.
But I'm pretty sure that they're a verb, to wind, as in "Windstream
has the bandwidth of a wind-up toy".  Okay, I have to admit that
it's not that bad.  But almost everyone who uses it agrees that
Windstream can barely wind itself up to support one stream.  And I
have a son engaging in the experiment that is called "unexpectedly
remote learning".  If I'm online when he's online, neither of us
gets sufficient bandwidth.  And he should have priority.

Does that tell you what my new office is?  That's right.  It's my
minivan [4].  I drive to campus, all two blocks.  I park behind
1127 Park Street.  And I log in.  I'd like to walk to campus and
sit outside at the picnic table, but I don't think that's an approved 
activity.  However, the College did say that if we needed Internet
access, we could visit campus in our cars [5].  And so I do.  It
hasn't been ideal.  There isn't a table or similar surface, although
I suppose I could work on that.  Strangely enough, the Internet
isn't great.  I've had it cut out on a Webex meeting and a Zoom
meeting [6].  I wish it would do better.

I assume I'll be using this new office for the next nine or ten
weeks, which represents the amount of time Youngest has left in his
term.  Maybe at some point, I'll be allowed to use the picnic table
or even one of the tables on the interior of campus.  But I'm
avoiding the igloo!

[1] Or I was asked to give it up.  I can never keep that straight.

[2] "Even worse than the lab" or "even more stuff per square foot than
my lab" are two appropriate descriptions of my home office. 

[3] ISP.

[4] I no longer have soccer players, but I still have a minivan.  Given
its rate of rusting, I should have it at least one more year, but not
much longer.

[5] I assume "minivan" fits into their intent.

[6] Don't worry.  I wasn't hosting the Zoom meeting.  And there
weren't and Zoombombers [7], either.  

[7] We did have a BlackboardBomber at CS Table.  I'm pretty sure
everyone knows who it was, though, and they didn't do anything
offensive.

My [first piece for _The Craft of Creative
Nonfiction_](eng207-1b-manuscript) was supposed to be a description
of place.  As you know by now, I made my office the subject of the
piece.  Or at least the location of the piece.  Something like that.
The first name I chose for the manuscript was incredibly obtuse:
"The only mainstream novel by Fredric Brown".  I also toyed with
"The only non-genre novel by Fredric Brown".  Those titles likely
make no sense to you.  I expect it makes sense to fewer than a few
hundred people.  The odds of my readers being one of them are slim.
However, my readers to have eclectic tastes.

For the rest of you, here's the backstory.  [Fredric
Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown) was a genre
author in the 40s, 50s, and 60s.  He wrote science fiction and
mystery, both short stories and novels.  He's known for a variety
of things.  He wrote some fairly funny pieces, at least in SF.  His
first mystery novel won an Edgar Award [1].  Brown was known for
his skill at "short-shorts", stories as concise as you can make
them.  You can read more on [his page on
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown).

Brown also wrote one mainstream novel, _The Office_.  I know this
primarily because I collect Brown and it was a hard book to find,
at least for a time [3].  I'm not sure that I've ever read it [4].
But the connection sticks in my head.  And so I chose the strange
title.

While the draft had the obscure title, I tried to find a way to work in
what I think of as one of Brown's most successful short-shorts, "Knock".
Here's the story, as I recalled it.

> The last man on Earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on
the door ...

I'm pretty sure that it appeared that way in print.  However,
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Brown) tells me
that Brown placed that short-short at the beginning and end of a
longer story.  I'm going to ignore that broader aspect, particularly
since the broader story sounds a bit cheesy.

Before I go on, let me repeat the story.

> The last man on Earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on
the door ...

How do you interpret that?  Would you interpret it differently if
I hadn't told you that it was science fiction?  Or is the SF implicit?
Read it one more time.

> The last man on Earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on
the door ...

What does your imagination conjure?

When I first read it, I thought of aliens.  What else would it be?
But my brain suggests a morass of other possible SF tropes.  It
could be a robot.  It could be a giant mutant cockroach.  It could
be a remote knock from one of the hordes of humans now in space.

Then there's the question of the last man's status in the room.
Has he placed himself in the room, or has someone else placed him
there?  Is he free to move about the room, or is he tied to the
chair, straps digging into his arms and legs?  Is he free to leave?
Can he open the door, or is the knock a subtle form of torture?  I
like that in this form, Brown doesn't tell you.  Rather, he leaves
you to imagine.  Or at least he leaves me to imagine.

Forty or so years since I first read the story, I find that I think
of it differently.  It's still SF, but with a different twist.
"Man" no longer stands for "human".  So in some ways, this could
be a subtle poke at how we read.  The protagonist may be the last
man, but there could be millions of women left.  Or children.  How
would we read the story if it were published in a feminist 'zine?

At least that's what I thought about when I was writing my piece
for class and reflecting on what I might put in this musing.  However,
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knock_(short_story)) tells
me that, in his not-as-short story, Brown explored similar concepts.  He
opens the story with the short-short.  And it is an alien knocking
on the door.  He also ends the story with the short-short.  This
time, it's a woman knocking.

While that may sound good, it's a bit clumsier than I would like.
As you might expect, the woman knocking is the last woman on earth.
And the man got the aliens to leave by relying on a poisonous snake.
That's way too biblical.  Fifteen-year-old Sam probably found it funny.
Fifty-five-year-old Sam not only finds it a bit ham-handed but
also worries about the way it presents the woman in the story.

So let's just return to the short-short and let our imaginations
tell our own stories.

> The last man on Earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock on
the door ...

**_Postscript_**: I never worked in the short-short.  I suppose I
could have incorporated it as a poster or broadside or something.
Or I could have modified it a bit.

> The last professor on Earth sat alone in a room.  There was a knock
on the door ...

Nope.  That's not nearly as good.  But I suppose I could have used
"There was a knock on the door ..." as the title.

[1] The Oscar of mystery novels, or something like that [2].  

[2] "Edgar" is for "Edgar Alan Poe".

[3] Amazon sells a [60th-anniversary paperback edition](https://www.amazon.com/Office-60th-Anniversary-Fredric-Brown/dp/1720161895/).  Surprisingly, I have not bought it yet.

[4] Ah, the wonders of being a collector.

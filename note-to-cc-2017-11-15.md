A note to Curriculum Committee
==============================

I'm wrapping up preregistration and only have a few students left to
register.  One of my more challenging students sent me a message something
like the following [1].

> Dear Professor [2],

> I realize that you think I should take a course in the Humanities next
semester.  I was planning to take [name of course] [3].  However, it is not
offered next semester.  I will plan to take it my senior year.

> In addition, in my remaining three semesters I have to take four
courses for [other major], four courses for my CS major, and two courses
for my [name of concentration] concentration.  I'd also like to take
[course that seems related to the two majors] [4].

What was my reaction?

First, I wondered how we could have ended up in a situation in which the
student needed eight courses for two majors in three semesters.  There are
some complications that led to the situation which are inappropriate
to discuss in a musing [5].  

Next, I wondered why we allowed the student to add a concentration on
top of that.

Then I realized: I never approved that concentration.  So I checked
the concentration declaration form [6].  Lo and behold, although the
concentration advisor has to sign the form, the major advisor does not
[7].  So, even though I'd been trying to step back from worrying about
things [8], I composed a note to Curriculum Committee.

Dear Curriculum Committee Members,

This semester, I've been getting pushback from a lot of students who
say "I can't take X because I need to finish the requirements for my
concentration in addition to two majors".  In many cases, I was not
aware that the student had declared a concentration in addition to their
two majors.

I see from the concentration declaration form that a student's major
advisor(s) need not be consulted for their declaration.  Since the
declaration of a concentration affects a student's four-year plan,
I think all of their advisors should sign off.  (We might even require
the signature of the chair(s) of their major department(s), as in the
declaration of a second major.)  I'd also recommend that an updated
four-year plan be included in the declaration.

I believe this kind of policy is the purview of Curriculum Committee.
I ask CC to consider updating the requirements for concentration
declaration to require that all such declarations include (a) signatures
of their advisors and (b) a revised four-year plan.  I assume that such
a proposal must then go to the faculty.

If such a policy is not in the purview of CC, please let me know where
I should more appropriately address the request.

I wonder if the request will get any traction.  It really is strange that
we treat concentrations so differently than majors in the declaration
process.

I've also realized that I should make students put their four-year 
plan in Self Service [9] when they declare a major so that I can access
that plan at all times and see when they decide to change it.

[1] I have reworded the message and eliminated some identifying details.

[2] Problem one.  Students know I don't like to be addressed in the
generic.

[3] Problem two.  That's a special topics course.  It's unlikely to ever
be offered again.

[4] I'm not sure how many more problems that counts as.

[5] Now that I look at it in a fresh light, I realize that they really
only need three more courses for the CS major.

[6] <https://grinco.sharepoint.com/sites/Registrar/Shared%20Documents/Concentration%20Declaration%20Coversheet.pdf>

[7] Or the major advisors do not.

[8] Please stop laughing.  I'm serious.  I really do plan to step back.  
I've resigned two positions, including one that required me to be at
faculty meetings, for just that reason.

[9] Our online course planning system.

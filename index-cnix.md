Don't embarass me; don't embarass yourself: Some notes on thinking in C and Unix
================================================================================

Introduction
------------

[Introduction, part 1: On the genesis of this work](cnix-intro-1) (Essay #175)

> The genesis of this set of writing.

[Introduction, part 2: Thinking in C](cnix-thinking-in-c) (Essay #176)

> What I mean by "thinking in C".

[Introduction, part 3: Thinking in Unix](cnix-thinking-in-unix) (Essay #178) 

> What I mean by "thinking in Unix"

Introduction, part 4: Thinking like SamR

> Additional perspectives that underlie the rest of the course/book/essays.

Miscellaneous Unix Topics
-------------------------

Regular expressions

> Ways of representing patterns in text.

Combining programs

> Unix systems provide power by allowing you to combine programs
  in interesting ways.  Here are some of them.

Searching files with `grep`

> One way to find things

Searching files with `find`

> Another way to find things.

Miscellaneous C Topics
----------------------

[Stages of C compilation](cnix-compilation-phases) (Essay #179) 

> What some of those stages are, and why you should know.

Additional compiler flags

> C compiler flags you should know.

[Using `assert` in C](assert) (Essay #180)

> An awesomely useful macro.

[Why signatures matter](cnix-signatures-matter) (Essay #190)

> If you don't tell the compiler what you're doing, it may give
  you different results than you expect.

Formatting your C programs

> Why style counts.

Modifiers

> `static`, `extern`, and many more things you never knew you could
  (or should) use.

[Parsing integers](cnix-parsing-integers) (Essay #185)

> How to parse integers sensibly, as well as a variety of other reflections
on program design.

Using Libraries

> Good programmers know how to use libraries (and what libraries might
  be useful).

Building Libraries

> Programmers also know how to build their own libraries.

Make
----

[A simple C project](cnix-simple-c-project) (Essay #181)

> Thinking broadly.

[An introduction to Make](cnix-make-intro) (Essay #183)

> Basics of a build automation tool that we'll use throughout the
course.

[Variables in Make](cnix-make-variables) (Essay #187)

> Why and how to use variables in Make.

[Implicit rules in Make](cnix-make-implicit-rules) (Essay #188)

> Making your Makefiles more general and more concise.

Standard Make targets

> Things you should expect to see in a typical Makefile (and to put
  in your own Makefiles).

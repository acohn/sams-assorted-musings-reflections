Dear Colleagues.

Thank you.

Thank you for sharing your wonderful writing, your careful edits,
your close readings, yourselves.  You have been models for me.

Thank you for allowing an old faculty member to join in you class,
to revel in the joy of learning something different.  I must admit
that I struggled with the workload.  I am impressed by your ability 
to manage four times that workload, or more. 

Thank you for putting up with my strange questions, my dad jokes,
my detours, my personality.  Thank you for accepting Ralph's reactions
to that personality, reactions that seemed particularly strong when
we were in person.  (I can call him Ralph now, right?  The course
is over.)

Thank you for the many perspectives you brought to everything we did.
I reveled in hearing how your different disciplines, your multiple
backgrounds shaped your approach to what we read.

I will miss seeing you twice weekly.  I am so sorry that I will not
be able to watch the seniors march across the stage this spring.
I hope to share with you whenever you are able to March: in December,
or next May, or in five years, or fifty.  (Unless there are significant
changes in medical science, I am unlikely to make your fiftieth.)

I hope that those of you who will return to campus (in August, in
January, in the following August) will stop by and visit my lair
from time to time just to say hello.  I hope some of you will
consider taking CSC 151 from me, or from others.  It looks like we
will be emphasizing digital humanities this year.

I'll be teaching Tutorial this fall, at least if Grinnell has
Tutorial.  I expect that some of you have signed up to be Writing
Mentors.  Perhaps you'll consider signing up to be my mentor.  My
Tutorial will be on Grinnell's open curriculum and liberal education
in the 21st century.

Many of you will keep writing.  Please let me know when you publish
pieces.  I'd love to see where your talents take you.

Unsurprisingly, I have gone on longer than I intended.  Thank you, once
again, for allowing me to share the class with you.

Take care and be well.

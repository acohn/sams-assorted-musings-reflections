Dear Creatively Crafty nonfiCtional Colleagues,

Thank you.

Thank you for sharing your wonderful writing, your careful edits, your close readings, yourselves.  You have been models for me.

Thank you for allowing an old faculty member to join in your class, to revel in the joy of learning something different.  I must admit that I struggled with the workload at times.  I am impressed by your ability to manage four times that workload, or more.  I wish I could say that it will make me change how I assign work, but, given the many factors at play, I'm not sure that it will.

Thank you for putting up with my strange questions, my dad jokes, my detours, my personality.  Thank you for accepting Prof. Savarese's reactions to that personality, reactions that seemed particularly strong when we were in person.  (Sorry to Prof. S for the times I overstepped my bounds.)

Thank you for dealing with my hiccups in online communication, as funny as they seemed to some.

Thank you, also, for dealing with the pre-class faculty gossip.  I wonder what you learned from it.

Thank you for the many perspectives you brought to everything we did.  I reveled in hearing how your different disciplines, your multiple backgrounds shaped your approach to what we read.

I will miss seeing you (or hearing your voices) twice weekly.  I will miss reading your works, being challenged by what you write and by what you say.

I am so sorry that I will not be able to watch the seniors march across the stage this spring.  I hope to celebrate with you whenever you are able to march: in December, or next May, or in five years, or fifty.  (Unless there are significant changes in medical science, I am unlikely to make your fiftieth.)

I hope that those of you who will return to campus (in August, in January, in the following August) will stop by and visit my lair from time to time just to say hello.  I hope some of you will consider taking CSC 151---from me or from others.  It looks like we will be emphasizing Digital Humanities in the course this year.  I'm also currently scheduled to teach "The Evolution of Technology" in the spring; let's critique technology together.

Many of you will keep writing.  (Okay, I hope *all* of you will keep writing, but some of you will continue it as a profession or vocation.)  Please let me know when you publish.  I'd love to see where your talents take you.  And if you want more of my overly detailed, off-the-wall critiques along the way, I'll provide them if you ask and I can find the time.

Unsurprisingly, I have gone on longer than I intended.  Thank you, once again, for allowing me to share the class with you.  (And thank you, Prof. S., for your permission to participate.)

I wish you all success and a sense of achievement on your remaining work.  I know that this time of the semester is often a challenge and that it is particularly so this year.

Take care and be well.

p.s. As I think most of you know, I write a 'blog, of sorts, at <https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings>.  I would like to post a version of this message there to celebrate and acknowledge you more publicly.  I think it is safe to do so because I mention none of you by name in the note, nor do I reference any particular things I learned in class or through your work.  However, I respect your rights to privacy.  Please let me know whether or not you are okay with me posting something; if I don't hear affirmative responses from everyone, I will not post it.

Dear Professor Savarese,

I realize that I should leave this message "on hold" until after I've turned in my notes and portfolio.  However, given that I am about to send a thank-you note to my classmates, this seems to be the appropriate time.

Thank you for permitting me to participate in the class.  I learned so much from you and from my classmates.  You've made me a better writer.  Will you see evidence in that in my musings?  I'm not sure.  If you're lucky, you'll see a bit more variation in my sentence structure from time to time.

Thank you for your careful and pointed feedback.  I expected you to be straightforward, perhaps even blunt, and you met those expectations.

Thank you for the ways in which you show your concerns for those around you, your students, your broader community, those some might think of as the other.  And thank you for helping me think about those concerns.

Thank you for putting up with who I am (see the thank-you message to the students for more details).  I apologize for the times I overstepped my bounds.  I hope there weren't too many.  (Yes, I know that even once is probably too many.)

As always, I enjoyed our conversations about Grinnell policies and politics.  It was nice to have them with more regularity.  Let's find times to chat once you return from sabbatical and we are back to being on campus.

Good luck on the work that you must do over these next few weeks.

Take care and be well.

A fourth month of daily essays
==============================

Believe it or not, but we've reached the end of another month of
essays.  This month was an interesting one, in that I set what feels
like a very different kind of writing goal for myself: Instead of
writing about issues and things, I wrote about people.  I think
it's worth stepping back and reflecting on what I've learned in
this month.

I remain frustrated that I do not write well.  By that, I mean that
I don't feel that my writing sufficiently expresses the feelings
and ideas that I have about people [n,n].  I feel so lucky to be
associated with the many people I write about, and I always find
that the words I use are inadequate to describe these people.  So
I need to find ways to work on my writing.  In particular, I think
that means I need to write less.  Not that I need to write fewer
essays, but that I should write fewer words in each essay and think
more carefully about the words I use [n].  But I'm not sure that
will be satisfactory, because one of my concerns is also that I
don't say enough.  Maybe I should spend more time reading and
focusing much more on the style of what I read.  In any cases,
that's certainly a subject for further exploration.

I *think* my subjects appreciated the profiles.  Even if I do not
write eloquently, I do express my care for people, and it's nice
to feel cared about.  I also take to heart what Erik Simpson said
about these essays ....

I did miss some subjects that I planned to write about (or did I?)

[n] Or about the other things that I write about.

[n] The best example that comes to mind is [my essay about the
bookstore](bookstore.html), in which I do not feel I came close to
expressing the wondeful intellectual home and place of exploration
a bookstore can be.  I have the vision, but not the words.

[n] I think I remember an article about Borges in which it said that he
made sure that each sentence was perfect before he moved on to the next
one.  I'm not sure that I can ever achieve that level of care, but I
certainly could think more about each sentence before moving on to the
next one, or go back and edit more, or whatever.

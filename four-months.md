A fourth month of daily essays
==============================

Believe it or not, but we've reached the end of another month of essays.
This month was an interesting one, in that I set what feels like a very
different kind of writing goal for myself: Instead of writing about
issues and things, I wrote about people.  I think it's worth stepping
back and reflecting on what I've learned in this month.

I remain frustrated that I do not write well.  By that, I mean that
I don't feel that my writing sufficiently expresses the feelings
and ideas that I have about people [n,n].  I feel so lucky to be
associated with the many people I write about, and I always find
that the words I use are inadequate to describe these people.  So
I need to find ways to work on my writing.  In particular, I think
that means I need to write less.  Not that I need to write fewer
essays, but that I should write fewer words in each essay and think
more carefully about the words I use [n].  But I'm not sure that
will be satisfactory, because one of my concerns is also that I
don't say enough.  Maybe I should spend more time reading and
focusing much more on the style of what I read.  In any cases,
that's certainly a subject for further exploration.

I think my subjects appreciated the profiles.  Even if I do not
write eloquently, I do express my care for people, and it's nice
to feel cared about.  I've heard a lot of thanks from my subjects
and from others.  Here are a few [1].

> These are such lovely things to see written about me by someone I
respect so much, and whose work I think about all the time when trying
to be an effective and compassionate teacher.

> I appreciate your words more than I can express, and it’s humbling
to see what you have written [n].

> Wow! I sound interesting!

> This makes me feel incredibly . . . loved [n]. Thank you.

> That is an incredibly kind and gracious essay for you to write, and I really appreciate it.

> You have inspired me to reflect on my experiences.

> This is a very cool thing you're doing for the community.

> I know you’re the computer whiz . . . but I’m pretty sure there’s no attached essay.

> You do know that I have two children, not one, right?

Okay, it's not like you really expected me to have a 100% success rate.

Nonetheless, here's an important moral: *When you think good things about
other people, and write them down, it reminds them that they are special.
Anyone can do that.* I suggest that you try writing similar essays every
once in a while.

I did miss some topics that I planned to write about.  I considered
writing about the protest issue of the _S&B_ to help myself think
through those issues.  I may still write that.  I thought about writing
my speech on the current status of the department.  I've given that
already, but maybe I should still turn it into an essay.  I know that
there were other things I thought about, and forgot to write down.
That's frustrating.  I really do like more freedom each day.

Writing the profiles also set my timing off a bit.  Since I felt that
I generally needed permission to post essays for people I know well,
I'd have to write those essays in advance, and then cross my fingers
that they would approve them in a timely fashion.  That approach meant
that I couldn't always follow my muse as directly as I'd like.  When
I sat down to write at 9pm (or later) some nights, and my muse said
"Write about *this person*", I'd reply, "Sorry, they won't reply tonight.
I'll write about someone else first, and then come back for a few notes
if there's time.  Any suggestions of someone whose permission I don't
need?" [n]  That strategy also meant that there were nights in which
I posted an essay that I had written previously, and then sent out
for approval.  But even on those nights, I wrote, because I always
re-edited those essays [n].

I'm also not sure what this month did to my audience [n].  I think some
people are reading my essays less often, because they don't really 
care about these profiles.  But my sense is that I've picked up a few
readers, too.  I've had at least one student (one who I didn't
know read my essays) ask about the profiles and how I wrote them [n].

Will I continue writing profiles?  Almost certainly.  Will I do another
month of profiles, will I mix them into my regular essays, or will I
do both?  I'm not sure yet.  I was frustrated to have to have a more
limited set of things to write about, so I probably shouldn't limit
myself so much.  But I also kind of like having a theme.  Maybe I'll
even get decent at writing about people if I try another month [n].
But I'll definitely insert "open writing" months in the middle, as well
as months with other foci.

[n] I know that I have a responsibility to cite, but in these cases I
think I also have a greater responsibility to preserve the confidence
of the authors.  So, let's call them all "Anonymous (2016).  Personal
Communication."

[n] I'm humbled by all the things you do.

[n] You are.

[n] Or about the other things that I write about.

[n] The best example that comes to mind is [my essay about the
bookstore](bookstore.html), in which I do not feel I came close to
expressing the wondeful intellectual home and place of exploration
a bookstore can be.  I have the vision, but not the words.

[n] I think I remember an article about Borges in which it said that he
made sure that each sentence was perfect before he moved on to the next
one.  I'm not sure that I can ever achieve that level of care, but I
certainly could think more about each sentence before moving on to the
next one, or go back and edit more, or whatever.

[n] No, I don't really have conversations like that with my muse.
But I did have to put off essays I wanted to write so that I could
write essays that I could post the same night.

[n] And, in many cases, started the next essay.

[n] I'm also not sure that I care.  At this point, I'm writing most of
these essays primarily for me.  The occasional one that serves a
purpose (e.g., promoting Grinnell or CS at Grinnell) gets directed
to appropriate people at appropriate times.

[n] They asked where I got the information for my profiles.  I had to
admit that most of the information is somewhere in my head, which means
that parts are probably fictitious, or at least not quite correct.
But I've been at Grinnell for a long time; I do build up a fund of
knowledge about Grinnellians.  I probably also should have mentioned
that in some cases, I write the essays after the subjects visit my
Learning from Alumni course, and I've managed to both learn new things
about the person and dredge up past memories.

[n] Or ten.

Thinking the best of people
===========================

One of the most important things that my mother taught me is to assume
the best of other people.  She didn't teach me this by telling it to me,
she taught it to me by her actions and by her attitudes. [1] Now, I'll
admit that I wouldn't have as much trust of others as she did; there are
certainly times that I wanted to shake her and shout "Can't you tell that
this person is taking advantage of you?"  But she generally assumed that,
even when someone was taking advantage of her, they were doing so for
a good reason.

Anyway, I find that as I interact with people, even when I get frustrated
with them, I still think the best of them.  I was reminded of this the
other day when I was talking with a colleague about a staff member and
some arguments I was having with that staff member.  I said "I love
[that staff member]."  My colleague said "You're being sarcastic, right?
I thought most faculty didn't like them."  And I said "No.  I'm serious.
While I don't always agree with them, I think they are thoughtful about
their job, they care about Grinnell, they are always willing to discuss
why they make the choices they do, and they listen to my opinion."

I'll admit that I feel like I have a more condensed version of that
conversation a lot of the time.  That is, I'll say that I like someone
on campus, and people will be surprised to hear that, particularly given
their own opinions of that person.  It's not that I don't think my people
on campus make incredibly stupid decisions (see, for example, my recent
article on [Grinnell's Web Presence](grinnells-web-presence.html)), it's
just that in most cases, they are people I've worked with and think highly
of [4].  And, in most cases, I find that almost everyone on campus I work
with does really try their best and, in most cases, is willing to talk
about the choices they make, and will listen to other opinions.  (Yes,
some times even after I provide them with what they should understand
is the correct opinion, they still make other choices.  So maybe they
don't listen well enough.  Or maybe I'm not persuasive enough.)

I have lost my temper with a large number of people on campus [6].
However, when I calm down, I realize that I really do respect those
people.  I'm working on remembering that respect, first, before I
get angry.  It's hard, but I'm trying. [7]  In the end, I should remember
that I respect almost everyone on campus.

Thanks mom!  I'll also remember that even though you thought the best
of people, you also were not afraid to speak out about things that
needed change.  I'll probably write a future essay about that subject,
too.

[1] Okay, her actions and attitudes toward John Silber were not the best
[2], but it's arguable that Silber should really be considered an exception
to the rule.

[2] Mom was known as one of the few BU faculty who would speak out against
Silber. [3] My favorite time was in an interview in _Time_ magazine.  I think
the interviewer asked "But isn't he a brilliant man?"  Mom's response?
"Yes. Ezra Pound was also a brilliant man."  

[3] Speaking out against Silber was not her wisest move.  When I started
as a brand new visiting professor at Dartmouth, my salary was similar to
hers as a full professor at BU.

[4] So, a Bostonian was walking through Hahvahd Yahd, trying to find the 
library.  He encountered a gentleman in a tweed jacket.  Assuming that
this gentleman was a professor, our good Bostonian asked "Where's the
library at?"  The Hahvahd Professor puffed out his chest and said
"At Harvard, we teach our undergraduates not to end sentences with
prepositions."  Our hero paused, thought for a moment, and then asked
"Where's the library at, *@!#@!!#!*?" [5]

[5] The last word in that question has been sanitized for younger
readers.

[6] I'm clearly having trouble with this "positive essay" meme,
aren't I?

[7] My colleagues will tell you that I'm very trying.

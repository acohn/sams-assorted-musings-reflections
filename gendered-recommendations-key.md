A key to the recommendations
============================

In [gendered-recommendations.html](the accompanying essay), I provide a
list of twenty "core sentences" from letters of recommendation.  Here,
I provide the key to those sentences to give you a little more information
about who I am recommending.

I'm only using male/female because (a) these students seem to self identify
as male and female and (b) if I looked at additional characteristics, such
as race, it would be much easier to identify the individual students.

Women: 01, 02, 04, 06, 09, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18

Men: 03, 05, 07, 08, 11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20

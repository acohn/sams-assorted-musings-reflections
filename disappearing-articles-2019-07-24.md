Disappearing articles
=====================

*Topics/tags: [Academia](index-academia)*

This morning, as on most weekday mornings, I pulled up the _Inside Higher
Ed_ newsletter to see the latest news in academia [1].    One article of
interest was titled "**Report: Dream Center Execs Believed They Would Get
Help From Trump Officials**".  For those who don't know, Dream Center is
the latest in a series of for-profit colleges [3] to go bankrupt, leaving
its students stranded [4].  Dream Center is a particularly interesting
case because (a) the Department of Education allowed them to take over a
set of failing institutions, even though they had no prior experience in
higher education and (b) Argosy University, which the Dream Center ran,
[received student financial aid dollars from the U.S. Government, but
failed to distribute it to the students who were supposed to receive
it](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/03/04/argosy-students-lose-out-millions-dollars-federal-aid-goes-missing).

I'm not sure why, but I find myself compelled to read about what is
happening in the for-profit higher-education sector.  Perhaps it's that
I consider that sector part of the reason that so many American distrusts
higher ed; it certainly contributes more than its fair share
toward our national student debt [5,6].  And so I went to read the article.

Unfortunately, when I followed [the
link](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/07/24/report-dream-center-execs-believed-they-would-get-help-trump-officials),
I got a "Page Not Found" error.  Did they put the wrong link in the
newsletter or did the page get taken down for other reasons?

Later in the day, I tried a Web search.  The first result was the
following.

<img src="images/ihe-dream-center" width="600" alt="Report: Dream Center Execs Believed They Would Get Help From ....  https://www.insidehighered.com/.../report-dream-center-execs-believed-the-would-g....  10 hours ago - ...

Yes, that search result linked to the same URL as the newsletter.
In case you were wondering, the link remains down.  At this point, the
page seems to be gone.  It's not even in Google's cache.  I wonder why.

Fortunately, the [_Times_ article on the matter still
exists](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/dream-center.html)
as does [another article in _Republic
Report_](https://www.republicreport.org/2019/house-committee-will-question-devos-aides-over-dream-center-deceptions/).
The latter is a bit more succinct.  As importantly,
[the letter from House Education and Labor Committee
Chairman Bobby Scott (D-VA) to Betsy DeVos about the matter is
available](https://edlabor.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Chairman%20Scott%20Letter%20to%20ED%20re%20Dream%20Center.pdf).
Let's see ...

> As outlined in the body of this letter, the actions of Dream Center and
the Department of Education's (Department) execution of its responsibility
to protect students raises [sic] [8] grave concerns.  The Committee has also
come across newly-obtained documents [sic] [9] that raise questions about
whether the Department took steps to allow Dream Center to mislead students
and how the Department should have better protected students.  The documents
reveal that during this period, HLC clearly and consistently indicated to
Dream Center that it must notify students enrolled at these institutions
of the change in status.  Yet, the documents indicate that Dream Center
executives knowingly ignored HLC's requirements and continued to falsely
market the institutions as accredited by HLC.

> The documents also reveal that Department officials were made aware of Dream
Center's false claims of accreditation, but the Department did not 
immediately require Dream Center to take corrective action.  Instead,
the Department informed Dream Center executives that it would to
retroactively accredit the institutions during the period they had
lied to students&mdash;rewriting history to erase Dream Center's
deceptive marketing practices.  The documents further suggest
that Department officials were not forthcoming to Congress and the
public about the information they had about Dream Center's status and
practices. [10]

I'm lazy and busy.  I don't want to read through all the articles, the
whole letter, and all the attachments.  However, in my quick skim I was
able to note that Exhibit 5 appears to be an email from Principal Deputy
Under Secretary Diane Auer Jones about the expectations placed on Dream
Center.  Since Jones seems to be the official most implicated in this
mess, I'm probably missing something.  I see that multiple documents also
refer to [an earlier article in _Republic Report_ that describes similar
issues](https://www.republicreport.org/2018/devos-aide-tailors-decisions-to-the-predatory-colleges-who-employed-her/).

It's too much of a morass to wade through right now.  I wish that the
_IHE_ summary still existed.  And I'd like to see the comments from the
normal cast of commenters on _IHE_.  Oh well.

In any case, I'm still left wondering:  Why is the article gone?
Did _IHE_ get threatened?  If so, was it by Dream Center lawyers,
by the Department of Education, by _The New York Times_ [11], or some
other entity?  Or perhaps they've decided to work on a longer article
for tomorrow's edition.  We shall see.

Postscript: Continuing down the rabbit hole, I decided to see how much
of the article I could retrieve using different search terms.  The result
of my first search [12] read,

> Department official would pull strings to help with accreditation challenges after ... Dream Center, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit with no prior ... The Trump administration's oversight of the transaction has now come ... 

With a slightly different set of search terms [14], I got,

> The Trump administration's oversight of the transaction has now come under ... The Times reports that Dream Center executives discussed in ...

Another set of terms [15], gave me,

> Internal company emails and documents show executives at Dream ... pull strings to help with accreditation challenges after its purchase of a ...

It's always fun to pull out words.  "Accreditation Challenges pull strings" [16] yielded,

> Dream Center Education Holdings believed a top Education Department official would pull strings to help with accreditation challenges after ...

Ooh, "Accreditation Challenges after Dream Center" gives me

> The Higher Learning Commission, which accredited several Art Institutes campuses, pulled its accreditation in January 2018. ... Jones also said the accreditation issues didn't push the chain of colleges toward financial collapse but only dictated whether students could transfer credits elsewhere.

And "Internal company emails and documents show executives at Dream" results
in,

> Internal company emails and documents show executives at Dream Center Education Holdings believed a top Education Department official would pull strings to help with accreditation challenges after its purchase of a chain of for-profit colleges, The New York Times reported Tuesday ...

"Jones Dream Center" results in,

> Dream Center, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit with no prior higher education ... Diane Auer Jones, the department's principal deputy under ...

Let's try direct quotes.  "'The Trump administration's oversight of the transaction has now come'" yields,

> The Trump administration's oversight of the transaction has now come under scrutiny from consumer groups and congressional Democrats. The Higher Learning Commission, which accredited several Art Institutes campuses, pulled its accreditation in January 2018.

Progress!  

With a bit more work, here's what I ended up with.  It's clearly not
the complete article, but it's enough for now.

> Internal company emails and documents show executives at Dream Center
Education Holdings believed a top Education Department official would
pull strings to help with accreditation challenges after its purchase
of a chain of for-profit colleges, The New York Times reported Tuesday.

> Dream Center, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit with no prior higher
education experience, agreed to buy the Argosy University chain and
multiple Art Institutes from Education Management Corporation in 2017.
The Trump administration's oversight of the transaction has now come under
scrutiny from consumer groups and congressional Democrats. The Higher
Learning Commission, which accredited several Art Institutes campuses,
pulled its accreditation in January 2018.

> Diane Auer Jones, the department's principal deputy under secretary
and point person for higher ed policy, told Congress she was unaware
of the HLC decision until almost six months later.  Jones also said
the accreditation issues didn't push the chain of colleges toward
financial collapse but only dictated whether students could transfer
credits elsewhere.

Yeah; I don't know what to do with that extended excerpt.  But I feel
a strange sense of accomplishment.  I should find a way to automate the
process.

Postscript: Was there a point to this musing?  It started out as an
exploration of why an article might disappear.  It gave me a chance
to rant a bit about for-profit institutions of higher education.  And
it led me down one of those rabbit-holes of "can I do this on the Interweb?"
Yeah, I think I need to add "rambly" to the tags [17].

[1] I also read _Chronicle_.  However, I find myself drawn to _IHE_ because
it has more short articles and includes more discussion [2].

[2] Some of that discussion gets irritatingly repetitive.  But I also see
some interesting insights.

[3] Strictly speaking, Dream Center is a non-profit.  But it's so closely
tied to the for-profit world.  Among other things, it shares a leader with
Woz U [4].

[4] No, it's not Steve Wozniak, formerly "the better Steve".  I'm 
disappointed that (a) Woz would set up this kind of entity in the
first place and (b) that he'd partner with the kind of people who ran
Dream Center.

[5] Non-profits are also going bankrupt.  However, most of those do their
best to do so in a fashion that tries to limit harm to students, including
making sure that they finish the current semester's courses.  In contrast,
the [Dream Center shut down in mid-March, with little, if any, warning to its
students](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Nightmarish-End-of-the/245855).

[6] If I recall correctly, for-profits are responsible
for ten percent of students in higher education, but 25%
of federal student loans.  My ten-minute Web search failed to
support that claim.  However, I did find that the [_Chicago Booth
Review_](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/public-policy/2019/article/who-s-fault-student-loan-defaults)
says that "For-profit colleges enroll 10 percent of US students but
account for 50 percent of student-loan defaults".

[7] I should also acknowledge that the for-profit sector often seems to
do a better job of understanding the needs and issues of non-traditional
students.

[8] I think that should be "raise".

[9] I think that should be "newly obtained documents".

[11] _IHE_'s "quick takes" are often summaries of articles from elsewhere
on the Interweb.  And, as you'll see in the postscript, this article seems
to be based on one from _The Times_.

[12] Whoops.  I forgot to record my search terms.

[14] I forgot to record those, too.

[15] You can probably predict what happened to those search terms.

[16] Finally, I recorded them.

[17] I originally had "short".  That term no longer seems to hold.

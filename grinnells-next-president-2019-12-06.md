Grinnell's next president
=========================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell)*

Yesterday, Grinnell announced that President Kington is stepping
down at the end of the year [1].  That got me thinking about what
characteristics I'd like to see in our next president or even who
I'd like to see as our next president [2].  It's unlikely that I'll
have any direct role in that selection; I have neither the personality
nor the role on campus that would make me a good member of a search
team for that position.  I would also be reluctant to promise that
much of my time for that task; I would much rather spend it on,
say, [better ways of assessing the open
curriculum](innovation-fund-2019-09-27).  Nonetheless, my muse
insists that I reflect on these issues.

For the majority of my time at Grinnell, we've had presidents whose
background you would not naturally associate with a liberal arts
institution.  President Kington came to us from outside of academia
and there are still times that his background in government and
policy show clearly.  President Osgood, in contrast, was an academic
at heart.  But his discipline, law, was not one that is traditionally
included as part of the primary offerings at undergraduate institutions
like Grinnell [5].  That's not to say that law and legal thinking
could not play an important role; just that one rarely associates
legal education with undergraduate education.

So, part of me says that I'd like to see someone whose background
is more closely aligned with the core academic program of the
College.  That is, I'd like to see an academic whose scholarship
is in one of the areas in which we offer a degree.  I'll admit that
I'd see some benefit to having a president from a humanistic
discipline, particularly at a time in which Grinnell is doubling
down on the humanities [6,7].  While I'd like an academic, I also
accept that there can be value in finding someone who brings in new
perspectives and can help Grinnell grow in new ways.  I guess it
depends more on the person than on their background.

Perhaps it's better to reflect on characteristics that I'd like to
see in our new president.  I accept that others will likely have a
different set.  For example, I won't list "fundraising" as an
important skill, but I acknowledge that it's an important one for
any president and, perhaps, a particularly important one for Grinnell
at this juncture in time. But perhaps the fundraising skills, as
well as the others characteristics that other people may value, are
closely related to those I list below.

I'd like to see a president who appreciates and embraces Grinnell
for what it is and what it can be.  Of course, I accept that different
folks have different views of what Grinnell is.  But I also know
that there are many shared values, particularly those represented
by [our mission statement and set of core
values](https://www.grinnell.edu/about/at-a-glance/mission) [8],
particularly excellence in education, a diverse community, and
social responsibility.  However, those don't include the strong
sense of student empowerment that is reflected through both the
individually advised curriculum and the notion of self governance,
and I'd like that to be something our new president embraces.

As the market in higher education changes and as far too many people
focus primarily on "employable skills", I'd like like to see a
president who can advocate well for liberal arts education and for
the humanities.  Raynard certainly grew into this but struggled
at first in expressing an appreciation for the humanities.

I think of the president and dean as serving as a bridge between
the trustees and the faculty.  I'd like to see a president who
advocates for both perspectives.  Certainly, Pam Ferguson, who was
president when I arrived, was known as a strong advocate for the
faculty.  Over the years, that role seems to have moved more to the
Dean's office.  And, while I know that Dean Harris will be an
excellent advocate for Grinnell's faculty [9], I'd like to see our
new president share that role.

A variety of other characteristics would likely support that role.
Certainly, the president should have a strong appreciation for
shared governance and the roles of of faculty in shared governance.
The president should be someone who works collaboratively, interested
in hearing the perspectives of others.  However, I must note that
different people have different experiences of collaboration.  I've
heard people describe both Osgood and Kington as not particularly
collaborative.  I've also heard people describe both as quite willing
to listen to ideas.  Personally, I always found President Osgood
always willing to talk through issues with me, even if I sometimes
wondered whether it was just that he found me amusing.  President
Kington and I seem to butt heads much more often.  But in most
circumstances in which we disagreed, he's been willing to explain
his perspective.

It is essential that our president is someone who supports the
people who work under him and who people want to work with.  Since
I'm not one of the president's direct reports, I'm not sure what
might underlie those characteristics, or how we evaluate them [10],
but they are essential.  Of course, I would also hope that the president
is someone who inculcates the values of shared governance in his
staff.

I don't know whether or not it's the president's responsibility,
but I'd like to see a president who could take a leadership role
in building bridges between faculty and staff [11].  I'm not sure
all of the factors that have led to the state, but it seems like 
both groups are feeling under-valued and perhaps even undermined
by members of the other group [12].

Finally, I'd like to see a president who is able and willing to
explain their perspective to students and to listen to students'
perspectives.  The same holds for alums, although I would prioritize
students over alums.

[1] He's moving on to be Head of Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.
I'm not sure what it says that our Dean and President both moved on to
leadership positions in secondary schools.  I realize that both schools
are incredibly prestigious.  However, it's not the normal path for a
college leader.

[2] For example, I count at least five or six Grinnell faculty members who
have left to become Deans, Provosts, or Presidents at other
institutions [3,4].  Any one of them would likely make a great president
for Grinnell.

[3] Let's see ... [Brad
Bateman](https://www.randolphcollege.edu/president/bradley-w-bateman/) is
president at Randolph College; [Jon
Chenette](https://www.vassar.edu/faculty/jochenette/) was Dean,
Acting President, and Interim President at Vassar; [Kathleen
Skerrett](https://as.richmond.edu/contact/kskerret/) was Dean at
the University of Richmond; [Marci
Sortor](https://wp.stolaf.edu/doc/provost-sortor/) is Dean and
Provost at St. Olaf, and [Mark
Schneider](https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/3174-mark-schneider) is
Dean at Ursinus.  

[4] [Angela
Onwuachi-Willig](https://www.bu.edu/law/profile/angela-onwuachi-willig/) is
now Dean at the Boston University School of Law.  While she wasn't
strictly a Grinnell faculty member, she's closely enough tied to
Grinnell that I can add her to my list of five.

[5] Washington and Lee is a notable exception.

[6] At least I hope we're doubling down on the humanities.  I see the
Center for the Humanities, the Institute for Global Education, and the
Humanities and Social Studies Center as evidence that we are
doing our best to emphasize the value of the humanities.

[7] I must admit that our hiring patterns, or at least our allocations
of tenure-track positions, provide less evidence of that commitment.

[8] Has "Support for professional well-being of all whose work
contributes to the College" always been part of this core values
list?  And if so, why is it not "professional and personal well-being"?

[9] And, I presume, for the trustees when speaking to the faculty.

[10] We could ask people who worked for them, but that is likely
a violation of candidate privacy.

[11] Or between faculty, staff, and administrators.

[12] I fear that some of my musings might have played a role in
some staff members' negative experiences.  Since I value our
staff highly, I'm doing my best to mediate my comments.

What do you listen to? part one
===============================

_I'm working in the lab with my students this summer.  As is typical for
students of this generation [1], they have a rotating playlist of songs.
Early on, they asked me "Sam, do you want anything on the playlist?"  I
said "*Astral Weeks*, by Van Morrison".  So, once in a while I get to hear
Richard Davis's amazing bass lines and Van's equally amazing voice in
the midst of whatever they listen to.  They haven't really commented on
it at all, but they've dealt with the less poppy, more introspective music._

_Today, they wanted more than that [2].  In particular, they asked "What
kind of music do you like?"  They were not happy with my response of "I
will listen to almost anything [3,4]."   They wanted groups and songs.
I wasn't up to a long discussion, so I said something like "You already
know that I like the Rolling Stones.  I also like the Beatles.  If you
want individual songs that I love, add 'Roadrunner' by the Modern Lovers
and 'Los Angeles' by X to the playlist [5]."  I also promised to make
today's musing about my musical tastes.  So here we go._

I listen to a wide variety of music, from classical to straight-ahead
rock to traditional jazz to punk to acapella to classic country to soul
to cowpunk power-pop to classic rock to Americana to garage to folk to
choir music and beyond.  The particular music I feel like listening to
varies from day to day, and from hour to hour.  I enjoy being surprised by
hearing an old favorite come up.  I also enjoy finding new music I like.
I tend to prefer melodies, but I've been known to listen to Sonic Youth,
Sonny Sharrock, and the Swans [6,7].

It may be easiest for me if I write about the development of my musical
tastes.

My parents liked both classical and folk music [8].  My mother was fond
of having me "guess the composer" while we were listening to music in
the car, usually on WBUR, if I remember correctly.  I'm sad that over
the years, I lost that ability.  Too much pop interfered.  Mom had also
served as a secretary at Peoples Music, so I grew up on a diet of Woody
Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and the Weavers.  She regularly brought me to the
Christmas Revels, and so those forms of music resonate.

At some point, I inherited some Beatles albums from one of mom's students
and grabbed mom and dad's copy of Dylan's _Bringing It All Back Home_ and
the folk anthology _Folk Song and Minstrelsy_ from the downstairs stereo.
I love the Beatles.  I still remember when they broke up.  But I stopped
playing the Beatles as much when John Lennon died [9].  It's not that
it hurt to listen; it's that I heard so much Beatles music on the radio
at the time that it ended up feeling a bit too much for me to take.

When I was twelve or so, mom asked her students what records to get me.
They recommended _Sloppy Seconds_ by Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show
and _Tommy_ by the Who, _More Hot Rocks (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies)_
by the Rolling Stones, and _Band on the Run_ by Paul McCartney and Wings
[10].  Two of these seem strangely inappropriate for a pre-teen [11].
Were mom's students having fun with her, or serious?  I'll never know.
But all three are albums that I continue to enjoy, in different ways.
Certainly, every time I listen to Keith Moon's drumming, I hear something
new.  And while none of the Dr. Hook songs are what I'd call great music,
I still love them all.  I know that _More Hot Rocks_ is a mishmash of
leftovers, but I loved it, and still do.  I still hear the Stones, rather
than Buddy Holly, when I think of "Not Fade Away".  _Meaty, Beaty, Big,
and Bouncy_ joined the bunch some time afterwards, as did most of the
Wings albums, Dylan, and a bunch more.  At some point, I started 
listening to Cat Stevens [12].

Some time in high school, I started exploring music more actively.  I was
prompted, in part, by my friend Andrew, who had amazing and eclectic
tastes [14].  As an addictive sort, I ended up reading a bunch of
different resources for interesting music, including _The Rolling Stone
Record Guide_, _The Trouser Press Record Guide_, _Christgau's Record
Guide_, and _Stranded_ [15].  I enjoyed scouring the bins at Nuggets and
the other record stores in the Boston area.  During that time, I picked
up many albums that remain favorites: _The Velvet Underground and Nico_,
_The Modern Lovers_, _Nuggets_ (and spin-offs like _Pebbles_), _Music
from Big Pink_, _Astral Weeks_, almost anything by Sam Cooke and Otis
Redding, and more.

But I liked things other than rock.  I continued to enjoy Pete Seeger,
the Weavers, David Mallett [16], and more.  I enjoyed music from classic
musicals, as well as newer ones like _Sweeney Todd_, _Company_, and _A
Chorus Line_ [17,18,19].

At some point along the way, I was visiting a friend's house and
commenting on the cool albums that his father had, most of which were
then out of print.  His father suggested that those were the music of his
time, and I should pay attention to the music of my time.  When I went
off to college, I took that to heart, and tried to look for interesting
new things as well as the classic albums.  I spent way too much time
at Second Hand Tunes [20].  During this time, I fell in love with the
music of X, The Blasters, Nick Lowe, Jonathan Richman [22], the Clash,
The Turbines, and more.  I saw R.E.M. and the Violent Femmes at the
Living Room in Providence.  I saw X, the Blasters, Los Lobos [23] and
more live in Chicago.   I saw H端sker D端, Richard Danko and Levon Helm,
X, Buddy Guy, Jonathan Richman, and a bunch of other bands I forget live
at the UofC [24].

I also took Gerald Mast's courses on The American Musical, and continued
to enjoy those great songs.  I fell in love with Ella Fitzgerald's
interpretations of many of those songs, as well as the many other things
she did.  But _Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter_ songbook and _Ella
and Louis_ are certainly long-term favorites.

Looking back, I regret that I did not take advantage of the University of
Chicago folk festivals while I was an undergraduate or graduate student.
I'm not sure why.  I was probably too busy with Doc Films.  Looking
backwards, I missed some incredible performances.

_This musing is already getting too long, and I'm just through college.
Let's take a break and perhaps list a few of the albums and songs from
this period that remain on my "special albums" and "special songs" lists,
or at least make me happy whenever I hear them.  Since I'm only spending
ten minutes on these lists, they are woefully incomplete._

Whoops.  That was more than ten minutes.  And this list feels like I'm just
scratching the surface.  There's a reason that I didn't want to answer
my students' question.  Maybe I'll work on some playlists for my kids.

---

[1] And, likely, students of every recent generation.

[2] I don't think it's that they particularly loved _Astral Weeks_;
it's more that they were interested in what I listen to.

[3] That response is true.

[4] I usually say "my musical tastes are catholic, with a small 'c'".

[5] That's not my exact statement, but it's close enough.

[6] Do my students know who any of those artists are?

[7] I don't mean to say that none of these individuals or groups are
melodic.  It's just that in my experience, melody is not the primary
attribute I'd assign to their music.

[8] That's not quite true.  I know that my mother liked classical and
folk music.  I'm not sure what my father liked.  I know that there were
times he certainly liked silence.  His brother loved jazz.  I do remember
that he loved the soundtrack from _Guys and Dolls_.

[9] If I remember correctly, my friends and I heard about it the shooting
while we were sitting in the lounge in "The Village".

[10] I'm sure of the first few.  I'm less sure of _Band on the Run_.

[11] Shel Silverstein wrote the Dr. Hook songs and many of them dealt
with sex and drugs even more explicitly than was common for the time.
_Tommy_, of course, starts with a traumatic murder.

[12] I probably listened to Cat Stevens because of _Harold and Maude_.

[14] Andrew has been in a variety of bands (with released CDs) since 
high school.  I think he's still playing actively.

[15] _Stranded_ is a fantastic book of rock critics writing about their
favorite music.  

[16] A Maine folksinger, perhaps best known for writing "Inch by Inch".

[17] No, they were not all by Sondheim.

[18] My uncle took me to see _A Chorus Line_ in NYC some time early in
the original run.  It was awesome.

[19] I know there is some controversy about the authorship of _A 
Chorus Line_.  If I recall correctly, many of the original performers
did not receive adequate compensation for their contributions to the
show; many of the stories in the show are based on their own experiences,
and they deserve more than they got.  

[20] Second-Hand Tunes was conveniently across the street from
Harold's Chicken Shack [21].

[21] I would be remiss if I did not recite Dwayne's statement: "When the
gods on Mount Olympus tire of nectar and ambrosia, the go out for 
Harold's."

[22] I already had a few albums by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers.
But seeing him live and solo expanded that love.

[23] With Phil Alvin joining them on stage!

[24] At the time, we called the University of Chicago "UofC" rather
than "UChicago".  We also used 1892 as the founding data, rather
than 1890.  Sometimes I wonder whether it's still the same institution.

[25] It certainly wasn't their best album, but it was the album they
were promoting when I saw them, and many of the songs still resonate
in my brain.

[26] I find that my R.E.M. albums have not aged as well as many other
things I loved at the time.

[27] I'm not sure why I listed four Cat Stevens albums and did not list
nearly as many Beatles albums, particularly since all of the Beatles albums
are probably more essential.  But as I looked through the song listings
on the Cat Stevens albums, all of them resonated.

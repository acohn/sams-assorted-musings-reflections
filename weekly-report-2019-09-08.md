DadR's weekly report, week 1
============================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical)*

This fall, the Rebelsky family [1] is starting to spread out to the
ends of the country.  Eldest is off to Massachusetts; Youngest is off
to California.  I'm on sabbatical and traveling a bit more than normal.
In a year or so, Middle will head off somewhere.  While we will keep in
touch with each other in different ways, I thought it would be useful
if we did something more regular and more formal. So I've suggested that
we each write a weekly report of what we've done recently.  Three of us
have agreed.  I've decided that I'm going to post my reports as musings.

The highlights of this week?  I enjoyed having dinner at Relish with
Michelle, Middle, and Youngest on Friday night.  The food was good and the
company was even better.  It's also nice to have a longer-than-normal
family dinner; we got to chat about more topics than we normally do.
Earlier in the week, I finally got around to fixing the stove.
What's that I said to Michelle? I think it was "anxiety is a bear".
Stoves are scary.  But it works now.  Yay me!  Three other highlights
were the Writers@Grinnell talk on Monday night, Jen Jacobsen and Andi
Tracy's presentation on second-year students on Friday, and the Women's
Volleyball game on Friday night; it's nice to have some time to get out.

Having more time is nice.  It seems like I seem more relaxed than normal.
That's good.

The week also had some lowlights, mostly related to technology.
The [MathLAN Web server](web-server-2019-09-07) was taken down late
Friday night.  I'm not sure what the plans are for bringing it back up.
That's frustrating.  Today, both mom and I managed to disconnect my
backup drive while I was backing up the old laptop to give to Daniel.
Now the backup drive is not working.  Have I mentioned that I hate
computers?

What else happened?  I've been posting book covers to Facebook.
I think Jon challenged me to do so.  (If not, Jon challenged mom
and mom challenged me.)  I've also been posting photos from campus.
I've enjoyed thinking about books that I love, and I've enjoyed finding
things to take photos of.  When I looked for a cover of _People's History
of the United States_, I discovered [a signed first edition for sale for
$2,800](https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/a-peoples-history-of-the-united-states-howard-zinn-first-edition-signed-1980-3/).
I checked, and, although my copy is a first edition, first printing,
I never had Howard sign it.  Oh well, mom and I have lots of other books
that Howard gave us.

I've been less productive than I'd like to have been this week.  I guess
that happens. The next few weeks look to be busy, but not necessarily with
research.  I have grants to review and meetings to attend.

I've been doing some reading for fun.  At the start of the week, I read
some books by Kim Beall.  First, I read _Seven Turns_ after seeing it
mentioned in a book review column by Charles de Lint.  I seem to recall
that the review said something like "A surprisingly nice tale marred by
an awful cover."  It turned out to be free on Kindle Unlimited,
so I gave it a try.  The book was an engrossing rural fantasy [2].
Since many questions are left unanswered at the end of the book, I
was happy to see that a sequel, _Moonlight and Moss_ was available.
You should be able to read both in our Kindle library.  

I also read _The Pizza Delivery Boy's Tale_, which is a short story,
published only in book form, that explores that background of one
character in the two books that Beall has written.  To be more precise,
although it focuses on one character, it gives a bit more background on
multiple characters.  Plus it has maps related to the books.  I think
Beall suggested reading this before _Moonlight and Moss_, but the ordering
I chose seems better to me.

I still haven't gotten around to building any of the book boxes.  I'm not
sure if I'll start before Youngest heads off to college.  I realize that
after that, I'm on my own.  I'll send you pictures if I ever find the
time to build some.

Last, and perhaps most importantly, I signed up for a water aerobics
class.  It starts tomorrow.  We'll see how it goes.  I should try to
sneak in some other exercise.  (It doesn't help that my knee hurt during
the second half of last week.)

I love you all! [4]

---

[1] This Rebelsky family, at least.

[2] A term I use as an alternative to "urban fantasy" for books that
take place in the present [3], include a significant fantasy element, and
take place in a rural area.  I also worry that for some, "urban fantasy"
has shifted from describing the novels of, say, Charles de Lint and Emma
Bull to come what seems to be more "paranormal romance".

[3] More or less.

[4] While I likely love other my readers, too, this last comment is
intended for members of the Rebelsky clan.

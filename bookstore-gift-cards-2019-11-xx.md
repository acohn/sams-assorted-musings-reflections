Bookstore Gift Cards
====================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants)*

Over the years, I've accumulated a bunch of gift cards for the
Grinnell College Bookstore.  Some are those that my kids received
as gifts and they then exchanged with me [1].  Others are those I
purchased to give out as prizes for various class events and have
not yet given out.

The other day, I stopped by to use some of them to purchase George
Drake's _Mentor_, which is yet another book on my to-read list [2].
But when they went to use my gift cards, many had nothing on them.
I found that strange, given that I traditionally throw out cards with
nothing left on them.

Then I talked to the manager.  It appears that a few years ago,
someone in the Treasurer's office decided that the amount on unused
gift cards counts as "Unclaimed Property" and must be turned over
to [the State of Iowa's Great Iowa Treasure
Hunt](https://greatiowatreasurehunt.gov/).  If I recall correctly,
that happens about five years after the cards were issued.  But,
well, from my perspective, they aren't unclaimed property.  I still
have the gift cards and still intended to use them or give them
away.  In fact, I gave a few away last year and the year before.
I apologize to those students if they got to the Bookstore and
discovered that there was nothing on the card.  I wonder why they
didn't tell me [3].

But here's the thing.  When I bought them, I was told that they
remained good indefinitely.  So shouldn't the Bookstore still honor
them?  Fortunately, [there's a FAQ for that](https://greatiowatreasurehunt.gov/app/faq-report).  From that FAQ, I see that

>  When efforts by the holder - the entity who is holding the unclaimed funds for the owner - to locate the rightful owner fail, the funds must be turned over to the state treasurer, who is then responsible for safeguarding these funds, publicizing the names of the rightful owners and returning the funds back to the owners as they come forward. 

So the first question is: "Should the Bookstore have known that I
had gift cards?"  In some cases, the answer is "Yes".  When they looked
them up, they saw my name on them.  The FAQ suggests to me that their
first step should have been to contact me (or my kids).

But there is likely no name associated with the remaining cards.  What
happens to the anonymous holdings.  Fortunately, there's an answer to
that question, too.

>  **What happens if an owner comes forward to claim an amount that our company reported in the aggregate?**

> You will pay the owner and request reimbursement from the treasurer's office. You will need to complete a Holder Reimbursement Form, which tells our office what year you reported the funds and the amount that needs to be reimbursed. 

So I think the Bookstore needs to pay me back.

[1] I regularly buy them books at the bookstore, so things usually balance
out.

[2] Expect a musing on the topic next year.

[3] Presumably, they decided "Sam must be senile and didn't realize
that his cards had no value".

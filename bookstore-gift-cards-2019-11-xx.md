Bookstore gift cards
====================

**This musing is in draft form and is not intended for public release.**

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants)*

Over the years, I've accumulated a bunch of gift cards for the
Grinnell College Bookstore.  Some are those that my kids received
as gifts and they then exchanged with me [1].  Some people gave to
me (although I don't recall why).  Others are those I purchased to
give out as prizes for various class events and have not yet given
out.

The other day, I stopped by to use some of the cards to purchase George
Drake's _Mentor_, which is yet another book on my to-read list [2].
But when they went to use my gift cards, many seemed to have nothing
on them.  I found that strange, given that I traditionally throw
out cards with nothing left on them.

Then I talked to the manager.  It appears that a few years ago,
someone in the Treasurer's office decided that the amount on unused
gift cards counts as "Unclaimed Property" and must be turned over
to [the State of Iowa's Great Iowa Treasure
Hunt](https://greatiowatreasurehunt.gov/).  If I recall correctly,
that happens [about five years after the cards were
issued](https://greatiowatreasurehunt.gov/app/gift-cards).  There's
even a FAQ for that.

Fortunately, [there's a FAQ for
that](https://greatiowatreasurehunt.gov/app/faq-report).  From that
FAQ, I see that,

>  When efforts by the holder - the entity who is holding the unclaimed funds for the owner - to locate the rightful owner fail, the funds must be turned over to the state treasurer, who is then responsible for safeguarding these funds, publicizing the names of the rightful owners and returning the funds back to the owners as they come forward. 

Nonetheless, from my perspective, they aren't unclaimed property.
I still have the gift cards and still intended to use them or give
them away.  I even gave a few away last year and the year before.
I apologize to those students if they got to the Bookstore and
discovered that there was nothing on the card.  I wonder why the
students didn't tell me [3].

And here's the thing.  When I bought them, I was told that they
remained good indefinitely.  And I'm pretty sure that the Credit
Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the
Credit CARD Act) says that cards with expiration dates must explicitly
have that expiration date on the front of the card.  These cardds
have no explicit expiration date, So shouldn't the Bookstore still
honor them?

I also see that the policies I quoted above also indicate that the holder [4]
is supposed to make efforts to locate the rightful owner.  Does the state
say anything else about that issue?  Yes, in [the description of 
unclaimed property](https://greatiowatreasurehunt.gov/app/what-is-ucp),
it says,

> The organization holding the original obligation is required to make every effort to contact the owner and establish activity. If they are not able to make contact, the asset is reported to the state of the ownerâ€™s last known address. 

My name is on the cards I received.  My kids' names are on the cards
they received.  So it should not be hard for someone to contact us
via email to indicate that we have funds available on gift cards.
And my name is associated with the other cards as purchaser.  So a
good faith effort would include contacting me to see who I had given
them to.  I wonder what the implications are of their failure to make
a good-faith effort.

Nonetheless, for whatever reason, no one was able to figure out that
I had the cards, which means they got reported in the aggregate.  What 
happens to the anonymous holdings?  Fortunately, there's [an
answer to that question](https://greatiowatreasurehunt.gov/app/faq-report#claim-aggregate) [5], too.

>  **What happens if an owner comes forward to claim an amount that our company reported in the aggregate?**

> You will pay the owner and request reimbursement from the treasurer's office. You will need to complete a Holder Reimbursement Form, which tells our office what year you reported the funds and the amount that needs to be reimbursed. 

Thay all seems pretty clear to me.  And I thought everything would be
resolved when I left my cards at the bookstore the other day.  However,
today I received a message from the Treasurer's office indicating that
(a) it was my responsibility to file forms to get back the money on the
cards that I or my kids had received as gifts and (b) they would not
reimburse the money for the cards I had purchased to give as rewards
for participation in CS- and art-related events.  I was not happy, to say
the least.

But then they offered to talk to me about the matter and ....

[1] I regularly buy them books at the bookstore, so things usually balance
out.

[2] Expect a musing on the topic next year.

[3] Presumably, they decided "Sam must be senile and didn't realize
that his cards had no value".

[4] That's the Bookstore or the College.

[5] I'm too lazy to put in full citations.  I'll assume that the links
serve as appropriate citations.

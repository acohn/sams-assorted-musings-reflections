As all of my readers should know by now, Grinnell decided to switch
the structure of the 2020-2021 academic year to use seven-week (plus
two days of finals) "terms" rather than our traditional fourteen-week
(plus one week of finals) "semesters".  Other than the broad rationale
that's been used for most decisions [1], I'm not sure what explict
reasons we've been given for the switch.  I recall hearing (a)
working on two classes at once rather than four will be better for
student stress levels, (b) terms make us more agile, and (c) um,
something else.  Okay, I feel like I've only heard those two reasons.
What does "more agile" mean?  I've understood it to mean a variety
of things.  If the pandemic worsens, we could potentially cancel
Fall Term 1 or Fall Term 2 [2].  If the pandemic lessens and a
vaccine is found, we could significantly increase the number of 
students here in Fall Term 2.  We're already planning a bit of that.

Right now, I'm seeing the costs of switching to a term system.  And
I find myself wondering how carefully folks considered those costs
in making the decision to switch to terms.  I respect a lot of the
College's leadership; but this could be one of those decisions made
by one or two people that everyone was asked to go along with.

What costs am I seeing?  One obvious cost is that of redesigning
classes to meet the new term model.  While we would likely need to
make significant changes to our courses as they move online, changing
to a different pace, number of days per week, and number of hours
per session is a completely orthogonal set of changes.  For a
back-of-the-envelope calculation, I would say that it will require
at least twenty hours per course to convert it from a semester model
to a term model.  And, yes, that's a WAG [3].  But I'm looking at,
say rewriting my Tutorial from scratch rather than adopting the
current model, which will be much more than twenty hours.  Even for
CSC 151, which may maintain some similarites, I'm going to have to
make major adjustments to when work is due and what kind of work I
assign.  I assume other faculty are facing similar challenges [4].
If we have three-hundred different course offerings across the year
[5], that represents six thousand hours of work or the equivalent
of three people working full time for a whole year.  And that's my
conservative estimate.  Now, I have to admit that those hours are
free to the College; we're not getting paid for our summer work and
we don't generally get paid for course development.  Nonetheless,
there is a real human cost, as well as the cost to morale and mental
wellness.

I hate to say this publicly, but I think the switch to terms will
come at a cost to the quality of learning.  In part, that's because
many courses, including Tutorial, will have less time in class and
more time on independent work.  (Maybe I shouldn't say this publicly.
Maybe I should just ask.)

Then there's the administrative burden associated with the shift.  I
don't want to think about how much time the amazing staff of the
Registrar's office have had to spend on this.  I don't want to think
about how much time they will be spending re-entering all of the course
information for both semesters.  I don't want to think about how much
reprogramming is going to be necessary to get Ellucian to appropriately
show and credit terms.  I wonder how much that reprogramming is going
to cost the College.

Etc. Etc.

[1] "We have approached every decision about the coming school year, including this one, using a public health framework that prioritizes the health and safety of our students."

[2] In this situation, I worry about sending students home for Fall Term 2.

[3] Wild Approximate Guess.

[4] I expect that many of the colleagues reading this musing are
cursing me for such a low estimate as they anticipate at least twice
those twenty hours, or more.

[5] I expect it's higher than that.

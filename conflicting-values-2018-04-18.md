Conflicting values
==================

*Themes/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), [rants](index-rants), diversity, writing to learn*

*Warning! I am using this musing to think through some complex topics,
and am expressing some opinions openly.  Many readers may find those opinions
offensive.*

Recently, I've been struggling with a situation in which two of my primary
values [1] seem to be coming into conflict.  What are those values?  One is
that I care deeply about the principle that the faculty have primary
responsibility for the academic program at Grinnell.  The other is that I
value diversity and want to do what I can to support not only the broad
concepts of diversity and inclusion at Grinnell, but also the experiences
of individual students from underrepresented groups.

At first, it felt strange to me that these two values came into
conflict [2].  Certainly, in designing both the curriculum in CS and
the teaching methodologies in CS, issues of diversity and inclusion are
always on our mind.  But then I realize that there are certainly a wide
variety of ways in which more traditional or less reflective curricular
decisions can have a huge impact.  For example, the [whole situation at
Reed](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/11/the-surprising-revolt-at-reed/544682/)
suggests a clear conflict between the two values.

But that particular conflict is not what is keeping me up at night.  So
let me tell you the Grinnell-specific issue, which is less public and
very different, but which I find equally problematic.  It seems best to
start with the background, which I'll report in a primarily temporal
narrative.

A few years ago, when [President Kington exercised the nuclear option
on Grinnell's partnership with the Posse
foundation](posse-termination-revisited), a number of staff members
were in the unenviable position of trying to quickly create new programming
to address the loss of Posse and to provide better support for 
students from underrepresented groups on campus [3].

One of the ideas proposed was that we have a common reading on diversity
for incoming students.  So the idea was pitched to the Tutorial and
Advising Committee, which is supposed to be the primary body responsible
for College-wide aspects of the academic program for incoming students.
The Committee rejected the suggestion.  And that should have been the
end of the matter, or at least a temporary end to the matter [4].

But the Dean's office decided on a different approach.  I'd phrase it as
"If the committee won't approve our idea, we'll just do it on our own. [5]"
So the Dean's office decided that we should have a common reading.  I
will admit that I raised objections at the time.  I was told "Don't
worry; we're treating this as something clearly separate from the academic
program."

And that's where I thought things stood.

But then this past fall, as I was giving my standard "Why you should
attend [Scholars' Convocation](convocation) speech", I heard a very
different interpretation.

...

Add John's note about Tutorial.

My first reaction to all of this was not positive [n].  I was tempted to write
an essay entitled "Usurpring faculty responsibilities" or "Usurping the
faculty's primary responsibility".

[n] That's an understatement.

But I've heard, and also believe, that we have to make some significant
changes to Grinnell if we want to be a place that is appropriately
inclusive.  And it's clear that the common reading plays an important
role in helping move Grinnell forward [n]

[n] Believe it or not, but one of the first things I wrote in response
to our assurance agreement was "Section 3.B.4. I'm surprised that the
common reading is not mentioned in this section.  That strikes me as
a particularly powerful way in which we promote human and cultural
diversity in our educational program."

So how do I balance those two values?  That is, how can I simultaneously
support the common reading

---

[1] Or priorities, belief structures, something similar.

[2] Of course, experience our curriculum from a position of power
and as someone who primarily identifies with majority groups.  Those
who experiene our curriculum differently may not feel the same.

[3] We had needed to provide better support for those students in any
case.  But the abrupt termination meant that we had to provide evidence
that we were doing *something*.

[4] The way things often work at Grinnell is that when a sugestions fails,
you go back and consider the criticisms, find ways to refine or improve it,
and ask again.  It's probably a more time-consuming process than it should
be, but it often produces better results.

[5] Note that this is an example of higher-level power dynamics in play.
The Dean's office gets to override faculty.  Faculty don't get to
override administrators.  For example, as a faculty member, I don't get
to say "I'm going to offer a class at this time the Registrar rejected"
or "Even though you said we can't search for a tenure-track faculty
member, I'm going to" or even "I'm holding an event in JRC 101;  Campus
Catering charges significantly more than a competitor would charge;
I'll use a comptitor."

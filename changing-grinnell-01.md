Changing Grinnell, take one: Alumni mentors
===========================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), marketing, alumni*

In [a recent musing](marketing-grinnell-2018-05-09), I noted that it is
difficult to market Grinnell to prospective students because many of
the things that make Grinnell special don't necessarily seem unique.
Certainly, the individually advised curriculum is relatively unique [1]
and we can talk about its centrality to the institution.  And I really do
believe that our culture empowers students more than most institutions.
It's not just self governance or student leadership of large organizations
like [press].  It's also the attitude that when students come up with an
idea, there are people on campus who will find a way to support that idea
[2].

Nonetheless, the many strengths of Grinnell (e.g., student initiative,
student-faculty research, close student-faculty interactions, emphasis
on the social good, a strong global component, a collaborative culture,
innovative teaching) also appear to be strengths of our peer institutions.
So why would someone choose Grinnell over, say, a seemingly comparable 
institution [in a large city](grinnell-location)?

If we can't just highlight our strengths, we probably have to distinguish
ourselves in other ways.  So how do we make Grinnell more unique?

Unfortunately, as I look at our three most recent major initiatives, only
one of the three seems relatively unique.  Research opportunities for all?
I hear lots of our peers talk about research opportunities.  The Institute
for Global Engagement?  The literature of many of our peers talks about
how international they are.  Do we do these really well and even better
now that we have the initiatives?  Yes.  Can a prospective student tell
that?  Probably not.  The other initiative is a donor-funded "Career
Communities" project that groups students with advisors related to their
likely career goals.  That's a new and useful idea at Grinnell.  But,
now that I think more about it, may also be somewhat common.  Certainly,
a health professions advisor is a common role.

In [the earlier musing](marketing-grinnell-2018-05-09), I suggested
that we consider making some changes to Grinnell.  I do not envision
changes that significantly affect the core values and strengths of
the institution.  I would not, for example, advocate the addition of
a law school or business school.  Nor would I advocate that we become
a single-gender institution.  However, I do think that the College can
find new things to do that will (a) distinguish ourselves and (b) build
upon our core strengths.

Of course, identifying appropriate and useful changes requires time,
energy, and discussion.  But I have a deadline to meet.  So I'm going
to follow my standard inclination of coming up with something relatively
quickly and seeing where it goes.

Fortunately, it seems like I thought about this issue a month or so ago,
so I have at least one idea to start with.  There's some background to
how I came up with the idea in the first place.  I had originally tried
to incorporate the background in this musing, but it seems better to
cover it in a future musing.

So, let's turn to the idea: _Grinnell should pair every student with
an alumni mentor_ (or a team of alumni mentors) (or advisers).

One of Grinnell's great strengths is a group of active and engaged alumni.
Whenever we meet alums, Michelle tells me how impressed she is with the
alumni network.  I regularly hear from Grinnell alumni that they tend to
bond with each other, even if they did not know each other at Grinnell.
There's something about having been at Grinnell that makes them more
similar to each other or at least more inclined to be with each other.
I've regularly seen Grinnellians on [Plans](https://grinnellplans.com/)
provide helpful advice to each other.  And I know that our alumni want to
do more to help the College, or at least to help students at the College.

So let's build on that strength.  Let the alumni help students by
serving as informal mentors or advisers.  They can talk to students
about navigating Grinnell's academic world and social scene, about
the pressures that many students face, about preparing for life after
Grinnell, the power of exploring new areas outside core interests,
and so on and so forth.

I don't have all of the details worked out.  But the basic idea is that we
will gather a cadre of available alumni mentors.  When a student enrolls
at Grinnell, they will be assigned one of these alumni mentors, possibly
based on shared interests or characteristics.  The mentors would meet
with the students via videoconference every other week to talk through
whatever the student is thinking about (or perhaps things the mentor or
the College suggest they talk about).  They might also be available via
email or Slack for quick questions.

I realize that there are a wide variety of people on campus who can
provide similar advice.  But I expect that it will feel different to have
someone helping who is doing so as a volunteer and not because it's part
of their job.  And it will feel different to get support from someone
who has "been through the bubble", as it were.

In some ways, this idea builds upon something we're already doing.
For most of my time at Grinnell, students had one primary academic adviser
[3].  Now, most students also have an adviser from the Center for Careers,
Life, and Service and an adviser from Student Affairs.  I must admit
that I bristled a bit at first when I heard that we were adding other
"advisers".  I know that some of my colleagues worried that these other
advisers might undermine the primary faculty advice.  However, the more
I've thought about it, the more I've supported the idea.  I've always
relied on folks from across campus to help students; I sent students
to CLS to talk about strategies for finding internships and to Academic
Advising to help them think about better study strategies.  Why not have
someone who knows them well as a starting point for these kinds of issues?

If three kinds of advisers (academic, career, student life) are useful,
wouldn't a fourth also be useful?  What do I see as benefits to this 
approach?

* It gives students access to a different kind of advice.  And, in
  many ways, advice from a sensible graduate can be heard differently
  than advice from a faculty member or staff member.
* It gives alumni a chance to be more involved in the life of
  the College.  I know that many of our alumni would like to have ways
  to give back that are more substantive than just money; mentorships
  provide a not-too-time-consuming way to be involved and to make a real
  difference [4].
* It helps distinguish Grinnell.  "While we empower you to make your
  own decisions, we know that you will want to rely on advice from others
  in making those decisions.  When you come to Grinnell, you will form
  a team of advisers and mentors.  In addition to a faculty member who
  will guide you through your academic planning, you will be assigned a
  staff member from Careers, Life, and Service who will help you think
  about longer-term career planning, a staff member from Student Affairs
  who can help you develop a plan for navigating extracurriculars,
  and an alumni adviser who can serve as a sounding board [5,6]."

What would we need to do to put this type of project into play?
Certainly, we would need buy-in from across campus.  Faculty would need to
be willing to accept a bit less authority.  CLS and Student Affairs would
also need to accept that the alumni adviser might give different advice.
But I'd hope that we'd generally play well together.

We'd also need an infrastructure to train and assess the alumni advisers.
Certainly, I'd want all of them to have implicit bias training and Title
IX training.  But they'd also need a bit more guidance on how to guide.
Those who had been away from campus longer might need to be updated on
new things at Grinnell, such as the addition of a Statistics concentration
and the status of Media Studies.

We'd probably need someone on campus to manage the endeavor, or need to
free up a few staff members' time to contribute to this program, or both.

We'd need to work out a host of details: How do we pair students
and alumni?  Do we have each alum advise only one student, or do we
have alumni work with small cohorts of students?  What happens when the
pairing does not work well or a student's interest change?  Can students
choose a new alumni adviser?  If so, how?

As I noted at the beginning, I might also consider giving students
access a team of alumni advisers/mentors, although that seems harder
to coordinate.

That's what I've got for the time being; it's supposed to be a quick idea,
not one that I've fully fleshed out.  But the more I think about it,
the more enamored I am of it.  I'm considering floating the idea by CLS
[7], Admissions [8], and Alumni Relations [9].  Perhaps I'll see what
my readers say first [10].

[1] Brown also has an individually advised curriculum.  I know that a
few other institutions do, too.

[2] Here's one example.  When I was touring schools with Middle Son,
we heard many institutions brag about the startup weekends that they
offered to their students.  But those activities were driven from above.
Grinnell's Pioneer Weekend came from a bunch of students developing an
idea which was then supported (financially and administratively) by the
Wilson Center.

[3] Or two, or three, depending on how many majors and concentrations
they declared.

[4] For the alumni reading this: externships are another cool and 
relatively easy way to give back!

[5] Yeah, it needs work.  A lot of work.

[6] Imagine my surprise to discover that [our new admissions site](http://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell)
includes the following text:

> With three advisers to cover every aspect of your experience, all
driven to help you contribute and belong to our community, the moments
for mentorship and support are limitless.

There's even a separate page about [the three
advisers](http://ww3.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/community/advisers).

[7] I'm pretty sure that at least one member of CLS regularly reads
my musings.  I may contact that person.

[8] I've been told that a few folks in Admissions regularly read my
musings.  But I'm not sure who they are, so I may just contact the
director of admissions.

[9] I have not heard that anyone from alumni relations reads my musings.

[10] Note: That was a prompt.  What do you think about this idea?

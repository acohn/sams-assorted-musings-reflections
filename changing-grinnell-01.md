Changing Grinnell, take one: Alumni mentors
===========================================

*Topics/tags: [Grinnell](index-grinnell), marketing*

In [a recent musing](marketing-grinnell-2018-05-09), I noted that it is
difficult to market Grinnell to prospective students because the things
that make Grinnell special don't necessarily seem unique.  Certainly,
the individually advised curriculum is relatively unique [1] and we can
talk about its centrality to the institution.  And I really do believe
that our culture empowers students more than most institutions.  It's not
just self governance or student leadership of large organizations like
[press].  It's also the attitude that when students come up with an idea,
there are people on campus who will find a way to support that idea [2].

Nonetheless, the many strengths of Grinnell (e.g., student initiative,
student-faculty research, close student-faculty interactions, emphasis
on the social good, a strong global component, a collaborative culture,
innovative teaching) also appear to be strengths of our peer institutions.

If we can't just highlight our strengths, we probably have to distinguish
ourselves in other ways.  So how do we make Grinnell seem unique?

In [that musing](marketing-grinnell-2018-05-09), I suggested that we
consider making some changes to Grinnell.  I do not envision changes that
significantly affect the core values and strengths of the institution.
I would not, for example, advocate the addition of a law school or
business school.  However, I do think that the College can find new
things to do that will (a) distinguish ourselves and (b) build upon
our core strengths.

Indentifying appropriate and useful changes requires time, energy,
and discussion.  But I have a deadline to meet.  So I'm going to follow
my standard inclination of coming up with something relatively quickly
and seeing where it goes.

Fortunately, it seems like I thought about this issue a month or so
ago, so I have at least one idea to start with.  There's some background
to the material, but I think I'll cover that background in a separate
musing.  

So, let's turn to the idea.

---

One of Grinnell's great strengths is a group of active and engaged
alumni.  I regularly hear from Grinnell alumni that they tend to bond
to each other, even if they did not know each other at Grinnell.  I've
watched as Grinnellians on Plans provide helpful advice to each other.
Michelle keeps telling me how impressed she is with the alumni network.

And I know that our alumni want to do more to help the College, or at
least to help students at the College.

So let's build on that strength.  In particular, we should assign every
Grinnell student one or more "alumni mentors or advisors".

I don't have all of the details worked out.  But the basic idea is that we
will gather a cadre of available alumni mentors.  When a student enrolls
at Grinnell, they will be assigned one of these alumni mentors, possibly
based on shared interests or characteristics.  The mentors would be meet
with the students every other week to talk through whatever the student
is thinking about (or perhaps things the mentor or the College suggest
they talk about).  Mentors can talk students through the difficulty
of handling Grinnell's academic or social scenes, remind them of the
value of exploring new options, talk about planning for possible career
directions, and so on and so forth.

I realize that there are a wide variety of people on campus who can
do similar things.  But I expect that it will feel different to have
someone helping who is doing so as a volunteer and not because it's
part of their job.

In some ways, this idea builds upon something we're already doing.  For
most of my time at Grinnell, students had one primary academic adviser
[3].  Now, most students also have an adviser from the Center for
Careers, Life, and Service and an adviser from Student Affairs.  I
must admit that I bristled a bit at first when I heard that we were
adding other "advisers".  I know that some of my colleagues worried
that these other advisers might undermine the primary faculty advice.
However, the more I've thought about it, the more I've supported the
idea.  I've always relied on folks from across campus to help students;
I sent students to CLS to talk about strategies for finding internships
and to Academic Advising to help them think about better study strategies.

What do I see as benefits to this approach?

* First, it gives students access ot a different kind of advice.  And, in
  many ways, advice from a sensible graduate can be heard differently
  than advice from a faculty member or staff member.
* Second, it gives alumni a chance to be more involved in the life of
  the College.  I know that many of our alumni would like to have ways
  to give back that are more substantive than just money; these provide
  a not-too-time-consuming way to be involved and to make a real difference.
  [4]
* Third, it provides something really unique about Grinnell.  "While
  we empower you to make your own decisions, we know that you will want
  to rely on advice from others in making those decisions.  When you
  come to Grinnell, you will receive a team of advisers and mentors.
  In addition to a faculty member who will guide you through your
  academic planning, you will be assigned a staff member from Careers,
  Life, and Service who will help you think about longer-term career
  planning, a staff member from Student Affairs who can help you
  develop a plan for navigating extracurriculars, and an alumni
  adviser who can serve as a sounding board [4]."

What would we need to do to put this type of project into play?  First,
we'd need buy-in from across campus.  Faculty would need to be wiling to
accept a bit less authority.  CLS and Student Affairs would also need to
accept that the alumni adviser might give different advice.  But I'd
hope that we'd generally play well together.

We'd need an infrastructure to train and assess the alumni advisers.
Certainly, I'd want all of them to have implicit bias training and
Title IX training.  But they'd also need a bit more guidance on how
to guide.

We'd probably need someone on campus to manage the endeavor, or need to
free up a few staff members' time to contribute to this program, or both.

We'd need to work out a host of details: How do we pair students and alumni?
Do we have each alum advise only one student, or do we have alumni work with
small cohorts of students?  What happens when the pairing does not work well
or a student's interest change?  Can they choose a new alumni adviser?  If
so, how?  I might also consider giving students access to teams of alumni
advisers, although that seems harder to coordinate.

As I said, it's supposed to be a quick idea.  I'm considering floating
the idea by CLS [6], Alumni Relations, and Admissions [7].  Perhaps I'll
see what my readers say, first.

[1] Brown also has an individually advised curriculum.  I know that a
few other institutions do, too.

[2] Here's one example.  When I was touring schools with Middle Son,
we heard many institutions brag about the startup weekends that they
offered to their students.  But those activities were driven from above.
Grinnell's Pioneer Weekend came from a bunch of students developing an
idea which was then supported (financially and administratively) by the
Wilson center.

[3] Or two, or three, depending on how many majors and concentrations
they declared.

[4] Externships are another cool way to give back!

[5] Yeah, it needs work.

[6] I'm pretty sure that at least one member of CLS regularly reads
my musings.  I may contact that person.

[7] I've been told that a few folks in Admissions regularly read my
musings.  But I'm not sure who they are, so I may just contact the
director of admissions.

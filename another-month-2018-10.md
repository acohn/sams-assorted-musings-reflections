Another month of (almost) daily musings
=======================================

*Topics/tags: [End-of-month musings](index-monthly), rambly*

I've reached the end of another month of (almost) daily musings.  Or,
more precisely, *we've* reached the end of another month, since I do
have some readers along for the ride.  One of my habits in the project
I call "SamR's Assorted Rants and Musings" is to step back at the end of
each month and reflect a bit about the experience of writing regularly,
what I've written about, and, perhaps, what I've learned by writing.
In some months, I also include some statistical data, such as how many
musings I seem to have written in the past year or how many forthcoming
topics remain in my "sketchbook", as it were.  And, once in a while,
I set goals for the coming month [1].

What did I write about this past month?  Here's the list, taken from
my automagically generated [list of musings by number](index-by-number).

[A note to my Obermann colleagues in preparation for our upcoming seminar](obermann-note-2018-10-29) (Musing #794)  

Hmmm ... That's thirty musings in a month.  Arguably, I should have
written twenty-nine [2].  So I'm doing a bit more than a daily musing.
However, I have not necessarily spread them out evenly.  There were
some days, and maybe even some two-day sequences, in which I did not
write or post musings.  There were, therefore, a few days in which I
wrote [3] and posted two musings.  I guess that's how things go.

What did I write about?  It's clear that I was having trouble writing,
or at least writing technical material, because I mused on two separate
occasions about my writer's block. Fortunately, the second such musing
seems to have helped.  Yesterday, I wrote about three thousand useful
words of technical material [4].  Unfortunately, today was less successful.
I spent three hours on "small" tasks, such as responding to email messages
and doing planning, two hours reading a colleague's paper in preparation
for the Obermann seminar, and one hour preparing my own material for that
same seminar.  That, along with the travel back and forth, left no daytime
for writing.  Will I write this evening?  I'm not sure.  And tomorrow,
once again, is filled with meetings.  I guess the answer should be "Yes,
I will *try* to write something this evening."

The Obermann seminar also inspired some writing, including
[two different versions of a project description for CSC
151](fundhum-project-01) [5], a detailed rubric for one of those
projects [6], and [a note to my colleagues giving some background on the
project](obermann-note-2018-10-29) [8,9].  I'll write more about that
seminar soon [10].  But I will include one comment here.  I asked about
the writing in the projects.  One colleague said, "Like everything you
write, it's warm and inviting."  Clearly, they have not read my rants [11].

Speaking of rants, I did rant a bit.  I rant almost every month.  I'm a
[curmudgeon](curmudgeon).  I can't avoid ranting.  I ranted about
[end-of-course evaluations](eoce-history) [12],  I ranted about [our
new ad campaign](go-forth-grinnellian) [14].  I ranted about [the
way too many things that were making me grumpy](grumpy-2018-10-04).
I even wrote a long followup rant that I decided not to post [15].
I ranted about [hurdle rates](hurdle-rates).  I ranted about [my
inability to use software](pandoc-link-nonbug).  Wow.  That's more
than I thought.  It was clearly a bad month.  But don't worry, even
though I'm in a better mood, I still have some accumulated rants.

Speaking of software, it seems that this was also a month for technical
musings.  In addition to my comment on Pandoc, I wrote about [scraping
data](joc-course-schedule), [dealing with the GitHub repository for
these musings](musings-clearing-cruft), and [my experience as someone
who likes both Unix and macOS](linux-on-macos).  I'll probably continue
with some technical musings in the coming month, not least because
a colleague suggested that I switch from MacPorts to Homebrew.

Beyond those topics, I managed to write a few more in my
long-standing series of [Grinnellians you should know (or know
about)](index-grinnellians), a few "[reviews](index-reviews)", and a
bunch of short musings.  I'd like to write about a few more Grinnellians.
However, some of those will require research time, and I'm not sure
that I have research time.  I may review a few more things that I read,
listen to, or see.

What were my plans for this past month?  [I didn't have
any](another-month-2018-09), other than that I would struggle less
[16].  I managed that.  What were my plans for the prior month?
[Let me see](another-month-2018-08).  I was going to reread _Style_
and muse about it.  Nope.  I was going to continue my quest for [inbox
zero](index-email).  Not only did I not manage to write about it [17],
I failed to keep up on my work on managing my inbox [18].  I was going
to write about my experiences at the Obermann Center.  I did that.
I was going to try to read an article or a book chapter each day.  Nope.
Way to go, Sam! More seriously, though, I'm doing what I can; I've
had a lot of things interfere that not only consume my time, but also
consume my mental energy.

What about my plans for the coming month?  I've already said that I plan
to write a bit about Grinnellians.  I won't be able to avoid ranting.
Most of my writing energy needs to go toward my textbook, so I'm not
going to set any other musing goals.

We'll see where I am in a month.

Postscript: It wouldn't be an end-of-month musing without some silly
statistic.  Unfortunately, it's a bit harder to report on the number
of musings I've written in the past year since I did not write an
end-of-month musing in September, October, November, or December
last year.  Let's see, what did I write last October?  The last musing
of that month was [about advising](week-of-advising-oct-2017) [19].
That musing was #472.  This musing is #796.  I've written 324 musings
in a year [20].  That's not quite a musing a day, but close.

---

[1] No one ever expects me to meet those goals.  Nonetheless, I find it
useful to choose potential foci.

[2] There are thirty-one days in October, unless the delay of daylight
savings time has changed the length of the month.  I wrote my end-of-month
musing for September on October 1.  I'm writing this musing on October
31.  That leaves twenty-nine.

[3] Or finished writing.

[4] I may muse about that writing soon.  Or perhaps not.  My backlog of
musings keeps growing.

[5] As the list suggests, both of those ended up as musings.

[6] Ooh!  Something else to muse about. [7]

[7] Or, as Grammarly seems to want me to write, "Something else about 
which to muse."

[8] Yup, another piece of writing that ended up as a musing.

[9] Even after having written that two-page letter, I ended up giving
more background.

[10] And another musing.

[11] I suppose one could call my rants "warm and inviting".  They are warm
in that they have some heat from anger, but not an exceptional amount.
They are inviting in that I invite others to share in that anger.

[12] That wasn't quite a rant, but it was close.

[14] That's another "rant lite", as it were.

[15] If you feel like looking in the GitHub repo, you can probably
find it there.

[16] I guess my writer's block was worse than I remembered.  At least
this month, I did not have trouble musing.

[17] Well, I did take some notes.

[18] I did set up some filters, which is making it easier to read all
the primary email.  However, I'm still not good about filing.

[19] As I read the name, I thought it might be about preregistration
since that's almost upon us.  However, it ended up being a log of what
advising I'd done that week.  And wow, it's a lot.  Even though I'm still
spending time on advising-like issues while on leave, it's much less than 
when last year, when I was in my office every day.

[20] I thought about writing "I've mused 324 times in a year", but I
muse more than I write.

Swimming and ... that other thing
=================================

*Topics/tags: [Rants](index-rants), end-notable*

As I've mentioned in other posts, I appreciate attending swimming
and diving meets.  These days, I'll admit that I enjoy diving more
than swimming, and it's not just because Middle Son took it up
when he started college.  Swimming is mostly about speed, or at
least I don't know enough about the sport to observe and appreciate
subtle differences in form.  Diving, in contrast, is about form and
grace.  I may not always be able to tell why a dive gets a four
rather than a seven, but I can appreciate the form and grace of the
divers [1].

Grinnell has had some fantastic divers who are a particular joy to
watch.  We currently have a diver who made nationals in her first year
and continues to show great strength in her dives.

But it feels like diving ends up as a second-class citizen. Last
night, the divers were doing the three-meter dives at the same time
as swimmers were competing and there wasn't a separate video feed
for diving.  And, while the video feed did show the divers in the
distance, I hear from some parents who couldn't be there that they
often overlaid video of the scoreboard on the section of the video
feed that showed the divers.

Today, I'm told that the video feed was much better.  However, the
list of divers didn't show up in the heat sheet.  I expect the
absence was unintentional.  But for those of us who want to follow
along, it's frustrating.

It would also be nice to have a separate scoreboard for diving.
The few times that diving happened independently, it's been wonderful
to be able to follow along and tell how each diver is doing alone
and in competition with others.  There are times that I've set up
a spreadsheet, but it's distracting to try to have to get all the
data into the spreadsheet rather than to pay attention to the divers.

I realize that we can't hold diving and swimming at separate times.
But that means that the divers have to put up with a lot of distraction.
I'm not sure how they manage to do complex dives while people are shouting
to swimmers just a few yards away or cheering G-A-C incredibly loudly just
as they leave the board [2].  It must be particularly painful when people
are swimming breast.

I don't have solutions to any of these issues.  There are significantly
more swimmers (and swim spectators) than there are divers.  We only
have one scoreboard.  There is not time to run separate meets.  I
also don't think any of this is anyone's fault.  But it's still
frustrating to see these fantastic athletes get less attention and
support than they deserve.

Postscript: My muse insists that I end this musing with a bad pun.
Since divers(ity) is one of Grinnell's core values, shouldn't we
pay particular attention to our divers?

[1] It helps that I managed to decode the diving numbers.

[2] Yes, that happened last night.  A Gustavus Adolphus swimmer
apparently took first in some event [3] and the team immediately
shouted "G-A-C".  But a diver was jumping on the board at the time,
doing one of those things I call "a five dive" [4], dives which
I expect take particularly strong concentration.

[3] That's not surprising; GAC is far ahead in this competition and their
swimmers won many heats.

[4] Dives that start with a 5 include both a somersault and a twist.
For those who care about the notation, the first digit after the five
includes the starting position (1 is forward, 2 is backward, 3 is
reverse [5], and 4 is inward [6]), the next digit is the number of
half-somersaults [7], the next digit is the number of half-twists,
and the final letter indicates their position in the air (A is straight,
B is pike, C is tuck, and D is anything goes).  Most of the five dives
are done with a D.  If you don't like decoding dives yourself, you can
always check [a handy table](http://www.usadiver.com/dd_table.htm) [9].

[5] That is, jump forward and flip backward.

[6] That is, start backward and then jump toward the board.  Those
are the dives that make parents the most nervous.

[7] For example, a prefix of 512 means "forward, one somersault", which
means that the diver will enter the water with their fit pointed downward.
In contrast, a prefix of 513 means that the diver will do one and a half
somersaults, entering the water face-first [8].

[8] Well, arms first.

[9] Hmmm ... that table includes flying dives.  I don't think I've seen those
in our competitions.

Down yet another rabbithole
===========================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), the Interweb, art, rambly*

The other day, I received an email [1] from the MIT press advertising
some books they thought I would deem of interest.  Their algorithms
work relatively well.  I passed along information about [a new book on
Twitterbots](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/twitterbots) to some colleague
who are studying them.  I also considered whether I should read it as
part of my preparation for teaching the digital-humanities-themed CSC 151.
But the book that really caught my eye was [_The Jean Freeman Gallery Does
Not Exist_](mitpress.mit.edu/books/jean-freeman-gallery-does-not-exist).

For those who are as uninformed as I am, the Jean Freeman Gallery was a
conceptual art piece by [Tery Fugate-Wilcox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Fugate-Wilcox) [2] and Valerie Monroe Shakespeare [3] consisting of
advertisements for a gallery that did not exist.  I appreciate a lot
of conceptual art, particularly pieces that are intended to challenge
assumptions and that have a bit of snark about them.  And so I went to
find out more.

I saw from the page that Fugate-Wilcox also does other kinds of conceptual
art that I find interesting, particularly ones that evolve as they enounter
the environment.  

Wikipedia page: Artworks get plastered over with papers.
Probably not part of his design.  But [images of the plastered-over
work](http://terryfugatewilcox.com/weathering-concrete-triangle-in-1993-looking-southeast/)
do appear on his site.

Speaking of weathering triangle.  Googled for more images.  At first I was excited
because I thought I was seeing diagrams from the planning process.  But
then I realized that many of them were [scientific diagrams](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Triangular-weathering-classi-fi-cation-based-QAI-index-and-mineralogical-properties_fig6_269398304).  Perhaps that's part of his intent.

I appreciate that it was not a commissioned work.  It appears that
[his wife purchased the small triangle of land it is/was situated on](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/08/nyregion/new-york-day-by-day-119471.html)

But [now it seems to be gone](http://terryfugatewilcox.com/site-of-weathering-concrete-triangle-august-2016/).  However, [the Smithsonian doesn't seem to realize that](https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=ariall&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!307093~!0#focus).  

There's also [a clone of the Wikipedia page at Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Terry_Fugate-Wilcox)

Went looking for his biography.  Interestingly,
there are two Kindle editions, [one released in
2008](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Life-Valerie-Monroe-Shakespeare-ebook/dp/B0018D7TR0/)
and one released in
[2012](https://www.amazon.com/Its-artists-life-me-1-ebook/dp/B009YJEW3O/),
after Shakespeare passed away and now marked as "Volume 1".  [I think this
is the third edition.]

It's the Artists' Life for Me!

End up watching [a video from the gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRC27kmZfF8).

3000 a.d. Diffusion piece.  The [image of it covered in
graffiti](http://terryfugatewilcox.com/base-of-3000-a-d-diffusion-piece-covered-in-graffiti/)
cites Wikiwand as the source ["image sourced from Wikiwand".  But I'm pretty sure that Wikiwand took it from Wikipedia.  And the [Wikipedia page on the image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tery_fugate_wilcox_si_detail.png) cites the Smithsonian.  Interestingly, that page links to [a very different image of
the same work](http://www.nycgovparks.org/photo_gallery/full_size/20362.jpg).
I did find the image on [the Smithsonian's Art Inentories Catalog](https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!307082~!2) [The Smithsonian seems to generate long URLs; it's really hard to cut it down to something I'm sure will work for everyone.]

[Another one showing how high the graffiti goes](http://terryfugatewilcox.com/3000-a-d-diffusion-piece-covered-in-graffiti/)  Similar incorrect citations.

Tried to look at it with Google Maps.  If I follow the "Map" button on an [SI page](http://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:siris_ari_307082?q=record_ID%3Asiris_ari_307082&record=1&hlterm=record_ID%3Asiris_ari_307082), I end up in the middle of New York state, in the town of Norwich.  I'm pretty sure it's not there.  (Is the Smithsonian just using "the center of New York state"?)

But with some work on Google Maps, I could find [a similar perspective on
the piece](https://goo.gl/maps/eVpbm75Uqz22).  And the wonder of Google
maps is that I could also check out [the other side of
the scuplture, showing that there's still some graffiti](https://goo.gl/maps/fJZCVwvZ7yS2) which seems to go [all the way to the top](https://goo.gl/maps/p18Fuw1KhTD2).  Google Maps is way too much fun.  I also learned that Safari
does not like to include the images when I try to print and save as PDF,
but only after making four or five printouts.  But Google maps is way too
much fun.  I even created [some distored views](https://goo.gl/maps/VSVkTB1t9zD2) by looking in different directions.  [This one may be my favorite](https://goo.gl/maps/WCjYrnMfQSr).  Hmmm ... it might be fun to layer some different
perspectives on top of each other.  Oh well, that's an experiment for
another day.

That was definitely too much of a rabbithole.

[1] Should I say "electronic-mail message"?  

[2] At the time, he was Terry Fugate-Wilcox.  He's since dropped an "R"
from his name.

[3] The book blurb credits the work only to Fugate-Wilcox.  But it appears
that they collaborated on many aspects of the piece.

> No questions have ever been off-limits for white scholars. In Ibram
Kendi’s recent book, _Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History
of Racist Ideas in America_ (Nation Books, 2016), he tells us that in 1664,
Robert Boyle, the father of English chemistry, wrote in _Of the Nature
of Whiteness and Blackness_ that "the physics of light ... showed that
Whiteness was ‘the chiefest color.’ " Boyle claimed that these
were objective conclusions, uncolored by his personal opinions. Isaac
Newton was influenced by Boyle’s work when he said white light was the
standard from which all other colors derived. Boyle’s and Newton’s
claims weren’t objective. They were white. It is identity politics
that makes white scholars believe that their whiteness does not play a
role in the kinds of scholarly questions they ask.

But weren't Boyle and Newton writing about the physics of light?  As far
as I can tell, we know that the eye perceives that combination of
multiple colors as white: If you shine a red light, a green light,
and a blue light at a screen, the screen will be white.

Quote from Kandi

> The year before, Boyle had jumped into the ring of the racial debate
with _Of the Nature of Whiteness and Blackness_.  He rejected both curse
and climate theorists and knocked up a foundational antiracist idea: "The
Seat" of human pigmentation "seems to be the thin *Epidermes*, or
outward Skin," we wrote.  And yet, this antiracist idea of skin color
being onl skin deep did not stop Boyle from juding different colors.
Black skin, he maintained, was an "ugly" deformity of normal Whiteness.
The physics of light, Boyle argued, showed that Whiteness was "the chiefest
color."  He claimed to have ignored his personal "opinions" and "clearly"
and faithfully" presented the truth, as his Royal Society deeded.  As
Boyle and the Royle Society promoted the innovation and circulation of
racist ideas, they promoted objectivity in all their writings.

Now, I won't dispute that there are some significant problems with how
Boyle writes about race or his approach to slaves on
plantations.  But I can't find a claim that white skin

> A twenty-two-year-old unremarkable Cambridge student from a farming
family copied full quotations.  As he rose in stature over the next
forty years to beomce one of the most influential scientists of all
time, Isaac Netwon took it upon himself to substantiate Boyle's color
law: light is white is standard.  In 1704, a year after he assumed the
presidency of the Royal Society, Newton released one of the most
eminent books of the modern ear, _Opticks_.  "_Whiteness is produced
by the Convention of all Colors," he wrote.  Newton created a color
wheel to illustrate his thesis.  "The center" was "white of the first order," and all the other colors were positioned in relation to their "distance 
from Whiteness."  In one of the foundational books of the upcoming
European intellectual renaissance, Newton imaged "perfect whiteness."

> Exper. 14. Hitherto I have produced Whiteness by mixing the Colours of Prisms. If now the Colours of natural Bodies are to be mingled, let Water a little thicken'd with Soap be agitated to raise a Froth, and after that Froth has stood a little, there will appear to one that shall view it intently various Colours every where in the Surfaces of the several Bubbles; but to one that shall go so far off, that he cannot distinguish the Colours from one another, the whole Froth will grow white with a perfect Whiteness. [Pg. 150]

Interestingly, I also found this quotation.

> The first and only Colour which white Metals take by grinding their Particles smaller, is black, and therefore their white ought to be that which borders upon the black Spot in the Center of the Rings of Colours, that is, the white of the first order. [Pg. 259]

[Thank You](thank-you-01) (Essay #50)

> The first in a series of thank you notes.  This one is to someone who
  works at the JRC welcome desk.

[Feeling Fortunate](feeling-fortunate) (Essay #56)

> Not so much a thank you note to an individual as a reflection on
  all of the parts of my profession for which I am thankful.

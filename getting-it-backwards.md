Getting it backwards
====================

*This musing needs work!*

Songs rattle through my head all the time [1].  Usually I can keep them
separate.  But there are two songs whose lyrics I can never separate:
"The Ballad of Jesse James" and "Jesus Chris".  What are the lyrics?

Here is one set of lyrics for "The Ballad of Jesse James" [2].

> Jesse James we understand  
> Has killed many a man  
> He robbed the Union trains  
> He stole from the rich and gave to the poor  
> He had a hand and a heart and a brain

> Well it was on a Saturday night  
> The stars were shining bright  
> They robbed the Glendale train  
> And the people they did say from many miles away  
> It was those outlaws Frank and Jesse James

> Now Jesse had a wife  
> Lived a lady all her life  
> Her children they were brave  
> But history does record    
> That Bob and Charlie Ford  
> Have laid poor Jesse in his grave

> Well it was Bob and Charlie Ford  
> Those dirty little cowards  
> I wonder how they feel  
> For they ate of Jesse's bread  
> And they slept in Jesse's bed    
> And they laid poor Jesse in his grave

> Well the people held their breath  
> When they heard of Jesse's death  
> They wondered how he came to fall  
> Well it was Robert Ford in fact    
> Who shot him in the back  
> While he hung a picture on the wall

Here are the lyrics to "Jesus Christ".

> Jesus Christ was a man who traveled through the land  
> A hard-working man and brave  
> He said to the rich, "Give your money to the poor,"  
> But they laid Jesus Christ in His grave

> Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand  
> His followers true and brave  
> One dirty little coward called Judas Iscariot  
> Has laid Jesus Christ in His Grave

> He went to the preacher, He went to the sheriff  
> He told them all the same  
> "Sell all of your jewelry and give it to the poor,"  
> And they laid Jesus Christ in His grave.

> When Jesus come to town, all the working folks around  
> Believed what he did say  
> But the bankers and the preachers, they nailed Him on the cross,  
> And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.

> And the people held their breath when they heard about his death  
> Everybody wondered why  
> It was the big landlord and the soldiers that they hired  
> To nail Jesus Christ in the sky

> This song was written in New York City  
> Of rich man, preacher, and slave  
> If Jesus was to preach what He preached in Galilee,  
> They would lay poor Jesus in His grave.

You may not be able to tell it from the lyrics, but the two songs have
the same melody.  And so the words get mixed up in my brain.  For
example, "That Bob and Charlie Ford; they laid Jesus Christ in the
grave".

As you might know, one song is by Woody Guthrie and one is a classic
folk song.  As [I mentioned recently](guthrie-family-concert), Guthrie
was fond of re-purposing the tunes from old folks songs.  So when I 
think of the two songs, I think of "The Ballad of Jesse James" as
being a Woody Guthrie song and "Jesus Christ" as being a classic folk
song.  But that's backwards.  "The Ballad of Jesse James" is the
classic folk song [3] and "Jesus Christ" is Woody's variant.  Of course,
if I remembered the last verse, I wouldn't have trouble thinking of it
as a Woody Guthrie song.

It doesn't help that I've listened to the Pogue's version of "Jesse
James" way too many times.  For some reason, it's easier for me to think
about the Pogues covering Woody Guthrie than it is to think of them
covering an old American folk tone.

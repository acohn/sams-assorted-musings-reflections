Get Outlook for iOS!
====================

A surprising number of the messages I receive from students end with the
line ``Get Outlook for iOS''.

I'm always tempted to respond "**No thank you.  And why would you make 
such a suggestion?  Don't you know that I generally avoid Microsoft products
when I can [1]?**"

But then I realize that they probably didn't actually write that
suggestion.  It's probably not that they are being paid to shill for
Microsoft.  One option is that the Outlook app added it before they sent
it [2] and they are too lazy to take the time to remove the inappropriate
advertising text from their message or, better yet, to set a new default
signature.  Another option is that the Outlook app added it after they
sent it.  A less probable option is that our Outlook server knows that
I don't use Outlook for iOS and puts a suggestion into randomly selected
email messages.  But I find that doubtful.

So, here's the question.  How should I respond to such a suggestion?
Here's one possibility.

> Thank you for that suggestion.  Could you explain why you think it
would be useful for me to use Outlook for iOS and, more particularly,
why it is preferable to the default mail application on iOS.  For example,
does it support PGP [3]?

But that seems a bit over the top, even for me.  Maybe I should let
it go.

Or maybe I should even consider using Outlook for iOS.
After all, [at least one 'blog calls it the best iPhone mail
app](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-third-party-email-app-for-ios/)

Perhaps I should say.

> Thank you for that amazing recommendation.  I never would have
considered using Outlook for iOS without the constant reminders in
your email messages.  Using Outlook for iOS has transformed my life
and my phone.  Thank you thank you thank you.

But that would require me to try it.  And, well, I'm not all that
inclined to play around with new software this semester.  Maybe some
other day.

Get _insert name of software product_ for _insert name of operating
system_!

[1] Microsoft Word is clearly the ``lingua franca'' of a lot of
communication and so I do regularly work in word.  And, as much as I
hate to admit it, Powerpoint is sometimes useful when I want to make
something quickly.

[2] Perhaps as a default "Signature".

[3] I'm not sure that I want to run PGP on my iPhone; it feels like
a less secure device than my desktop.  But the question is worth
asking.

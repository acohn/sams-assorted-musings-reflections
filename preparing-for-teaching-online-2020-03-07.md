Yesterday morning, the faculty received a message from the President's
office [1] indicating that we should start making preparations to
teach online in case a COVID-19 outbreak or other event made that
necessary.  I'm glad that the College is trying to be proactive,
but I'm a bit worried about the implications.  As you might expect,
I responded with a variety of questions because the broader context
affects such plans [2].  That may not have been my wisest move.
Soon thereafter, I received a phone call from a VP who said
(approximately): "Most faculty have no experience teaching online
and have not thought about it.  What resources would you suggest
to help them get started?"

Now, I appreciate that folks are willing to draw upon my expertise
or something like my expertise.  However, I'm much less of an expert
in online education than I was, say, twenty years ago, when Web-based
education was new and I was closely involved in the EdMedia community.
Grinnell also has a variety of staff who teach online and who would
probably have good suggestions and could serve as resources to
others on campus [3].  So my initial inclinations were to (a) send
a note to my CTLA [4] colleagues, (b) talk to a few other folks on
campus, (c) send a note out to my broader community, (d) contact
the folks at [Global Online Academy](https://globalonlineacademy.org/),
who I've worked with before and who I know do a wonderful job at
teaching people to teach online.

It appears that Grinnell was being sensible.  Other schools are
making similar preparations.  Last night I heard that Stanford has
cancelled all in-person classes and finals and asked faculty to
move them online.  Now, there's only a week of classes left in this
quarter at Stanford, so it's not quite as much of a deal as it will
be if, say, we have to teach online for the last six weeks at
Grinnell, but it's still a huge decision.  Stanford has [a public
notice about the issue](https://teachanywhere.stanford.edu/) as
well as [some guidance for faculty](https://teachanywhere.stanford.edu/).

Back to Grinnell or at least to what happened when I reached out
from Grinnell.  Let's see.  My CTLA colleagues were already on the
issue.  They are working with ITS on identifying software that the
College needs and connecting faculty with training materials [5].
I also heard a very sensible reply of something like "The kind of
training you do for an emergency switch from in-person to online
is very different than that which you do when planning to teach
online from the start."  I'm also told that other faculty have been
asked to think about the issue.

Other friends and colleagues on campus pointed me to [a nice article
in _Chronicle_ about the benefits of doing some online teaching by
someone from
Grandview](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Teaching-Online-Will-Make-You/247031), another [_Chronicle_ guide to online teaching], and
a [community-developed document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NyrEU7n6IUl5rgGiflx_dK8CrdoB2bwyyl9XG-H7iw8/) created in response to the kinds of issues
Grinnell is dealing with.

I got a bunch of replies from the SIGCSE community.  Some folks
indicated that they were considering similar issues at their
institutions.  Some discussed the particular software that they
use; for example, one noted that they've found Blackboard Collaborate
quite useful for teleconferencing and another noted that they find
Piazza much better than Blackboard discussion groups for asynchronous
communication.  A faculty member who runs a company that makes online
software to support learning in CS volunteered their online software to
any institution that needed it for the rest of the semester.  I'll
be summarizing those issues in an email to the SIGCSE listserv and
will be happy to send it to anyone who asks.

I loved my response from GOA, which was, in essence: "We've decided
to offer [a free online class on this issue, starting next
week](https://globalonlineacademy.org/what-we-do/educator-courses/designing-for-online-learning).
I've signed up already.  I don't know if anyone from GOA reads my
musings, but if so *thank you* for this important contribution to
the broader educational community.

I'd say that that offering and the [Online Learning
Consortium's emergency preparedness
resource](https://onlinelearningconsortium.org/about/continuity-planning-emergency-preparedness-resources/)
along with other institutions' help pages are good starting places.  For
the last group, [Berkeley has a guide to synchronous remote course tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BegghqpCDo8YjZr9nIH5qN49GO8ssgwZSVKQt2Pp4dI/edit)
and [Stanford has provided its faculty with a useful guide that is also
helpful for others](https://teachanywhere.stanford.edu/).  I don't know who
is hosting it, but there's also 
a [broader document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NyrEU7n6IUl5rgGiflx_dK8CrdoB2bwyyl9XG-H7iw8/) available.

I thought it would also be useful, at least for myself, to put
together a few notes on the things individuals and the College might
consider in preparing to move to online teaching.  I will admit
that I have no good suggestions for folks whose teaching incorporates
inherently face-to-face activities, such as lab sciences or many
of the arts.  I also don't give closed-book exams, so I have no
good suggestion on what folks who are relying on those for finals
or such should do.  Nonetheless, perhaps some of my comments will
be of use to someone.

First, and most importantly, we need to make sure that students
have access to sufficiently powerful computers and to the Internet.
I believe we own enough laptops that we can address the first issue.
I don't know whether we're expecting to have students on campus,
in which case the Internet is covered, or away, in which case we'll
need to worry about it a bit.  Given lots of extra resources, we
could give students cellular connections to the Internet.

We also need to make sure that faculty and staff have access to
computing and the Internet.  Again, I don't know whether we're
expecting people to teach and support teaching and students from
on campus or from home.  Since Grinnell is rural, Internet access
from home is likely to be an issue for some.

In addition to making sure that students, faculty, and staff have
appropriately powerful computers, we will likely need to make sure
that they have the appropriate software.  I don't know enough about
our licensing to suggest a good approach. The two obvious ones are
to loan College computers that already have the software or to pay
to install or license software on more computers.

What about pedagogy?  Like face-to-face teaching, online teaching often
involves both synchronous and asynchronous teaching.  That is, there are
points at which you are interacting with students in real-time and points
in which you are not.  I'm a big fan of live discussions and even live
"lecture" because I think much is gained from hearing from others while
you learn.  I also know that most small-class in-person lectures involve
a good amount of dialogue.

There are a variety of systems available for synchronous teaching.
Most video chat and video conferencing applications [6] work well, although I'd suggest that
one that lets you do screen sharing (including allowing others to
take over the screen) can be particularly useful.  I know lots of
people who find Zoom particularly good for these situations; I've
used it primarily in online meetings with professional colleagues.
I believe Grinnell owns licenses to both GoToMeeting [7] and Skype
for Business.  I'm not sure what features those provide.  I also
don't know what features Blackboard Collaborate provides.  My sense
is that faculty who want to use video chat for synchronous work should
wait for a week, hear what ITS and CTLA are providing, and do some
training to see whether it will work as they expect.

One other feature I might consider is whether you can easily record
the session.  Recording can be useful not only for students who need
accommodations but also for students who want to review part of the
discussion.  However, it is essential that students understand and
agree to the loss of privacy inherent in recording classes.

If you rely on video, whether for video conferencing or for prepared
lectures, make sure that you consider accessibility issues.  Captioning
is now expected for most videos to support the deaf and other
hearing-impaired individuals.  But you should also consider
how you would support blind and other vision-impaired students.

There are also options for synchronous teaching beyond video
conferencing software.  Many people teach using text chat, rather
than video chat.  Text chat has some important advantages.  One
important advantage is that it likely requires much less bandwidth,
which can be helpful to students (and others) who have limited or
costly bandwidth.  I believe text chat also provides some accessibility
advantages in that it is accessible to the deaf and hearing-impaired
users and that "read aloud" systems can support the blind and
vision-impaired students.  Of course, text chat is less accessible
to some physically impaired students.  Text chat can also help some
quieter students feel more comfortable speaking up in class since
they have the tie and ability to carefully compose their comments.
Slack is one of the more popular chat applications and seems to
have seen growth not only in the computing community but also in
Digital Humanities and beyond.

The online learning community has found great value in asynchronous
discussions.  However, most of the studies that I've read compare
learning in asynchronous online discussions to learning in large
lecture classes; I'm yet to be convinced that asynchronous discussions
work as well as synchronous small-class discussions.  In any case,
some asynchronous discussions can be good.  Blackboard provides
discussion forums, which many faculty already use.  I believe
Grinnell has also paid for a Piazza integration.  In my online class,
I found the best interactions came either when I gave a pointed
question on the reading or asked students to comment on each-others'
work and required a minimum number of responses.

You may find it valuable to record lectures and screencasts
for your students.  If you choose to do so, I'd recommend that you
think about ways to break your lectures up into "chunks" of no more
than ten minutes or so.  The evidence seems to be that shorter
segments help students learn better.  Grinnell normally requires
that you caption your videos, but I've found that the folks in
Disability Resources support those endeavors.  I've also found that
"just in time" videos don't require initial captions unless you
have a student.  However, it's always a good idea to plan to caption.

One of the hardest, but most important, parts of online teaching,
at least from my perspective, is building community among the
students.  Fortunately, that's not an issue most Grinnell faculty
will need to worry about if they have to transition their face-to-face
courses to an online format; at this point in the semester, classes
are communities.

And that's what I have for now.  We'll see if I [8] come up with more in the
next few days.

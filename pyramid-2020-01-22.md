In a recent [musing about my undergraduate workload](samr-undergraduate-work-2019-12-28), I
mentioned the Pyramid computer that CS and Math shared.  The Pyramid
was an "interesting" computer; although Unix had been developed on
DECs, it was beginning to be ported to other architectures.  I
believe that the Pyramid was one of the first attempts to run Unix
on a different architecture.

I don't know much about the underlying details of the Pyramid [1], or
why we bought it instead of another DEC [5], but I do have some
memories of the computer.  In that earlier musing, I mentioned two:
We had a weak security model and my abuse of that model got me in
trouble.  Here are a few more.

The Pyramid always crashed the night before OS homework was due
because it couldn't handle the load of student work.  Each time,
the class instructor said something like, "In the real world, you
plan ahead for these kinds of situations" and then took off 10% if
our work wasn't in on time.  I may not have reacted in the way the
instructor expected.  I decided that the best approach was to begin
the work the day after it was due; the Pyramid crashed less often
so I was much more efficient, and I often ended up with no more of a
penalty than my classmates.

The Pascal compiler on the Pyramid turned case statements with
ranges into way too many conditional jumps.  For example, `case x
of 1..5000` resulted in 5000 conditional jumps rather than the two
or three that it should have produced.  I'm pretty sure that this
design led to the Pyramid crashing regularly, since you could
inadvertently fill temporary storage with an ill-designed range
[6].

Like most Unix systems, the Pyramid had a version of Emacs.  But it
didn't have real Emacs.  Just as the Pyramid was a clone of the DEC Unix
system, so was the Emacs a clone of the DEC-20 classic [7].  Hence,
instead of the original Emacs or GNU Emacs, we had Gosling Emacs
[8].  Since I had spent the past year or two mastering DEC-20 Emacs,
I considered Gosling Emacs a sin unto Emacs and learned vi instead
[10,14].

And that's all I remember about the Pyramid at the University of Chicago.

I wonder what happened to it when it got decommissioned.

[1] I see from [the Wikipedia
page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Technology) that they
were a RISC [2] system as compared to DEC's CISC system [3].

[2] Reduced-Instruction-Set Computer.

[3] Complex-Instruction-Set Computer.  I haven't looked at DEC assembly
for at least two decades, but I recall it being surprisingly close to
a high-level language [4].

[4] Or at least a high-level language for the time.

[5] We did have a DEC-20 running TOPS-20.

[6] I'm perfectly serious about that.

[7] [The Wikipedia page on Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs),
says that the original was built on the PDP-10, using TECO.

[8] Yes, James Gosling.  How many programmers name their programs
after themselves?  There's not a Gates DOS or a StevesOS, or a
Gaskins Powerpoint or even an AtkinsonCard [9].  On the other
hand, there is an operating system called Linux.

[9] I really miss HyperCard.

[10] Gosling has done some important work.  I would not include Gosling
Emacs nor the choice to name it after himself.  But what do I know?  I
was probably just an overly opinionated undergraduate [11,12].

[11] Is that redundant?

[12] Now I'm an overly opinionated faculty member.  Some things never
change.

[14]  [The Wikipedia page on Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs)
also tells me that GNU Emacs was based on Gosling Emacs, although it likely
no longer incorporates any of the code.  I wonder if it's closer to
Gosling Emacs or TOPS-20 Emacs.  It's been too long since I've used
TOPS-20 Emacs for me to venture a guess.

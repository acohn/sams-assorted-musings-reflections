More musings by others
======================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-musings), short*

I recently wrote about [the experience of seeing someone
else use the term "musing" for a short, reflective, piece of
writing](power-pop-musings).  It turns out that I've perhaps
been a little too restricted in what I read.  This evening, as
[I ranted about the state of Grinnell's Web](grinnell-web-governance),
I experimented with searches for things like "Grinnell course tags".
While [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=Grinnell+course+tags)
brings up my musings as the first two results,
[Bing](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Grinnell+Course+Tags) doesn't seem
to show them at all.

That surprised me.

So I decided to see what [Bing showed for "SamR's
musings"](https://www.bing.com/search?q=SamR's+musings).  While
[one of my indices](index-by-number)  shows up first, it's not
the site front door, and the second, fourth, and subsequent results have
nothing to do with me and both using the term musings.

The second result?  Something called [Sammusings: Relationship musings
& a few other miscellaneous items](https://sammusings.wordpress.com/).
It appears that (a) that Sam started musing long before I did, (b) that
Sam self-identifies as a woman, (c) that Sam has a very different set of
subject matter than I do; and (d) that Sam has only updated once in the
past two years.  I didn't read enough to see if she both muses and rants.

The fourth result?  [A one-off musing
on the SAMR model for technology in the
classroom](http://blog.kathyschrock.net/2013/11/sarm-model-musings.html).
No, the author did not invent the term.  Unfortunately, a name I've
been using for myself for three decades has become a stupid acronym for
classroom technology.

The fifth result?  Something titled "[Sam's
musings](https://samaderibigbe.com/).  This Sam, [Sam
Aderibigbe](https://samaderibigbe.com/about-2/) to be precise, is an
economist who appears to live in Nigeria.  He seems to post about once
a month, mostly about local political issues.

The sixth result?  A Facebook page entitled [The musings of
Sam](https://www.facebook.com/musingsofsam/) which appears to be BDSM
photographs.  This page seems to have started on July 12, 2016, a
few months after I started musing.

After that, we have a few more things about the SAMR model.

And then there are way too many others.

* [Blogging Sam: The musings of a guy... "Oh please! Musings? Don't make yourself sound so important, Sam."](http://www.bloggingsam.com/)
* [Sam's Music and Musings](http://samsmusicandmusings.blogspot.com/)
* [Sam's War Room - Historical and Political Musings](https://samswarroom.wordpress.com/)
* Another [Sam's Musings](https://sites.google.com/site/samsmusings/)
* And another [Sam's Musings](https://samsbanned.blogspot.com/2017/)
* [Sam Fitzpatrick - Life hacks and technological musings](https://samfitzpatrick.com/)

That's all I can bear to record.  By now, it's clear that I'm not unique.
Not only do many people use "musing" in their 'blogs (or other sites),
many people who refer to themselves as *Sam* use "musing" in their 'blogs.

Oh well, at least I write more than they do.  Plus, I add a capital "R".
And I rant.

Postscript: I am serious when I say that I hate that SAMR is an acronym
related to classroom technology.  Perhaps I should have trademarked
my name.

---

Postscript: It's okay to use SAMR as an acronmym for "SamR's Musings
And Rants".  I'll admit that it's not the most creative of acronyms and
that recursive acronyms are annoying.  Nonetheless, its an acronym with
which I can identify.

---

Postscript: I am surprised to see that Grammarly is once again
concerned about my use of the term "musing".  For example, when I
write "that Sam started musing long before I did", it wants me to
write "that Sam started *using* long before I did".  I don't appreciate
the implication.

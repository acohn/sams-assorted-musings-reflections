Musings you'll never read
=========================

*Topics/tags: [Meta musings](index-meta), rambly*

As you know from my recent [end-of-month musings](index-monthly), one of
my current goals is to read through the list of forthcoming musings and
categorize each musing.  But every time I step back and review the list
of forthcoming musings, I realize that there are musings I've planned
that ll never write as well as musings that I've started to write but
will never finish.  I thought it would be useful to reflect on a few
of them.

I saw _Hamilton_ last week.  I watched the kickoff performance of the
2018 Iowa Ambassadors of Music early this week.  I couldn't find the
energy to reflect on either performance the night of the performance.  And
it's really hard to muse about a performance more than a few days later.
So, while I may eventually muse about the Iowa Ambassadors of Music,
it won't be about that performance.  I'm not sure I'll ever muse about
_Hamilton_.  If I do, it will be about the cultural concept rather than
about the performance.

You may recall that I was on a cruise a few weeks ago.  The overpriced
Internet connection on the cruise was awful.  I spent some time on the
last day of the cruise writing about the awful connection and about the
experience of musing with an awful connection.  I thought those would be
the first musings I posted when I returned.  Then my computer crashed.
At this point, it's not worth finishing those musings.

Then there are the musings that were supposed to be drafts of things
that I was planning to write.  I was adding two new CSC 151 assignments
this semester, one on text generation and one on a very simple neural
network.  I thought that having them as prospective musings would 
encourage me to write early drafts.  But I ended up writing them when
I needed to post them and they never ended up as musings.  It seems
too late to post them.  The same is true of a report on the code camps
that I needed to provide to my funders.  Maybe the next report on the
code camps will appear as a musing [1].

[1] Certainly, some of the musings about the code camps will provide
fodder for that report.

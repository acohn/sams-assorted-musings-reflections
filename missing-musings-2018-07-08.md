Musings you'll never read
=========================

*Topics/tags: [Meta musings](index-meta), rambly*

As you may recall from some recent [end-of-month musings](index-monthly),
one of my current goals is to read through the list of forthcoming musings
and categorize each musing.  But every time I step back and review the
list of forthcoming musings, I realize that there are musings I've planned
that I'll never write as well as musings that I've started to write but will
never finish.  I thought it would be useful to reflect on a few of them.

I saw _Hamilton_ last week.  I watched the kickoff performance of the
2018 Iowa Ambassadors of Music early this week.  I couldn't find the
energy to reflect on either performance on the night of the performance.
It's really hard to muse about a performance more than a few days
later.  So, while I may eventually muse about the Iowa Ambassadors of
Music, it won't be about that performance.  I'm not sure I'll ever muse
about _Hamilton_.  If I do, it will be about the cultural concept rather
than about the performance.

You may recall that I was on a cruise a few weeks ago.  The overpriced
Internet connection on the cruise was awful.  I spent some time on the
last day of the cruise writing one musing about the awful connection
and another about the experience of musing with an awful connection.
I thought those would be the first musings I posted when I returned.
Then my computer crashed.  At this point, it's not worth finishing
those musings.

Then there are the musings that were supposed to be drafts of things that
I was planning to write.  At the end of spring semester, I added two new
CSC 151 assignments [1], one on text generation and one on a very simple
neural network.  I thought that having them as prospective musings would
encourage me to write early drafts.  But I ended up writing them when
I needed to post them and they never ended up as musings.  It seems too
late to post them.  The same is true of a report on the code camps that
I needed to provide to my funders.  Maybe the next report on the code
camps will appear as a musing [2].

It's a bit sad to realize that these musings will never appear [3].
Nonetheless, I've learned to accept that I'll never write everything I
plan.  After all, the number of potential topics seems to grow each month.
As topics age, they may become less relevant.  There are also a number of
cases in which I no longer remember what I meant when I listed a topic;
what did I mean when I just wrote "hyphenation" as a topic or "application
for Google thingy"?  In the former case, I've already written about [the
stupid joke](anal-retentive), so I'm not sure what else I was thinking.
In the latter, I'm not even sure what I was thinking of applying for.

Oh well.  At least I got to muse indirectly about these topics.

[1] More precisely, I added two parts to one assignment.  Students could
choose which of the assignments to do.

[2] Certainly, some of the musings about the code camps will provide
fodder for that report.

[3] It's also sad to realize that I spent effort on musings that I'll
never finish.  That's okay, though.  I got the pleasure of drafting
them and I won't get utility from completing them.

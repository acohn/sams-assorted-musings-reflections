Another good rant ruined
========================

I was all set to rant about the Grinnell Career Connections program [1],
but then reality got in the way.  Here's the story.

If you didn't know, the Grinnell Career Connections program is a new
initiative at the Office of Careers, Life, and Service.  Rather than
using the traditional model of having a graduate school counselor,
a few internship counselors, and so on and so forth, they are creating
"communities" that focus on particular groups of careers.  Hence, the
same person who talks to a student about internships can also talk to
them about post-graduation options.  In addition, students can form a
kind of community, working with each other to better understand various
opportunities and to help each other prepare.

Why would I rant about such a wonderful idea?

I would not rant about the general concept.  It's a pretty good one.

But I was tempted to rant about some details.  What details, you may
ask?  Let's start with the list of communities:

> Arts, Media, & Communications [2]; Business & Finance [3]; 
Education Professions [4]; Government & Social Service; Health
Professions; Law; and STEM [5].

What's wrong with this list?  Well, end-note one should be a clue.
Here's another problem: the sciences are quite vast.  The support a
CS or Math major who is planning on a quantitative position needs is
very different from what a Biology major who plans on a lab job needs.
I'd expect that these fields are much further apart than, say, Law and
Government.  In addition, 45% of Grinnell majors are in the sciences [7],
so one might hope that 45% of the communities would be related to the
sciences, which would suggest that we should have three STEM-communities,
rather than two.  Given that 1/7 of all majors are in CS or Math, we
should probably separate the STEM community into a Science Community
and a CS/Math [10] community.

But the communities were decided, in large part, but what people were
willing to donate to.  Daniel '77 and Patricia '80 Finkelman Dean [11]
Mark Peltz spent endless hours talking with donors across the country
about these communities, and the donations he raised shaped the choice
of communities.  As I understand it, we expect the set of communities
to evolve over the years.  So I really shouldn't complain.

I also shouldn't complain about the budget allocated to each community.
Again, it's not like we had one magic pot of money to distribute among
the communities based, say, on the number of students in each community.
Rather, the budgets are based on donations raised, along with some more
adjustable funds.

So there we have it.  We have a cool new initiative.  I don't particularly
like some of the details, but CLS [12] doesn't have control over many
of those details.  I was so looking forward to ranting, but I'll have
to leave it at that.  I don't even feel comfortable ranting about the
lack of public information about the new communities on the Web site,
since I know that putting stuff together takes time.  


I look forward to seeing what happens with the communities over the next
few years.  And I applaud the folks at CLS for coming up with the big
picture idea.

I'm worried that I will lose my curmudgeon badge [14].

[1] I'd link to the part of the Grinnell site that discusses the program, 
but there isn't one.

[2] A.k.a., "Let's shove all of the humanities disciplines into a
single community".

[3] I thought this was going to be an endnote in which I wrote, "Thank
you, Patricia Jipp '80 and Dan '77 Finkelman."  But it turns out that
I should write, "Thank you, [Penny Bender Sebring '64 and Charles
Lewis](https://www.grinnell.edu/news/supporting-career-community-model)."

[4] "Thank you, [Penny Bender Sebring '64 and Charles
Lewis](https://www.grinnell.edu/news/supporting-career-community-model)."

[5] Science, Technology, that subject we don't do at Grinnell [6], and
Mathematics.

[6] Engineering.

[7] Here are my calculations, based on the class of 2018.  There are
386 students who have 505 majors between them [8]  233 of those majors
(46%) are in STEM fields.  I'm too lazy to count the percent of the
386 students who have majors in the sciences.

[8] 119 students or about 30% of students seem to have two majors [9].

[9] As far as I know, there are no triple majors in the class of 2018.
The only triple major I know of graduated last year.

[10] TEM?

[11] Finkeldean?

[12] Careers, Life, and Service.

[14] Communications has already told me that I can't get a new one.
Sniff.

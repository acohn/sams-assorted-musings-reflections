Musings with multiple entries
=============================

*Most frequently, when I revisit a topic, I make a new document.  However,
in a few cases, such as [the CS FAQ](cs-faq), it makes more sense to 
extend an existing document, rather than to create a new one.  I keep the
old entries for those musings in this file.*

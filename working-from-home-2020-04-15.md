Two weeks ago, [I shaved my head](april-fools-2020).  Part of the
goal of that unpredictable activity was to shock myself into being
more efficient or at least more on task.  A week later, [I reported
on the effects](post-head-shave-2020-04-08).  In that week, I seem
to have been good at doing "appropriate" work, but I was spending
too much time each day working and perhaps too much time on email.
The latter may be unavoidable.  I also found that I enjoyed writing
sketch logs of what I did each day, although they seemed to get
fairly excessive toward the end of that first week.

In any case, since that week was successful in so many ways, I thought
I'd try to make it a somewhat weekly thing.  So here's my next log of
working from home.  I've mixed things up a bit.  Lets start with a
summary of my primary goals and how often I met each goal in the past
week.

* Read professional materials: 
* Read for fun: 
* Did something related to creativity: Thursday
* Worked on straightening home office:
* Did other professional work (not including email): Thursday
* Exercised:
* Mused: Thursday

Important activities for the week, beyond the basics above.

* Draft schedule for one of my summer workshops.
* Draft of Tutorial.
* Leaves!  We have many piles of leaves outside.  The city is doing
  free pickup on Monday.  I should get our various sets of leaves
  raked up before that.  Maybe I can get help.
* Review peer's book.
* Work on next piece for Ralph's class (due April 28)
  to revise).  Need time to refine and edit.  Also to do some background
  research.
* Dining room.
* Write the list of creative activities.
* Organize my 100-word notes for Ralph's class.
* Consider/implement inbox bankruptcy.

_Day Eight (Thursday)_.  Up before 7am.  Impressed that my body can
continue to wake me up about five minutes before I set my alarm.
Fold laundry.  Downstairs to prep for class.  Check email first.
Probably not my best plan.  But not too much to deal with right
now.  Ask about books for the fall.  Realize I missed a Bradway
reading on interviewing and skim it quickly.  Class.  Chat with
colleague after class.  Help Michelle with PPDs.  Straighten dining
room (where I've been working) and front room (where we've been
hanging out).  Make myself lunch.  (Leftover meatloaf, roasted roma
tomatoes, fresh-ish mozzerela, roast green pepper, all toasted on
a hunk of Italian bread.  Yum!) Start work on part of dinner, a
variant of "Adena's super simple spinach lasagna", which she taught
me thirty-five years ago [1,2,3].  Thought about working on the
home office, but realized that Youngest Son is online for class
[4].  Consider going outside to read, but it's a cold and grey day
[5].  Consider doing a task that requires only some attention while
also watching TV.  But YS is streaming class, I probably shouldn't
do so.  Start list of important activities to do this week [8].
Worry that the list seems moderately reasonable.  Realize that I've
barely read email today.  Deal with email.  Wish I could be watching
TV simultaneously [9].  Think about attending Webex meeting to
discuss teaching online.  Realize that I'll need to go to [my new
office](newer-office-2020-04-07) in order to do so.  Change my mind.
Back to email.  Try to figure out some aspects of Microsoft Teams.
Write email to my ITS trainer.  Spent some time trying to figure
out Microsoft Booking.  Like most Microsoft products, it is less
intuitive than the other software I use, but I seem to have gotten
it working well enough for my needs.  Now I have to update my links.
Make dinner.  Remember that I haven't backed up most of my computing
equipment in some time.  Set up backups.  More email.  Muse while
watching a Carlene Carter livecast.  Realize that it's probably
time to stop working.  Check a little more email just in case.

> I mused.  I did something creative. (I'm counting class.)  I
didn't work on my home office.  (I could count cleaning elsewhere
in the house, but it's not the same thing.)  I didn't exercise, but
I'm not sure that I was up to it physically.  I didn't read for
pleasure.  I didn't really read anything professional.  (I was
thinking of counting the documentation I read for Microsoft Teams
and Microsoft Booking, but those shouldn't count.)  Why did the day
fly by?

_Day Nine (Friday)_.  Up at about 8:30 a.m.  Sleeping in is nice.
But consistent to-bed and get-up times are probably better over the
long term.  Start load of sheets.  Realize that when I shaved my
head, I bled on my pillowcase.  Hydrogen peroxide doesn't work as
well as I thought it would.  Shout works a little better [10].
Check email; it's more reasonable than normal, but still takes about
45 minutes to process.  Consider implementing another inbox bankruptcy.
Maybe next week.  Add to list.  Consider doing some reading for
pleasure.  Decide I should work on at least one of the major tasks
on my list first.  Feel tired, consider going back to bread.  Bald
brain kicks in.  Make myself breakfast [11,12].  Try not to worry
about the future of my country and the world.  It doesn't help that
we had to read an excerpt from _Nickle-and-Dimed_ yesterday.  Draft
musing.  Start setting up the Web site for my next Tutorial.  Try
to figure out an error athat reads "Blocked loading mixed active
content".  Decide that I've worked hard this week, and spend some
time reading for pleasure.  Appreciate the sun outside, but wish
it were warmer so that I could sit outside and read.  Choose to
read inside by the window instead.  Watch Tech Studies presentation.
Log off early to give bandwidth to YS.  Talk with Michelle.  Continue 
reading while watching Jon Richardson piano bar.  Talk with Michelle.
Watch Jon Richardson attempt to do _The Sound of Music_ in thirty
minutes.  Enjoy all sixty of those thirty minutes.  Back to a bit
of reading.  Try to watch the [sing-a-long _Hamilton_](https://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/hamathome-live-sing-along-of-entire-hamilton-album-with-cast-members).  But it appears to have been cancelled.  Boo!  Decide to listen
to [The Vandoliers](https://www.facebook.com/Vandoliers/) live show
instead.  There's also a recording of _Jesus Christ Superstar_ that
Andrew Lloyd Weber has released for 48 hours, but I can watch that later.
Work on learning more features of Microsoft Bookings while musing
about it (or muse about Microsoft Bookings while learning more about
it).  Realize that I spent about two hours on that last task and it's
10:30 p.m.  Another fifteen minutes to finish up.  Then I decide to
explore a few parts of the latest [AAUP Salary
Survey](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/2019_20_appendices_sec.pdf).
Next it's time to read a bit more and then head for bed [14].

> There were definitely some positives for today.  I got some time to
do creative activities.  I spent time on important professional stuff
(learning new software but also Tutorial).  I mused.  On the other
hand, I did not work on my home office, I did not exercise, and I did not
do any professional reading.  Tomorrow I'm going to finish the book for
the Rebelsky Reading Group [15]

[1] When she first gave me the recipe, I had assumped that "regatta
cheese" was an unintentional, rather than an intentional misspelling.
I don't recall how long it took for her to tell me that I was an idiot.
I assume it's about thE time she explained the hyphenation joke to me.

[2] It's hard to believe it's been thirty-five years.  Now I feel even
older.

[3] How did I vary it?  Well, I was working from memory, which almost
certainly ensures that it was not an exact duplicate.  I also had some
leftover roux, so I used that to make a cheese b√©chamel sauce.  We'll
see how it all turns out tonight.

[4] Given the voice I was hearing, I think he was watching a recording.

[5] Or perhaps "gray day" [6].

[6] Insert traditional joke about Sam's experience at UofC [7].

[7] "Back when I was in College, more precisely, *The* College 
at *The* University of Chicago, the sky was gray, the buildings
were gray, even the president was Gray."

[8] See above.

[9] I don't usually watch TV while dealing with email, but it felt like
the right thing today.

[10] No, not shouting.

[11] No, my bald brain did not say "Make yourself breakfast."  It
said "No napping.  And do real work before you play."  It did,
however, acknowledge that I might need some energy to accomplish
those things.

[12] Sorry, family, I'm not Catholic.  I don't have to fast today.

[14] I almost wrote "head for bead".  But that doesn't rhyme.

[15] I should have done that today.

[16] I think we hear Monday whether we do in-person or online workshops.
I'd lay money on the latter, so that's what I planned.

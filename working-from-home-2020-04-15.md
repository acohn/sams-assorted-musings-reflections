Two weeks ago, [I shaved my head](april-fools-2020).  Part of te goal was
to shock myself into being more efficient.  A week later, [I reported
on the effects](post-head-shave-2020-04-08).  In that week, I seem to have
been good at doing "appropriate" work, but I was spending too much time
each day working and perhaps too much time on email.  The latter may be
unavoidable.  I also found that I enjoyed writing sketch logs of what
I did each day, although they seemed to get fairly excessive toward the
end of that first week. 

In any case, since that week was successful in so many ways, I thought
I'd try to make it a somewhat weekly thing.  So here's my next log of
working from home.  I've mixed things up a bit.  Lets start with a
summary of my primary goals and how often I met each goal in the past
week.

* Read professional materials: 
* Read for fun: 
* Did something related to creativity:
* Worked on straightening home office:
* Did other professional work (not including email):
* Exercised:
* Mused:

Nonsequitors anonymous
======================

*Topics/tags: [Autobiographical](index-autobiographical), short*

Some time back, I posted a rant about [the design of our new business cards](business-cards).  What was the first reply?

> Whatever happened to "Nonsequiturs anonymous"?

I'd completely forgotten about that part of my life.  Back when I was in 
graduate school, I engaged in a variety of silly activities.  In this
particular case, I made up business cards for an organization called
"Nonsequiturs anonymous".  I have no idea why.  I'm pretty sure that our 
slogan was

> We may not make sense, but we sure do like pizza!

I wonder if I have any of those cards left.  If I do, they are likely in
one of the too-many boxes that still have not been unpacked from one of
my moves [1]

Postscript: In the interests of accessibility, Grinnell now permits a second
design of business cards that, while not particularly attractive, is at
least more readable and makes human names as large as department names.

[1] Move 1: Chicago to Dartmouth.  Move 2: Dartmouth to first Grinnell 
office. Move 3: First Grinnell office to second Grinnell office.  [2]

[2] Amazingly, I've unpacked all the boxes from the move from my second
Grinnell office to my third Grinnell office.

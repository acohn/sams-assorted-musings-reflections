A note on SamR's musings for members of SIGCSE-members
======================================================

*Topics/tags: [Miscellaneous](index-misc), short*

Recently, someone on the SIGCSE-members mailing list asked about good
'blogs on computer science education.  For some reason, "SamR's musings"
ended up on the list of recommendations.  This note is for the SIGCSE
folks who have ended up here unexpectedly.

Dear SIGCSE Colleague,

I will admit that I'm not sure why someone recommended my musings as a
good 'blog on Computer Science education.  While I am a computer
science educator and active in SIGCSE, I write about a wide variety
of topics.  Only a small percentage of what I post has to do with CS
education [1].  

If you are looking for past posts related to CS ed, the best places to
look are [my posts on teaching](index-teaching), many of which are
also about teaching CS, [my notes on teaching C and *nix](index-cnix),
which served as prototype readings for a class I taught in spring 2017,
or [my notes on "the joy of code"](index-joc), which contains some random
comments on programs I've enjoyed writing or reading.

Other than that, you'll mostly finding me alternately
praising and [ranting](index-rants) about issues at [Grinnell
College](index-grinnell), the institution at which I teach, or [whining
about my workload](index-overcommitment).  But, hey, if you find those
topics of interest [2], you should feel free to read [3].

-- SamR

[1] I do have readers who are also computer science educators,
but most of them are friends and are not reading just to think more
broadly about CS education..

[2] Or even if you don't.

[3] You'll also find a variety of other topics.  Many readers
find it easiest to skim the subjects in the [list of musings by
number](index-by-number).

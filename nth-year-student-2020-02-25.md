Sometime in the distant past, a parent on the Grinnell Parents
Facebook page asked about the terms we use for students.  It went
something like this.

> I like the terms 1st year, 2nd year, etc. instead of freshman,
sophomore, etc.  Does anyone know how those got started?

I don't know when they got started, but I like to claim that there
are reasons that we use them.

We use "first-year student" instead of "freshman" because "freshman"
is a gendered term.  Some schools use "frosh", which is less gendered,
but somehow feels more insulting.  I've tried to suggest that we
use "freshling", which I find conveys their appropriate similarity
to ducklings.

We use "second-year student" instead of "sophomore" because "sophomore"
is potentially an insulting term ("wise fool", if I recall correctly).
I've been known to suggest that using that term to only one year
of Grinnell students is inappropriately limiting [1].

We use "third-year student" instead of "junior" because "junior" suggests
that they are below someone or less worthy of consideration.  I appear
unable to come up with witticisms about this term.

We use "senior" for our seniors.  I'm not sure why we don't continue
the trend and just call them "fourth-year students".

We used a similar set of terms at the University of Chicago when I was
an undergraduate.  But I recall a very different rationale.  Mine went
like this: 

> So few students graduate from Chicago in four years that it seems
inappropriate to use only four terms.  Students are therefore
first-years, second-years, third-years, fourth-years, and so on and
so forth until they reach their final year, which we call their
senior year.

Of course, that claim doesn't explain Cobb Gate.  We'll leave that
issue as a challenge for the reader [2].

Rumor also had it that if you walked on the great seal in the front
entrance of Reynolds Club, you would not graduate in four years.

It worked for me.  I was never a third-year [3].

**_Postscript_**: That's an idea!  As long as we're adding stonework
to Grinnell, perhaps we should add an equivalent to Cobb Gate.  But
we could do an Iowa twist on it, perhaps with ears of corn or pioneers
(or pies on ears) instead of gargoyles.

[1] Yes, I intend that as a joke.  The "freshlings" thing, not so much.

[2] Or the subject of a future musing.

[3] I know; I'm a braggart.  I also wanted to save money.  And,
since I had been accepted to remain for graduate school, I expected
that I could take the same classes as a graduate student and be
paid, rather than staying as an undergraduate, and pay.

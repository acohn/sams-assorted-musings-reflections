Another month of daily musings
==============================

*Topics/tags: [Meta-musings](index-meta), long*

Believe it or not, but it's the end of another month of musings.  It
was a month in which I missed some musings and had a variety of short
musings.  Nonetheless, it's worth following my habit of using the last
musing of the month to reflect on where the musings have been and
where the musings will go, to look backward and forwards.

My notes say that I thought I was starting with long musings, but as I
go back and look at the musings, it seems that they were more rambly
than long.  It also seems like the start of the month was mostly
short musings.  That makes sense; I was worn out from the end of the
semester and the summer started with a lot of work.  But that's okay;
there's nothing wrong with short musings.  And, while I'd prefer not to
ramble too much, I'm told that some of my rambly musings are also among
some of my better musings.  That's not to say that my better-organized
musings are not also good.  Still, I can get by.

I ended up taking two breaks from musing.  Being on vacation led me to
take a week-long break, not only because of the different schedule,
but also because of a horrid Internet connection.  It appears that I
worried some readers because my last musing before taking a break was
based on being fed nuts that I was allergic to.  I also took a one-day
break because I was out until midnight with my family at _Hamilton_
[3].  I did write an extra musing the next day to make up for things.
But I think I'm further behind than I used to be.  Let's see ... the
[end-of-month musing for June 2017](eleven-months) was number 361.
This musing is number 672.  I'm 311 musings ahead of a year ago.
Two months ago, I was 310 musings ahead.  I'm staying on pace.
Perhaps that's because "I posted eighteen musings in June [2018]" [4].

I'm now in my second month of tagging my musings.  It's not quite as
exciting as I had thought.  Usually, I have a primary musing and then
some of "short", "long", and "rambly".  But I still appreciate spending a
minute or two thinking about the issue.  I'm not sure how my readers feel.
I'm starting to add tags to my list of forthcoming musings so my muse
can more easily support me in finding topics to muse about.

As I was continuing to use the tags, I also started to find that
I was getting frustrated at adding yet another musing to certain
long lists of musings, particularly [miscellaneous](index-misc)
and [writing](index-on-writing).  So I created four new lists:
[language](index-language), "[meta musings](index-meta) [1], [code
camps](index-code-camps), and [email](index-email).  I'm not sure
that anyone other than me pays attention to the indices. Nonetheless,
I appreciate having them.  I will have to spend some time moving musings
to these new indices; we'll see when that happens.

As I noted [recently](strunk-white-and-williams), I think it's time to
work a bit more on my writing.  Short musings should allow me to go back
and edit.  But they're usually short not so much because the topic is
naturally short but rather because I don't have a lot of time to muse.
Still, it will be valuable to reread Williams and then to apply his
principles consciously, rather than subconsciously.  I hope I have the
time to do so [3].

My family has made an interesting request for this month.  The first
suggested that I only write positive musings.  I don't think that's
positive.  So we compromised.  I'm going to try not to post any rants
in July.  That will be hard; I already had a few rants queued up.  But,
as we saw [in May](another-month-2018-05), when I rant too much, it 
negatively affects my mood.

I've also restarted my [Sisyphean quest for inbox
zero](inbox-zero-revisited-01).  One way I'll help myself achieve that
goal is to muse about the status of my inbox once per week.  I hope those
won't be rants.  But there will certainly be instances of frustration.
And, whether they realize it or not, I was trying to rant less in June.
For example, I managed to avoid ranting about the new College nametags
because I knew that it would not be healthy to do so [6].

There you have it.  I wrote short and rambly musings this month and
ranted less than normal.  I plan to write short and rambly musings next
month and to rant as little as possible.  But I also plan to work harder
on editing [7], at least is I have time.  We shall see.

Postscript: For the past few months, I've done a "data dump" of the
categories and numbers of forthcoming musings as part of my end-of-month
musing.  I was considering separating that data dump into a separate
musing.  However, I'm not sure that counts of forthcoming musings are
interesting to anyone but me.  So they're staying here for now.

Every month, I say that I might rearrange the list of forthcoming musings
in the coming month.  I made a few more changes than normal this month
but didn't quite succeed.  I did, however, start tagging the forthcoming
musings so that my muse could more easily lead me to the right musing
each day.  For example, I can grep for "short" if I want one of the
musings that I think will be short and I can grep for "draft" if I'm in
the mood for editing something that has a substantial draft.  I can grep
for both if I want something that is short and in draft form.  I look
forward to the time when I have all of the musings tagged; then I can
look at the statistics in a very different way.  I hope to do more
tagging and rearranging in August [8].

As is the norm, I've increased the number of forthcoming musings.
Aren't lists of topics supposed to get shorter when I write?  But that's
okay; I know that I'll drop some when I continue tagging and rearranging
the lists.  Having that many topics means that I should find it easy to
have a month without ranting.  We'll see.

Postscript: There's one more thing I forgot.  I have an RSS feed for the
musings.  My normal plan is to clean it out each month.  I forgot to do
so last month.  But I remembered today.

[1] I just went through and moved most of the meta musings to the
"meta" section from the "on writing" section.  That doesn't leave
much in the "on writing" section.  And now I find myself asking
whether the end-of-month musings need their own section.  Oh well;
that's a task for another month [2].

[2] I know from software design projects that putting off tasks like
that just make it worse.  So I just moved all of the end-of-the-month
musings (or at least most of them) to [their own list}(index-monthly).

[3] I'm surprisingly good at committing to too much over the summer.  I've
mentioned my plans for the next few weeks in a prior musing, but I'll 
probably muse more extensively on the project soon.

[4] No, I'm not going to muse about seeing the Des Moines premiere of
_Hamilton_.

Musing #361 of _SamR's Assorted Musings and Rants_.  Available
online at <https://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/eleven-months>.

[6] And no, I'm not going to rant about them.

[7] And, therefore, on my writing.

[8] I normally say "in the coming month".  But I don't really anticipate
having enough time in the coming month, particularly as I deal with issues
relating to inbox zero.

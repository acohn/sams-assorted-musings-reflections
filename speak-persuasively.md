Helping our students learn to speak persuasively
================================================

* Problem of the open curriculum.
* Tutorial?  But problem of academic freedom.
* Perhaps compare to writing.
* Lowest on our alumni survey (or at least a few years ago, when I
  last looked).
* Class formats: Discussion/argumentative class + Presentations +
  Paper-Chase lite.
* Campus roles, particularly peer educators.
* Self-gov; students need to learn to argue persuasively in front of
  others for their goals.
